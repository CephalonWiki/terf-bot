It stimulates GnRH release, which upregulates sex hormone production and inhibits receptors for estrogen in the brain that would turn \'off\' the signal. As a result, the hypothalamus perceives the body to have low estrogen, and upregulates gonadotropin (FSH and LH) production. These stimulate the ovaries to produce more estrogen. As ovary follicles develop they in turn produce more estrogen. It works for infertility because high estrogen is needed at that phase of the cycle to get a follicle to rupture for ovulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClomiphene is banned by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_WADA). So females can\'t use drugs to increase their estrogen production as a treatment for PCOS and infertility, but TiMs can pop all the estrogen that pleases them without regulation to treat their genderfeels.

bhulic,bhulic,I can't do this any more; I need to divorce my trans wife.,"Married 10 years. We have two children 6, & 3. I'm 29, she's 31. This is probably going to be rambly, sorry. 

Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here. She's hated my wife since the moment wife and I met so I honestly don't know if she's a good person to talk about this to or if she's telling me what she thinks I want to hear. The only other person I've talked to about this is my sister and she thinks we should go back to couple's therapy. Friend told me what to expect from this sub and I've been lurking for a few days; for the sake of writing I'm going to refer to my wife as ""her"", because I don't want to accidentally call her 'him' offline -that's not pleasant for anyone the occasional time I slip up. 

Call her whatever you like when you reply, she's not going to see it and I have other things to think about. 

My wife is a trans woman and came to terms with it three years ago. Told me, started transitioning and all that. I love her. This wasn't a deal breaker and we talked to a couple's therapist and honestly everything was fine except for a few issues around my pregnancy and then our newborn. (Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)). 

We both work full time, and the budgets tight. Neither of us have a degree and we both only make a little more then minimum wage. We weren't perfect financially before our second child was born, but things weren't so tight.

I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras that I got with my first pregnancy after I outgrew my other bras. I don't wear makeup besides a bit of mascara and colored lip-gloss, and my skin care routine is simple as is my hair routine (I cut it myself and don't dye it or anything). I'm low maintenance  partially because I can't justify buying myself a new cheap bra when that $20 could go to our debt or something the kids need or something the kids want and partially because I don't feel like I need to wear a ton of makeup or stuff like that.  

My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.
 
We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs. 

I was fine with it all at first; writing this off as part of the costs of transition. I realize now though, that my wife is not going to *stop* racking up credit card debt for these things she thinks she needs. I go without, because I don't feel as though anything I want like a new bra is that needed for the family to incur more debt or to pay off that less debt that month. 

Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there. 

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would *help* because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it. 

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores. 

Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace came off her bra, thinking to myself ""I could have fixed it, come on, there's no need to act like this. And why is she so upset when she has four times the amount of bras then I do and hers are all much nicer than mine?"" Then I wondered why the hell I was doing her laundry, my laundry, and our children's laundry? She never does laundry.

She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't handle that. She called her friends in so there was a friend of hers at our home with them the *entire* time. By the way, she completely dropped all of her old friends and now the only friends she has are also trans women or non-binary or whatever. So that was a fun conversation to have because I only know like two of her friends well enough to babysit my children and she can't possibly know everyone to know they're safe to have around our kids. I got called transphobic for that one, by the way. She apologized, but the very fact that's what she jumped on instead of my concerns about who is in close contact with our kids? And maybe I'm paranoid, but I was molested as a child by a family friend which she *knows*. 


Oh, and her friends...besides the two I know, everyone else just aren't very nice to me if we at a gathering or host a party. I'm treated like the help instead of the cohost. Most of them have no interest in getting to know me or even talking to me and are on the edge of rude. She doesn't see it. 

I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything.  It honestly wasn't this bad when she was my husband. 

A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper city to live where we would buy a house. 

Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave""

Which stung, by the way. My current employer had me back at work three weeks after our 3 year old was born. They claimed there was an issue somewhere along the way and if I wanted to keep my job I needed to come back that soon. Probably not legal, but I was in no position to find out for sure. 

I told her that if we have the money for one of us to go back to school and stay at home with a baby, it's going to be ME. And brought up how long it took for me to fully heal from giving birth when I had to work -on top of the knowledge that I was missing out on time with our newborn. 

So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her, and how *she* felt watching me while I was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or of knowing she could never be pregnant and on and on and how another baby that she did the majority of care for would be her chance to be a real mother. And I ended up tuning her out, wondering if she's always been this selfish and self centered or if it was new. The conversation ended with us deciding to talk about it closer to my birthday. 

Maybe it's me, I don't know, but hearing her talk about having maternity leave when I was the one who would be giving birth, dealing with all that comes with that made me angry, really honestly angry for the first time in a long time. What kind of partner would be so callous? And it dawned on me that we aren't really in a real partner ship any more. I love her, but that's just not enough any more. 

**I just can't do this anymore.**

**Edit:** I already have meetings to talk to a few different lawyers and see what they say/how I feel about them next week. Like I commented, I think I was mainly posting here to be told I'm not a shitty person throwing away my marriage...I just want some support that's not biased towards my spouse I think. 

My older brother has already received his inheritance and is fully willing to let me borrow as much as I need for a good lawyer. I didn't talk to him about why I was thinking about a divorce like I did with my sister, just that I was....I think he's probably better to talk about this with then my sister given as soon as I said ""lawyer"" he immediately offered to loan me the money without me even asking.

**Edit Again:** Please don't pm me if you are trans or the spouse of a trans person, thank you. And I don't know what on earth a 'terf' is, why it's bad to be one or how to be one.",1545,"[""\nWelcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

To me, it says that even on the outside looking in, your brother knows something isn\'t right with your marriage even beyond the trans aspects. That your brother is, as a man, looking at the track record of your wife/husband and finding it lacking. The trans aspect of this situation is just the candy coating most people might see first, hiding the truth of the matter, which is that your wife/husband does not partake equally in homemaking, childrearing, or financially.', ""My husband and I went through some really rough times financially. One time he went to see some friends and they sent him home with some of their leftover pizza. We were living on food banks and had been eating rice and beans for days at that point.

That's how it was with *everything* then, or we'd try to give the other person the better share.\n\nI know I wouldn't want to go through life and raise kids with someone who isn't in it as a partner.

You have kids, which they may see as a way to hurt or control you.\n\nYou\'re seeing the very best of their behavior right now because you have something they want- inheritance and a chance to play mommy. What\'s going to happen once they realize their meal ticket AND validation is leaving? *Hopefully nothing*, but it\'s best to plan for the very worst, because telling men NO brings out their rage. And telling a man NO that is entitled enough to ""play woman"" on your dime is likely to be even worse. \n\nIn practical terms, this means planning quietly and making sure you have a safety plan in place. It may seem extreme, but if you can talk to a DV specialist about how to safely leave, you really should. It cannot hurt. \n\nDocument EVERYTHING, and save every single text, phone call, email, everything. Get an app that records everything off your device.

Your wife is lucky to have you, holding everything down. Tread carefully with therapy as many therapists are in the transcult and will fall for the pity parties and crocodile tears.

In some states, inherited wealth is included in community property; in other states, it's totally excluded. So depending on where you live, your spouse might not have a valid claim to/on your inheritance. A good lawyer can advise.\n\nAlso, there's no need to borrow money in order to consult a divorce or matrimonial lawyer. With top-flight matrimonial attorneys in the US, the first appointment & attendant advice is always free - & if it's not, the lawyer is probably an unethical shyster.  What's more, if you are coming into an inheritance in the foreseeable future, any decent divorce or matrimonial attorney will take you on (if you want) & bill you later.  They are accustomed to this.\n\nI feel for you & wish you & your kids all the best."", ""I can't imagine someone like this ever improving.

Idk what it is about this theme that makes it okay for some trans women to completely revert back to children. In this political climate we have today, they are cradled by an entire movement like babies; so much so that they forget that they are adults and that their feelings and needs do not come first in every aspect of life. I’d expect a child to think/feel/act this way because children are to be dependent and protected by society and the adults around them.

It sounds really difficult, and I hope you have the support you need. The end of a marriage is rough, no matter the circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me it sounds like your SO is using (abusing) being trans and your love and accommodation for her to act like a spoiled, self-centered brat. This is probably mostly caused by deep, pervasive insecurity on her part, but it sounds like the insecurity is taking over as she tries way too hard to achieve a probably unachievable/unrealistic view of what it means to be ""female."" It sounds like there\'s some significant maturing that she needs to do, which probably needs a lot more therapy. I would expect there\'s a lifetime of work on her part, and depending on her own personality, it could even be unachievable. Real, deep change is always a long and difficult process.\n\nMore importantly, it\'s not your responsibility to solve her problems. Her internal emotional/psychological struggles are her own. It sounds like you\'ve been supportive and tried, which IMO, is what a spouse should do. It\'s not a failing on your part if your SO has things that you can\'t resolve. Like you, I\'ve always had a deep seated view that marriage is forever, but I had my marriage end due to my SO\'s mental illness. Like you, I struggled for a while with feeling like a failure for ""giving up."" I was unsure of myself and didn\'t know if I was making the right decision. It took years to work through it--no matter the circumstances, or how right the decision, ending a marriage is a tragic experience. Even if it\'s right, it sucks. Looking back a decade later, there was nothing I could do to help my ex. Staying was hurting us both. It was important to me to feel like I really tried and didn\'t just give up on my marriage, but it was ultimately the right decision to end it. You may not really know if you\'re making the right decision, but you have to care for yourself.

That site is hilarious, BTW.\n\nIf anyone is curious why TIMs insist on entering womens sports even though everyone can see they have an unfair advantage, in order for a sex change to be 100% and never mentioned again legally, they need to be included as women for sporting events. TIMs being banned from female sporting events would mean their actual sex would always have to be a matter of record. So they will fight this one to the death. It's probably going to be one of the things that sink in the court of public opinion because it's obvious even to the average sports fan a TIM has an unfair advantage over women.\n\nYou'll also notice the article avoids the fact that recent research is showing they maintain male muscle strength even after T blockers, and TIMs are two SD large than females. Which means an average size TIM has at least a 2SD head start in terms of strength on plain old Jane. This means only about only about 1/40 women is as strong or stronger as the average TIM.\n\nEDIT: just realised a some of you won't know what 'SD' means. It's [standard deviation](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and it's referring to a distribution curve. The average man is 6 inches taller than the average woman. [Image to help you visualise what this means in terms of groups.](https://tall.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-height-distribution-with-legend.jpg) About one man in three is 6ft or over, and about 1% of women.\n\nI'm also linking an old /r/dataisbeautiful post showing [nearly all men are stronger than nearly all women, for grip strength and more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4vcxd0/almost_all_men_are_stronger_than_almost_all_women/)"", '>\tUSA Powerlifting has banned all transgender women from competing as women, even as a trans powerlifter in Minnesota recently won a state championship with another association, setting a state record.\n\n>\tJayCee Cooper, a trans woman, had applied last year to compete in a recent USA Powerlifting event in Minnesota. In December her application was denied.\n\n>\t“Male-to-female transgenders are not allowed to compete as females in our static strength sports as it is a direct competitive advantage,” wrote USAPL Therapeutic Use Exemptions Committee Chair Kristopher Hunt in an email to Cooper.\n\n>\tHunt followed up with Cooper in January with this explanation:\n\n>“Transgender male to female individuals having gone through male puberty confer an unfair competitive advantage over non-transgender females due to increased bone density and muscle mass from pubertal exposure to testosterone.”\n\n>\tThe “bone density” red herring has been thrown out there for years, at least since MMA fighter Fallon Fox appeared on the scene. The bone density of black women is, on average, significantly higher than that of white women.

The USPA is smaller and holds fewer events in Cooper’s home state. But she’s happy to be able to compete.\n\n\n>“They allow trans people to compete in their untested division,” Cooper said. “I won their Minnesota State Championship and it was amazing, but it still felt off knowing that I was denied eligibility for USA Powerlifting.”\n\n>\tIn the meantime, Cooper has not let go of her dream of competing in USA Powerlifting events.\n\n>“I am hopeful that the USAPL membership will stand up for trans inclusion and be on the right side of history.

axccwr,axccwr,Got removed as a moderator of TwoXChromosomes for agreeing with Sharron Davies' comments on transwomen in female sport.,"Title says it all, really. 

I was a mod for around 10-12 months, not exactly sure. I've been a Reddit user for a long time, and when TwoX advertised that they were looking for moderators, I decided to apply because I always liked that there was a place on Reddit for women to talk and share with each other.

Pretty quickly after becoming a mod, I noticed that a lot of viewpoints were suppressed within the community, despite it claiming to be for ""women's perspectives"" - the perspectives of *certain* women, sure. I saw many innocuous comments and posts arbitrarily removed, not because they broke any rules, but because they did not agree with the moderator's personal points of view, and I didn't feel like I really 'fit in' with it. I even noticed some of my own comments being removed by other moderators.

Truth be told, I'd been considering leaving ever since an AMA with Daniel(le) Muscato was featured on the sub. I stopped participating  as much after that, either posting or moderating, but I didn't leave. A couple of days ago, someone posted an article about swimmer Sharron Davies' comments on transgender male athletes competing with female athletes, and I made a comment stating that I agreed with Sharron. Of course I agree with her, anyone with an understanding of human physiology would, right?

I log into Reddit today to find I've been removed as a moderator for ""transphobic"" comments - for daring to agree with Sharron Davies about transgender athletes. I never insulted anyone, I did not use abusive language, and I don't hate transgender people - I've suffered from clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria myself! I simply acknowledged the biological advantages that males have over females, and stated that if biological males are allowed to compete against females then women's sport is basically finished. The world has truly gone crazy. 

Edit: ~~I've had a couple of PMs asking me to provide the comment I made, or suggesting I am lying about the content of what got me removed. This is false, but I do not have the comment to provide - it was removed by another moderator, and I deleted it after that happened (wasn't the first time I'd had one of my comments deleted). I didn't know when I hit delete that I'd need it to defend myself - if I had, I'd have screenshotted it.~~ A kind soul actually saved my exact words, and posted them in the TwoX thread. Using removeddit I was able to find it. Here is the [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gPyFR7T.png) of that comment, and here are the words I said:

> **I agree with her, too. It shouldn't be allowed. Allowing transwomen to compete in female sport will be the end for natal women who want to compete. You might as well get rid of sex segregated sport all together if you allow this, and just accept that no natal woman will win anything again.**


I ~~do, however,~~ also have an example that is very similar to the comment I made. [This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ontVazg.png) was taken from a thread about Rachel McKinnon, the trans cyclist who won the (female)  2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships.

aneh4l,aneh4l,My kids are adopted.,"About 2% of people are adopted meaning the vast majority of other mothers I interact with are not adoptive parents.

When a woman in my mom's groups asks, ""did any of you have postpartum hair loss?"" I don't shout, ""excuse me but not all of us gave birth! Therefore it's violent and exclusionary to talk about your birth experiences!""

I do not infiltrate mom groups and make it against the rules to discuss pregnancy, birth or the heritable traits they passed on to their children.

I do not need to be included in every human conversation. I am not the center of the universe. I understand that my experience is not the common one. When I wish to discuss it, I join a group of other adoptive parents and talk to them.

I love my kids with the same mama bear ferocity that biological mothers do but no matter how strong my feelings I am not now and never will be the biological mother of my children. I do not require society to participate in a fantasy in which I am. Even if I felt sad that I did not birth them I still would not push others to soothe me by pretending that I did.

Definition of parent: One that begets or brings forth offspring. I am not offended by this definition. I fulfill the social role of parent for my children but in most instances in both humans and animals alike, a mother is she who created her young. It is useful to have a word to describe female parents who birthed their young, because they are many, and they have unique needs (social, psychological, medical) and experiences.

My children and I probably share similar intestinal flora because we live together. My raising them has probably also affected their epigenetics and gene expressions. That still does not make us biological relatives. They do not have my DNA. I do not need to submit our samples to 23andme to prove it. 

I didn't birth but I profoundly care about the reproductive rights of my mother sisters, about accessible prenatal care and safe and humane childbirth practices across the world.

When each of my kids became legally mine, the state revised their birth certificates to put my name in place of their birth parents'. That still does not make me their biological mother. And many adoptees consider this practice to be offensive. A legal document cannot change their or my biological material reality.

I will love my children with every atom of my being until my last breath. I do not need to be biologically related to them to do so. It is ok for me to be something other than that. It is still beautiful, meaningful and, yes, our favorite word, valid.",1217,"[""\nWelcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

He wasnt always able to do what other kids were.  We spent months living in a hospital.  That doesnt mean people should tailor discussions about their children around what reality is for my child.  Other moms I know would feel guilty when talking about the routine aggravation in their kids lives (someone is being mean to them at school, etc) and then they would remember the hardships my child was facing.  I'd always tell them to please continue, the world doesnt revolve around me or my kid, whatever is going on in their life is important too.\n\nYou sound like a great mom, keep up the good work!"", 'I don\'t have kids at all. There are probably more of us than of you awesome adoptive parents, and yet I accept that most women have children and that parenting, school stuff, etc. are common topics of conversation online and in person. \n\nMost of the time I\'m interested in the subject when it comes up--I\'m an aunt and a taxpayer, these are people I know and I am just generally interested in their experiences--but if it does make my eyes glaze over, I find a way to politely drift away from the conversation. In fact, I feel bad about it when people apologize to me about ""rambling on"" (their words, not mine) about child-related stuff. I absolutely never demand that they make the conversation all about me and my interests.  In fact, that would make me feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\nOh, yeah, and I would never presume to know more about childrearing than seasoned parents (or new ones, for that matter).\n\nI think what you\'re describing above is typically  a *male* behavior. (Yes, some women, blah blah, but MOST MEN.) Not being the center of attention in any women\'s conversation or forum is utterly intolerable to them.  I used to be active in the comments of *Salon\'s* now-defunct column ""Broadsheet,"" and the first or second comment would always be ""What about the men?"" or ""Not all men!"" or the totally, absurdly irrelevant ""We need to legalize marijuana!"" (always posted by a man--because his subject matter, however unrelated to the topic at hand, should ALWAYS take precedence over whatever trivial things women are talking about, like reproductive rights or equal pay or domestic violence). \n\nSo it wouldn\'t surprise me at all if being the center of female attention was a primary, if unacknowledged or even unrecognized, factor in a lot of decisions to transition, now that women are bending over backwards to provide it.  In forums like the one I describe, women would at first try to placate and engage with male intruders, and then they\'d start to call them out or just ignore them, and eventually such comments would just be considered harassment or trolling and be removed altogether. We need to do this more often and in larger numbers, and when it occurs in real life, we need to smile politely, nod, and bring the conversation back on track.

cib07f,cib07f,Hey Contrapoints,"I know you're obsessed with this sub, so let it be known, it is because of you that I became a TERF. Before I came across your videos, I was your typical SJW liberal feminist. I had my doubts about trans people, about its misogynistic overtones, its illogical inconsistencies, its high risk-factors, its huge overlaps with the kink/bdsm worlds. But none of it made me peak. I trusted the trans activists I followed online. I ""submitted"" to them, as a ""privileged"" ""cis"" women should.

I didn't peak until I saw your videos and got a strong negative feeling I had never felt before. I saw right through you, and in that moment it all clicked. When I watched your gender critical video in a university classroom, and no one in the room had any questions or discussion points to make after it ended--odd for a philosophy class--red alarm bells started ringing. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I went with my gut and googled more about the gender critical movement, which I had never heard of before. I found that all my doubts that I had hushed through incessant group think were finally being responded to. I realized they were right. I also found out about your MRA past, your old rapey videos. I saw through your brand of champagne socialism. Unlike you, I was raised working class from a third world country and a real woman. You don't speak for me, or my sister, my mother, and my grandmother, or any of my female ancestors who have actually fought for the protection of women against all kinds of exploitation. And you never will. You are the oppressor you love to perform to hate.

I was led here. Thanks to you.

And I'm sure I'm not the only person you've peaked. I'm sure there are thousands of us, too afraid to say anything, but with ears and eyes open wide. And every time you make a video, or post a disgustingly sexist tweet, you peak more and more people. Just remember that.

Proud TERF

He was born into a wealthy family, he had an education that allowed him to posture and pretend he’s intelligent, but Nick doesn’t have any actual ideas of his own. \n\nHe may be an empty husk of a man, but he is smart enough to understand, deep down, how much of a fraud he is. \n\nThat’s why he’s still so unhappy even with all the attention and praise he receives. That’s why going on r/gendercritical “makes him cry”. It’s not because some women use the t slur and talk about his huge man hands (which by the way are huge indeed Nick you don’t pass), it’s because the women on here see straight through him. \n\nThat’s what kills him, it is the refusal to submit to his fantasy that he is a Natalie Portmanesque waif of a genius, and not an aging, porn addicted, botched, talentless, mediocre man who tried to turn into his sex fantasy but wont be able to keep up the facade much longer :)', '> And I\'m sure I\'m not the only person you\'ve peaked. \n\nYou\'re right.

No? Well I guess you probably also ignore the stopclymer hashtag too even though it began before he transitioned... I\'m seeing a pattern.*', ""The moment that made me peak trans was when I watched the part of Contra's Gender Critical video where he mocked the idea about abolishing gender. That's when I wanted to find out what you were all about."", 'I used to follow him in the heyday of the YouTube atheist community when he had a few thousand subscribers. I remember the porn livestreams, his naive sexism, his pretentious aloofness, and that footage of him at an atheist meet-up where he got ridiculously drunk and had to be babysat by his friends, one of whom I think was his girlfriend for a while (a much more popular video maker at the time). He seemed socially awkward and a little bit sad. He disappeared, as did most of the rest of that community. \n\nWhen he came back as Contra, he made a couple of interesting videos and I wasn’t at all surprised that he was still a vainglorious aesthete but at least a little more sophisticated than before. Now the cultured pretty boy has truly come into his own. He’s the perfect face for the trans movement - he’s shallow, cynical, superficially charming and clever enough to fool stupid people into thinking he’s a genius. Thanks to the generosity of his followers, he can finally afford to be the libertine he aspired to be when he was twenty. But he’s still a sad, now rapidly ageing, nerd who has peaked in popularity. I don’t think his story will end well. I don’t wish ill on him, but he’s a woman-hating prick so I don’t wish him good, either. I think self-destruction is part of his ultimate goal, and will be curated beautifully, I’m sure.', ""Is it just me or is CP being credited for de-radicalizing the boys from the alt-right?

Also, how typical of a man to mock menstruation. Is period shaming on the woke agenda now too?', ""Be sure to check out Terri Strange's youtube channel.

I haven\'t watched it in a while, but the videos on GC and Blanchard stuff have some glaring blind spots. In the Autogynephilia one, Contra focuses a lot on how bad/weird the writing is in ""The Man Who Would Be Queen"" rather than showing that Blanchard is unequivocally wrong.

I really liked Contrapoints. I still think that the Alpha Males and Incels videos are excellent; I've showed those to multiple friends. But now it seems that every video lately involves more navel-gazing and obsession with very narrow issues. The last four videos are all mostly related to trans content and the particular issues with which Contra is struggling in the moment. Before, Contra talked about racism, fascism, cultural appropriation, toxic masculinity, things which impact people on a much larger scale. And now it's just stuff like ... plastic surgery? Pronouns? And angry feminists who hate trans people? And the conclusions are so wrong, or based on such incorrect assumptions, that it then makes me question the content of every other video which I previously liked."", 'I really loved Contrapoints’ video about incels and found some fascinating insights there.\n\nContrapoints’ video on Gender Critical was really bad and neglected to address the issues that made me GC; like cotton ceiling rhetoric, trans women in women’s sports, and trans bullying of women who have the audacity to refer to their own reproductive anatomy  ( the bullying of women who wear pussy hats to the women’s march is what peaked me)\n\nAs a side note Contra acted out a TERF character in the GC video who was like a Wiccan earth goddess rad fem and I honestly started liking and identifying more with the parody character than Contra .', 'Thanks for posting this. You totally rock!!!!', 'I also found the GC movement when she mentioned this subreddit in her vid. I checked it bc I was curious and went back to it frequently, until I fully peaked. But I was subbed to nat for ages and I loved her vids so my admiration for her and my radical feminism have always sorta clashed. I envisioned they would just exist separately until I rewatched Gender Critical. And I just didn’t agree with her logic. \nAnyway I still think in “her” pronouns but I doubt that’s going to continue for a lot longer, I’m seeing a really narcissistic entitlement from her that you only ever see in men...

What happened to steelmanning? Jordan Peterson, incels, the alt-right, even the fucking golden one got a fairer shake than transmeds and and rad fems in your most recent videos. \n\nOne specific example: In Transtrenders, Tiffany Tumbles says that she's trans because she has a gender dysphoria dx. The counter (contra?) argument? Gender dysphoria wasn't recognized until 2013! Ha! Except, (1) that's not how medical diagnoses work and even if it was, (2) gender dysphoria was just called gender identity disorder before then. That's just one of many. Are arguments that shitty supposed to actually convince anyone? I thought you were better than that. The quality and strength of your arguments has dropped.

My other gender-fluid friend is more gender conforming than me when she wants to be and overall probably is, though she can be very GNC when she wants to be. Neither of them could be targeted because they're both still obviously female and if anything, if you think they could be because they're trans/NB then that would imply that myself other GNC people could be targeted for 'appearing trans'.

Vilain helped write the NCAA’s rule for transgender participation. Under those rules, transgender women must undergo one year of testosterone suppression therapy before being allowed to compete. Vilain referenced studies that showed that a year of testosterone suppression significantly dropped the muscle mass in adult males.  \n>  \n>Vilain told me that the NCAA’s rules were also aimed at inclusivity and that the governing body aims to give everyone the chance to compete. Creating rules around transgender participation, he admitted, was extremely challenging. He said that the entire concept of anatomical equality for transgender athletes was simply not feasible, and thus, it was not a stated goal of the NCAA’s rules.  \n>  \n>“It is not about making everybody biologically equal, and I think that is a common misconception when we start talking about transgender athletes,” he said. “People want transgender ~~\\[females\\]~~ \\[""women""\\] to be physiologically identical to ~~\\[born\\]~~ females, and if they’re not, it’s unfair. That is not possible.”  \n>  \n>Dr. Vilain referenced the structure of the pelvis and the mass of certain muscle groups as anatomical differences between the male and female body that will always be somewhat different. But achieving total equality is not the point, Dr. Vilain said. The purpose of the NCAA’s rules is to, in a sense, shift the transgender female athlete’s muscle mass and physiology away from that of the average male. The goal is to create a pathway to include the transgender athlete, not create total equality.  \n>  \n>**“Can you turn a man’s body into a woman’s body?

bzruto,bzruto,[Rant] I'm sick of the myth that society allows women to freely express emotions while men cannot,"In what fucking universe?  How many times were you told to stop overreacting or to ""just ignore him"".  

""It's easier for us to moderate your reaction than to prevent his behavior...""  Do you have brothers?  How many times did you get in trouble for crying or making a fuss and ""getting him in trouble"" because he hit you or took something from you?  My brother beat the ever living shit out of me regularly.  I had welts and bruises.  Black eyes.  If they couldn't dismiss the severity of the injury, the question became what I did to provoke.  Sometimes my crime was trying to play in the same room.  I should know better.

How many times did you get criticized for being too sensitive or overreacting or being hysterical because you stood up for yourself?  When you father made a cruel joke about how if you kept eating like that you'd end up as fat as your mother... When your father joked about fat or ugly women you saw out in public?  When you suffered from disordered eating or low self-esteem and you asked that he no longer comment on your eating habits because you were starting to really struggle.  When you spent days picking out the right words and the right tone and the right environment to ask someone who supposedly loved you to stop hurting you...

How many of you were taught to be agreeable and accommodating to the extent that you were exploited or abused by men in your life?  Boyfriends who trampled your sexual boundaries.  What exactly constitutes a rape?  You wanted to make him happy.  You wanted him to stop being angry.  Isn't that the same as consent?  

How many times were you made responsible for managing the emotions of men?  Not to mention playing nursemaid, nanny, secretary and therapist for friends and boyfriends and co-workers...

In what fucking universe are men's emotions not the center of every fucking conversation?  When you can't call your husband out for not doing the fucking dishes again despite repeatedly begging him to lighten your burden.  When you have to mollycoddle his feelings, even when he's trampling on yours with constant, blatant disregard or disrespect?

When the media is filled with glorified men and maleness.  When the women ground into the dirt by these great men's heels are an acceptable exchange for their greatness.  Domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual assault, emotional abuse, misogyny... None of these tarnish the inherent greatness of a great man if he's worthy enough.  ""He's under a lot of stress.""

When your body is a battleground for men's expectations and comfort.  When your hair, your skin, your clothes become an obstacle course for men's eyes.  Shave, hide your menstrual pads, dress modestly lest your presence make men feel unwelcome in your vicinity.

Men's emotions under the guise of ""logic and reason"" wherein voices are raised and language gets increasingly abusive when you disagree.  

If men want to foster positive masculinity, they're welcome to do so.  But I've spent enough of my life trying to coax, charm and coerce men into showing some fucking decency.  I will no longer have empathy for a man who doesn't return my empathy with interest.",998,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

It’s bullshit because women get punished for speaking up.

I decided I had enough and went to recovery. I’m recovered now for about eight months, my longest streak in 14 years.\n\nThis has caused a complex that has followed me to today — my problems don’t matter as much as anyone else’s. I need to shut up about my problems. I shut up when I’m in pain. I refuse help constantly, especially from my mom.

agq3v6,agq3v6,I’m a gendercritical doctor and here is why I don’t prescribe HRT to MtFs.,"I’m a gendercritical physician in a liberal part of Germany. Here is why I don’t prescribe HRT for MtFs: 

While HRT is not dangerous at doses used to relieve symptoms in menopausal women, HRT in higher doses can and will cause health symptoms after a while.

Natural estrogen levels for women fluctuate depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle.
Yet MtFs bully physicians into keeping their Estradiol levels at a constant 200 to 300 pg/ml at all times. This is simply not realistic.
A woman her Estradiol levels are perfectly fine at 50 pg/ml too.
Most days of the month a woman’s Estradiol levels will not be at or around 200 pg/ml. These people are not mimicking a woman’s hormone system, they are inventing their own rules for endocrinology and they bully physicians into following their wishes. All their hormone treatment regimens are based on hearsay, not on factual research. 
They are obsessed with Estradiol only, while a healthy woman has a mix of Estrone, Estriol and Estradiol. You can’t just pick and choose whichever you want in your body and which not, a healthy woman has all 3 of these. Yet MtFs tell each other that they should only aim for as much Estradiol as possible and dismiss Estriol and Estrone as ineffective. Estriol is one of the most wellness guaranteed hormones in a woman’s body. Estriol gives you that beautiful rosy glow when you are pregnant and expecting soon. 
Estriol is a protective hormone. It ties off the effects of Estradiol and Estrone when these latter two are present in too high concentrations in a woman’s body. They supplement estrogenic activity when too little of Estradiol and Estrone is present, like during pregnancy when Estriol is the most abundant hormone, produced by the placenta together with Estetrol. 
These people tell each other to use massive doses of an anti androgen that was intended for use in prostate cancer patients and has hepatoxic side effects (Bicalutamide). They tell each other that less testosterone is better, often driving their testosterone levels under immeasurable amounts. Zero testosterone doesn’t make you feminine. It makes you chronically fatigued, prone to obesity, it makes your muscles atrophy, it makes your hair prone to fall out and it makes for retardation in basic brain functions.
These people tell each other to use progesterone rectally on a daily basis. What they don’t realise is that women have the same progesterone levels as men, except for 1 week a month when progesterone levels peak heavily.
They are not hormonally female. They are their own hormonal invention.

And physicians just keep prescribing. Scared to be politically incorrect.

I’m a physician who went into this branch to improve people’s lives.
I’m not going to prescribe a genetic male massive doses of hormones that are supranatural even for a genetic female’s body.

It’s never enough for these people. Their way or the highway.
And they are only harming themselves with it longterm.

How can any woman here parrot that shit? That a man can ""live as a woman"" or say he isn\'t hurting anyone and since he dresses femininely ""I see him as a woman and thus use female pronouns for him, it\'s not hurting anyone."" Bullshit, it DOES hurt people, specifically women. It hurts women and girls because it still pushes a postmodernist idea that being a female human being is not a material, biological reality but instead some costume one can wear. That does have an effect on how women are then treated in society, whether through the legal system or in personal relations. It says that the experiences of physical and sexual violence girls and women face is our own fault for not adhering to the patriarchal code, or that we could just identify out of our oppression. And it\'s so obvious since it\'s always MEN that these people let claim whatever they want. I mean come the fuck on.

This is no different.', 'I know exactly why I found this sub and why I like to lurk.  The redefinition of the sexes, that a male can be a female.\n\nThis language aberration in Trans Rights Activism is becoming legal dictum (Colorado just allowed people to more easily change their sex on State-issued documentation). Legal dictum regulates bodily rights and autonomy in a free society, is medicalized, precedent-based and evidence-based, and has descriptive historic value. This is how laws are made and people are categorized as subjects by the State, which includes practices of demography that the State undertakes for the purpose of monitoring services and resource use among populations as well as spatial dispersion of peoples. Legally conflating the bodily autonomy needs of females, the reproductive costs and accompanying necessary legal rights of females, or the accommodation needs of females with those of males is simply a bad idea (basically, don\'t waste resources putting tampons and pads in the boys bathroom just because it\'s fashionable to decree ""boys can have periods"" when girls really do need those resources). Differently sexed bodies do have differently sexed needs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst wave feminism fought the good fight, which took place around obstetrics and gynecology, sex-based rights (voting included), and issues of public accommodation for females (like school, work and public health). Not all of their fights were very visible during that time. But, they helped the most. How? By defining the needs of female persons and arranging public institutions so that female persons are accommodated justly. It took a lot of work to convince males to recognize that females need specific things. At one point in medicine, female bodies were thought to just be smaller male bodies, fetuses were also homunculi, and hyster the uterus ran all around females\' thoracic cavities resulting in psychological maladies, which we know now is not true when it comes to healthcare. Sexed-based healthcare needs persist after all medicalized transition is undertaken by transgender people. Transgender males/transmen/TiFs will still always and forever need gynecologists and obstetricians when it comes to reproductive healthcare needs, and conversely transgender females/transwomen/TiMs will always be referred to urologists for their reproductive healthcare needs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale sexed bodies cannot become male sexed bodies. This should remain a fact in legal dictum because it affects people\'s lived experiences. It might, because definitions are discrete by nature, necessitate coming up with another word to describe what a potential ovum producing human body vis-a-vis a potential sperm producing human body is which would be completely a waste of time. Has Oxford changed the definition of female yet to include males?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not lacking in compassion. Yes, trans people say ""we didn\'t choose to be trans"", but no one at any point chose to be female, male or even alive. No human has a choice in this matter. They are separating themselves based on perceived birth-based disadvantage without understanding that we all are in fact the same in this regard because no one chose to be born.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I get back to the U.S. who knows when (and I can\'t wait to do this), to whichever state I end up in because by then these self-identify laws will be everywhere, I am going to get all male identification without physically modifying or socially modifying anything about myself or even changing my name,  because these documents will have historic and comedic value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould you imagine a sovereign state, the largest empire ever, having a population that is 80% male, hell, 100% male? It will be technically possible for every female in the U.S. (or Australia, Canada, Britain, etc.) to get male identification without having to make any changes to themselves, therefore making the entire empire male. That\'s preposterous. But, it\'d be one hell of a protest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate this sub for the resources, specifically showing the history of this push, sharing of the prescient book *The Transsexual Empire*, even the mentioning of the documentary titled *Trans Kids: It\'s Time to Talk* (which is not available online anywhere that I can fine; most reviews are disapproving), and the continued amounts of stories about females\' legal rights around the world. These stories are not easily sourced anywhere else that I know of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEunuchs are becoming popularized by different names. Currently, children are being foreground in this movement which has ignited the changes in legal definition, basically suggesting to kids that if you were born female you can actually become male or vice versa. It\'s lying to a child and submitting that child to become a eunuch (see Nicholas/Nicole/Jazz Jennings). The leap forward in centering children, minors, preschoolers and toddlers as people who, pre-sexual maturation and often in its absence meaning they lack complete knowledge of their sexed bodies, are legally written as the opposite sex when treatments actually turn these kids into eunuchs is disingenuous. We should, at the very least, explain to the minors involved in this that they are technically not able to become the opposite sex and by compromising their sexual maturation and sexual integrity they will only become eunuchs. Not only that but becoming a eunuch supported by trans medical treatments is a lifelong, chronic health disorder which requires persistent medical care and oversight. It would be unethical to lie to people. Every historical incidence of mass sterilization has been retrospectively dubbed inhumane, yet we\'re doing it again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR This sub is actually giving me some sense of connection to home since I\'m currently outside the U.S. and the West.

I just peeked over at their post and the vast majority of comments have been deleted. \n\nLook, I\'m talking to lurkers, here: everything that so-called ""TERFs"" and ""SWERFs"" stand for is representative of **all pre-Tumblr feminism.** We\'re talking the feminism that won women the right to vote, that allowed women to own property, to have credit cards, to work, to work without sexual harassment, to have reproductive healthcare. **ALL OF IT**. If anyone cracked open any of the feminist literature published before 2007, they would immediately be struck by how ""terfy"" it would be deemed by this present-day dumpsterfire of ""woke"" discourse. Do you know why? Because in order to advocate for women\'s rights, you have to be able to know what a fucking woman is. Sexist oppression is rooted in material fact. **Every ounce of feminist scholarship, thought, and activism repudiates the notion of ""cis"", because feminists acknowledge** **gendered expectations and roles as the tools by which which sexism is enforced under patriarchy.** That\'s the crux of the entire feminist project -- **to reject gendered expectations and roles,** and to advocate for a world in which men and women are no longer subject to any kind of gendered expectations.\n\nTrans ideology, on the other hand, **affirms** **gender to a frightening degree**: to them, if biological sex isn\'t in alignment with gendered expectations, then they advocate for lifelong medicalization (which results in sterilization) and invasive surgery. Let me say that again: trans activism advocates for the sterilization and mutilation of healthy people, especially children, for not adhering to gendered expectations according to sex.\n\nTrans inclusive feminism is a misnomer. It is an ahistorical, homophobic, misogynistic and very often racist enterprise (I cannot count how many times I\'ve read ""woke"" comparisons between men in dresses and black women) that completely subverts women\'s liberation. They may paint themselves as the next ""wave"" of feminism, but in actuality they are a male trojan horse. With lipstick. They affirm gender roles, they medicalize gender nonconformity, they center males, they advocate for male athletes to compete against female athletes, they publicly shame lesbians for their sexual orientation, they denigrate and silence women who dare to speak about the female body/condition/reality, they advocate for male rapists and pedophiles who identify as women to be housed in women\'s shelters and prisons, and they suppress news stories of male rapists and pedophiles who harass women and girls in intimate spaces (for God\'s sake LOOK THIS UP.)\n\nIf you\'ve ever wondered why you hear more about trans women in the media more than trans men, it\'s because trans women are men and the fact that they take up space and talk over women doesn\'t stop despite self identification. Sex is immutable. Men who dress like women and claim to be us are worse than other types of men. It is the ultimate form to sexual entitlement and domination. Compare this to someone like RuPaul, who never claims to be a woman, and who is reviled by the transgender community because he rejects gendered expectations while still embracing his biological sex. If RuPaul was a drag king, she never would have had a popular TV show and would probably be inundated with rape threats for her ""TERFy"" commentary. Sexism is fucking WILD.\n\nTL:DR - read actual feminist books, any of them, written before 2007, and brush up on what it actually took to get anything accomplished for women in the past 250 years. It\'s all ""TERFy"", aka, real, actual feminism that understands womanhood as rooted in material reality, not a feeling that a man with a panties fetish has.', 'welcome to twoXchromosomes, where if you have 2 X chromosomes, you better shut the fuck up, b*tch!', 'Love this sub.

Tinxi / Shutterstock.com*\n\n  \nTRIESTE, Italy, July 23, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) — The regional council of Friuli Venezia Giulia, an autonomous region in northeastern Italy, approved a motion calling on the national government to prohibit so-called puberty-blocking drugs used in so-called reassignment treatment for gender-confused children.\n\n\nIn a July 17 move by a center-right majority led by the League party, the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional council approved a motion calling on Italy’s national government to prohibit the prescription of drugs that prevent normal sexual development of adolescents.\n\n\nThe League’s leader is Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is one of the three members in Italy’s coalition government that includes Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Party (M5S) and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The leftist parties in the regional council, including M5S, voted against the motion.\n\n\nAccording to the council’s motion, “puberty is not a disease” and thus should not be prevented with surgery and medications that can produce irreversible effects. It also noted the long-term negative effects of drugs containing triptorelin.\n\n\n> ""There is no evidence, in fact,” reads the motion, “on the effective full restoration of fertility in the case of withdrawal from treatment.” \n\nIt cites data [circulated by the American College of Pediatricians](http://archive.is/0jutd), which stated that as many as 98% of minors will outgrow their gender dysphoria (a feeling that one’s biological sex does not accord with one’s gender expression) after having passed through puberty naturally.\n\n\n> ""We express opposition to the use of this drug,” \n\nsaid Mauro Bordin, according to [VoceControCorrente](https://vocecontrocorrente.it/stop-al-farmaco-blocca-puberta-il-friuli-dice-no-alla-triptorelina/?fbclid=IwAR2_c-JxIPDowZEiaSdp89JVbnBPt3pPqTV8CpNh0SQR7lmU-IMt2MOPbnY). Bordin, who represents the League on the council and was a signatory of the motion, went on to say there are not enough clinical studies, \n\n> ""especially regarding the possible long-term negative effects and why blocking puberty pharmacologically could cause a misalignment in [adolescent] physical and cognitive development.” \n\n\nHe said puberty-blockers could even compromise those parts of the brain that contribute to the definition of sexual identity, which also involve both environmental and educational factors.\n\n\nBordin said the motion is not an \n\n> ""ideological position, but a proposal of common sense in the exclusive interest of the health of children throughout Italy.” \n\n\nCritics have long warned against medical interventions for persons experiencing gender dysphoria.

brwve7,brwve7,I refused to wear the sticker this week,"(edited below) I started a new job recently at a major university. I knew what I was in for but the department I am in is hard sciences, not humanities and I needed to be away from my previous job.

We had orientation and it was to cover everything from computer security to social issues. in reality it was, out of the 3 hours, over an hour on pronouns and the cult speak leading up to the pronouns discussion. 

when we came in we were given a big blank sticker and a sharpie to write our name and pronouns on and put on our chests. I put my sticker, unmarked and unpeeled on my desk and handed my sharpie down the line. 

we were then paired up to get to know each other to introduce to the rest of the people in orientation. the first question was 'name, pronouns'. I gave my name and barreled through the rest of the questions. when she introduced me to the class she apologized for not having gotten my pronouns and I said that was ok, i hadn't given them. 

the person giving the orientation said, that's alright, you can just give them now. and I said no thank you. no apologies, no reason, no way to push the issue without really pushing. so, she pushed 'it's ok, it's easy to miss things, you can do it now'. and again, no, thank you. I don't do that '

so I got to sit there for the next 2 hours, the only person in the room without a sticker on and no one knowing what to call me (although, somehow, they all decided on' she/her') /s.

it was completely uneventful except for the initial shock on everyone's faces but it was a conscious decision on my part and I wanted to share because it's not like I can tell anyone in real life about it and have them understand my teensy rebellion.

I have to say, out of a 3 hour mandatory orientation to cover so many topics I found it offensive that a third of it was spent on pronouns. maybe 5 minutes at the end about race and nothing about disabilities.

edits: WOW! I was just looking to have a little celebretory post, i thought it likely i would be talking to myself. I had no idea this would resonate so hard with so many! thank you for the support, gold anwoo-hoos!

being that i didnt think it would be a traction post i didnt put in much detail. I was prepared to have a few additional pushes and responses, some of which I picked up here (I dont care how people feel the need to refer to me, etc), the main thing was making sure it was clear that i was not complying, not that I was confused or shy.

I also feel some responsibility to do this because I am extremely visually gender conforming (I couldnt be more gender conforming if I were Dolly Parton or Brit Brit) . I dont think it should always fall to the gnc women.

I am a bit disappointed in myself because there were 2 absolutely perfect additional moments to comment. 1 was when it was compared to religion, i bit my tongue not saying, 'like scientology or a cult?' and another was when it was masculine and feminine traits and feelings being discussed, I really wanted to say ""so, a personality? because surely you are not saying a woman cant aspire to be strong, independent and outspoken without being called a male?"" may be next time. building muscles, small reps :)",852,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

csilz6,csilz6,A minor pronoun victory in an uber woke city,"At a woman's business meeting in an uber woke city we are asked to introduce ourselves, our business and state our pronouns. 

The pronoun thing is new, and the facilitator is very earnest about it. 

20 women in the room and a visiting male guest speaker, invited to share his niche technical expertise. 

I am in a huge quandary about what to do, I don't want to bow to the pronoun social engineering, but don't want to get caught up in drama or jeopardize my professional reputation. 

Facilitator starts, and enthusiastically does the pronouns thing. 

Guest speaker man goes next, introduces himself with everything *except* the pronouns. 

*Shocked Pikachu face*

I tentatively don't read too much into it, he's a senior guy, he speaks alot, so I assume he's doing his standard intro, has forgotten the pronoun instruction, and that the facilitator hasn't pulled him up because he's a guest.

I'm wondering if I can use this tactic when it's my turn or if I'll get told off. 

Next woman goes - she also skips the pronouns! 

And then the next starts her intro before the facilitator can jump in with a pronoun reminder! And she skips the pronouns too! 

and the next, and the next, and the next... 

until we've all done our introductions and we've all ignored the pronoun stuff! All 20 of us. 

Honestly, I nearly burst out laughing I was so exhilarated. 

Yes it took a man doing it, and yes it was the mildest of passive aggressive rebellious acts, but it made me realize that so many people are going along with this nonsense for a quiet life but secretly think it's ridiculous.

ar9dss,ar9dss,I am a psychiatrist and I am INFURIATED that I am not allowed to treat people suffering from gender dysphoria.,"For gender dysphoria, politics have overthrown medical science when it comes to treatment. Hormone replacement therapy and sexual reassignment surgery, when examined through exhaustive meta-analysis, fail to demonstrate  strong evidence of efficacy in alleviating the core behavioral distress of the condition.

Or to put it another way: Genital mutilation does not work for a psychiatric disorder. As providers we should be doing all we can to heal both the body and the mind. We are supposed to be guides to help the sick. But our duty has been hijacked and supplanted by political ideology.

Now that this travesty of medicine is the standard of care, we cannot even make progress in formulating treatments for gender dysphoria - for to treat it like the psychiatric malady it is, is to invite accusations of bigotry. 

In medicine, a delusion is a belief which is obviously at contradiction with reality. We see this most heavily in schizophrenia and sometimes severe OCD. In both cases it is extremely counter intuitive and harmful to tell the patient their delusional belief is valid and true. Yet in gender dysphoria this is what we are supposed to do as a society: Yes, your delusion is absolutely true, you are a beautiful woman and we will mutilate you and give you hormones when you are a small child.

God forbid I try and ever express my beliefs to my colleagues. Perhaps many share my own misgivings. But I cannot risk it. And so through inaction I am an accomplice - a breaker of my own Hippocratic oath - sacrificed on the altar of political correctness.

Fuck.

I can\'t imagine what it must be like to witness this trend from inside the profession. I do see it from the other side though, and it is deeply damaging.\n\nOur son, then 28, came to believe he was trans; despite having a diagnosis of adolescent onset schizoaffective disorder (with insidious onset, a prodrome of about a year and a half and problems since birth) his therapist not only affirmed his statement, she requested he keep this a secret until she could meet with myself and his dad and him in a therapy session. I had already guessed what this ""special session"" was to be about. His dad and I are his primary caretakers, as he is not able to function independently and, though bright is in most ways maybe 13 years maturation wise. How is it responsible for a trained therapist to encourage a mentally ill low functioning person with a suicide risk to keep secrets from his caretakers ??? This alone had me livid !\n\nFurther, I later asked the therapist what allowance she made for the symptoms of his condition in session, as I came to know she was actually affirming his delusions ! We discussed what he had said on some matters - events I had actually witnessed - and his reports were inaccurate but understandable re: his diagnosis (the schizophrenia aspect of his diagnosis has always been the most prominent). She responded she hadn\'t looked at his diagnosis as she liked to know her clients aside from their dx. She put him, and our family through over a year of hell, including physical attacks and hours spent searching the streets for him, all because she accepted his reports absent knowledge of his diagnosis, thus he thought his violent responses were in some way reasonable. Then to add the keeping secrets plus the trans issue -- I can\'t express how deeply irresponsible her behavior was. \n\nHe has since changed his view on his trans ness - a view I can trace the roots of, and understand how he would come to believe this (for one, when the world doesn\'t make sense, and people treat you differently because your MI causes social disconnect, how much easier one might think it is to have being trans as an explanation). If a therapist, with over a decade of experience as a psych nurse before becoming a therapist can be this irresponsible, I have no problem believing other therapists are just as damaging.\n\nThis must be so deeply frustrating for you; we at least had a good outcome (I removed him from his therapists\' care, and he doesn\'t have another yet; we work with him). You still swim in this polluted river. Best to you in all this; and what a relief to know there are people in the profession who actually \'get\' what a problem this is.', 'Even if - *if*- the best way to treat these delusions were to indulge them, what really gets me is why does it fall on the rest of society to indulge them as well?

cm27z9,cm27z9,“Karen” is yet another technique to keep women in their place.,"I know that this has been addressed on here before but I just saw a recent post on AITA that has, yet again, reinforced this belief.

She stood her ground and refused to pay for the work but was later told that she was being a “Karen” by one of her friends. 

Had any man done the same, his actions would have not been questioned in the least.

cu0lya,cu0lya,Transactivism ruined an on campus protest by Planned Parenthood today and I am exhausted,"I am getting my masters in social work as is a friend and classmate of mine. You have to do a practicum at an agency in order to get your degree and my friend is doing hers at Planned Parenthood. I helped her with a protest on campus today talking about reproductive rights (we are in the deep south so we were expecting a lot of push back regardless). A lot of women came to help the protest with signs they had made on their own. My friend led a chant of ""no uterus no opinion"" and the protest ended well with little push back from the university. Later her supervisor came to her and said the local LGBTQ organization on campus had contacted Planned Parenthood and wanted to end their partnership because of the ""trans slurs and transphobic comments"" at the protest. She was shocked and asked what they were referring to and it came out that they were offended by the ""gendered language"" used. Now, of course, it's become a big thing with them and naturally reproductive rights for women are being pushed to the back again in favor of coddling men's need to be at the center of everything. 

My friend has to now sit down with her practicum supervisor and a delegate from the LGBTQ group. She's concerned about this affecting her ability to graduate and how it will come back on her now that apparently they've rallied the entire group against Planned Parenthood.

At these events you see women of all ages, races, sexual orientations, and even representing a wider political spectrum than you’d probably expect. There are women who never have or never well needed an abortion, infertile women, women who have had hysterectomies, etc. These women all have one thing in common: their biology.\n\nGenderists are pushing so hard to make womanhood simply a matter of behavior—fashion, mannerisms, tastes.

c1eh1k,c1eh1k,I asked the trans community abt my trans rapist and they told me to fuck off and respect pronouns- my story,"Wow, ok I wanna say thank you for all the people supporting me through this. 

I guess for those of you seeing this with no context, someone posted an anonymous question I posted to the asktransgender subreddit about how I struggle with respecting the pronouns of a trans woman who raped me in high school on this sub and it's blowing up.

I don't know how long the original post will be up on asktransgender. Seems like they're removing the bad comments that have been there for months now that they're getting criticism, so I guess I'll just post this here for backup with some updates to the story.

When I was in high school I was caught up in an extremely toxic, controlling ""friendship"" with this guy. Let's call him Arthur. Arthur was very popular in the school among popular crowds. This was the early 2010s, when people were starting to get ""woke"" but in an ""omg I love having a sassy gay best friend"" kind of way and not a true support of all LGBT people kind of way. 

This is a short way to say that the GSA at my school was crawling with straight girls clamoring for the drama of those ""fun sassy gay men."" The few lesbians or bisexual women in the GSA were barely given a chance to speak. There were no out trans people in the GSA. 

A lot of the times it was gay men sharing how they felt or straight people giving their out-of-place opinions or asking rude questions. Arthur was very popular for his ""sassy"" comments. He was witty, snarky, and cast as a lead or lead supporting role in every school play. 

I don't know how I managed to ""befriend"" Arthur. Maybe it was because he was into the same nerdy things as 14 year old me was. Maybe he was using me from the start. At the time I was out in the GSA crowd as a lesbian (now I ID as bi, but with a very strong leaning towards women) and didn't talk much. I mostly sketched in the corner. 

Arthur was a narcissist. He was very self centered and saw himself as this kind of... untouchable entity I guess? Everybody loved this guy. We went to a very earthy crunchy private school where outright homophobia like slurs and attacks weren't really a thing (or if they were I never saw them) and the faculty was very coddling to him. His family was very catholic and when he came out as liking both men and women it... wasn't pretty.

When I think about this, I'm kind of realizing these events line up. His home life got harder, and our relationship shifted. He started coming on to me. Saying he was interested in me. I told him I wasn't interested in men. So he started using me for other things. 

I was and still am a very crafty person. I liked to write, to bake and to draw. I liked to do makeup. He would make me bring him baked goods. Make me write stories for his characters. Make me draw him or his characters in dresses he liked. Make me bring my expensive makeup to get togethers to get him dolled up. If I didn't, he'd spread rumors. 

My reputation would crumble bit by bit every time I didn't do what he wanted. He'd tell people I did or said horrible things. The only friends I had were in that schools GSA, really, and they all LOVED him. 

If I didn't do what he wanted, he'd suggest to my friends they eat lunch at some other part of the (large) school grounds. I'd wander around looking for my friends only to not find them and eat alone. He'd always play this off as him needing ""space"" because I was being ""difficult."" 

If I went too long without giving him something, he'd suicide bait me. Send me messages saying ""awfully nice weather above the [local large bridge people jump from]"" at best and ""why don't you just go off yourself right now if you're gonna be a cunt like this"" at worst. He would put awful things about me on social media in the form of vague posts.

All this over me not bringing him cookies or not writing him a fucking fanfiction because I had SCHOOLWORK that I was ALREADY FAILING due to stress. I became a regular at the school nurses, feigning illness to try and get home. I started hurting myself. It was awful.

This culminated in a sleepover I and a few other people had with him, where the assault happened. He didn't... finish, to put it in a less disgusting way, but I tried everything. I told him no. I said to stop. He held me in place and laughed it off. And he didn't stop until I guess he just figured it wasn't worth it to finish himself off.

I didn't tell anyone. It happened in my own home. Under my own roof. I was so caught up in feeling special at having a ""friend"" who was so well liked that I ignored everything else. Blamed myself. Until that.

I took everything BUT the assault to school authorities. I was too ashamed. They entirely excused his actions, including the suicide baiting. They said because he was bi and out of the closet with a catholic family I had to understand he's probably lashing out. It was also a super earthy crunchy place, again, so they reiterated that they didn't believe in conflict and wanted us to work it out together.

They brought him in to talk with me. That enough was making me shake, and I was digging my nails into my legs to keep from shaking. I don't know why I didn't tell them I wanted to leave. I guess I was afraid of giving him the satisfaction of knowing I was afraid...

After seeing him fake-cry and show the counselor how I probably faked the posts by bringing in some he made on photoshop, I couldn't take it. I left the room in sobs. 

I switched schools not long after and finished high school at a different place. 

There was one incident at the second school where an incoming student transferring from my old school said they met someone who knew me, Arthur, who said hi, and I freaked out so badly I had to leave for the day. The concept of him knowing where I am scares me. But since then there were no incidents.

I went to college and kept up contact with only a handful of people from my first school, and honestly I only talk to one of them often. 

This friend is nonbinary, and was, at the time of the Arthur incident, one of my closest friends. They IDed at the time (not anymore) as a lesbian, and knew Arthur through GSA. I only told them after they left school with him the actual extent of what he did to me. 

They told me two months ago that their little sister who still knows Arthur, said that Arthur is an out trans woman now.

I found this out while venting about Arthur to them, when they said ""Arthur goes by Lana now, actually.""

I told them I really struggle to imagine Arthur as a person existing anywhere outside of who he was back then. I struggle to see Arthur as a woman. It's hard for me to see Arthur as anyone other than the man who left me with lifelong trauma and made me try and kill myself.

They stopped speaking to me. Said it was transphobic of me to do this. That's when I sent in the post to asktransgender. 

The responses of ""why don't you just talk it over"" have some morbid parallels for what my school told me. I hated looking at them. I hated myself for how my trauma was making it hard for me to visualize Arthur as a new person.

My friend has started talking to me again since then, but I try and only mention the Arthur incident in passing, and use ""that person"" or ""my abuser"" instead of any names or pronouns. It's very hard to format my thoughts genuinely while doing this, but there's not much else I can do.

That brings me to today... I find out this old post of mine has been brought back up on a radfem subreddit. 

Though I don't agree with everything people here seem to believe, I have to say it's refreshing to find people who don't believe I'm at fault for my trauma making it difficult for me to afford any respect, even just the respect of seeing my abuser as a person who continues to exist as a changed human or whatever, to someone who hurt me so badly. 

I don't want to clutter up the other post with this long winded thing, so I'm making this a new post. I'm sorry about that. You can ask me questions if you want, I can clarify things but I'd prefer to not talk in detail about the assault.

He made the mistake of telling a friend of his. This friend was like wtf and told literally everyone. Everyone stopped supporting his punk band, somebody put out an EP and the liner notes say, we were gonna do a split with this band but there’s a rapist in the band. That’s his reputation.  People still tolerate him but yeah, everyone knows, some people always hate him. \n\nAnyway, a few years later the punk scene is kind of splitting in two and this guy is getting invested in this punk influenced rave scene, lots of people are coming out as non binary, trans, etc. some were probably jumping on the bandwagon but who knows, it’s not my business. This guy though, starts wearing a wig first then eventually starts taking hormones and becoming a woman. He had a big tattoo saying ‘boy’ on his leg which he crossed out to write ‘girl’. He’s pretty much transitioning. \n\nThe reason why I don’t use his pronouns is because I think he’s full of shit and I had a trans friend back then who thought he was too. This person tried to sleep with me years ago and I left his house to catch a cab because I was seeing someone and not into it. The next day I had 20 missed calls from him and he showed up at my high school (I was 18, it was one of those adult high schools where you wear normal clothes) all my friends thought it was fucking weird. There was also a friend of mine with us that night who he’d been sleeping with and when he saw her at the school she was telling him, “you don’t even know getfree93, why are you so obsessed with her?” he screamed at her to fuck off. I should also state that I’m more conventionally attractive (tall, skinny, long hair) while this chick is a bigger girl with acne. \n\nOverall, I just don’t fucking trust him. I actually slept with him after I finished high school because I was super drunk and going through a bad time, that was before I knew about him raping somebody, he never makes eye contact with me now, totally avoids me even though we had a similar friendship group. He also told me, “you have great boobs, I’ve touched a lot of gross saggy boobs” when we had sex. \n\nYou see him commenting on something to do with game of thrones on Facebook and a well meaning feminist will comment saying “lots of rape, incest, etc.” to warn him.

They treat TIMs like children. ', 'I believe one of the biggest reasons why this happens is because my mom told me as a kid that to get men to do things you have to puff them up. To get my brother to take out the trash I had to tell him how he\'s the best trash taker outter in the world, no one can take out the trash like he can, just the world class trash taker. If you make a big deal of it they will be more inclined to do it. It\'s really lame and I\'d bitch about it being stupid and a waste of time. The trash needed to be taking out, I didn\'t want to do it, he didn\'t want to do the vacuuming. It was fair for him to do it if I was doing the other chore. I had to do many chores with little to no praise but if he did the same the alarm went off and the party horn was blown. It was eyeroll inducing but a lot of men need constant stroking because the male ego is fragile and volatile. Being ""manly"" and ""macho"" is such a narrow list of acceptable behaviors and straying even once for a mere 5 minutes can make you a ""sissy"", ""gay"", ""woman"", ""weakling"", ""little girl"", etc. So in order to maintain the energy it takes to be aggressive, demanding, in control, domineering, pushy, violent and forceful it can easily crumble with just one word or comparing them to a woman then BOOM it crashes down into a fire of male rage. \n\nMost women are also told what we like is stupid, waste of time, waste of money, vain and just overall bad. So when a guy likes it to we go ""wow, so it\'s not actual shit?!"". But it\'s terrible when these men take opportunities from women and we let them. Women should be the CEOs and owners of almost all of the cosmetic and fashion industries. Why? Because we are the main consumers and demographics for those things. But it\'s all men, the industries even for women are male dominated. This also leads to sooo many problems where certain gay male designers have cultivated eating disorders for generations of women by only using models that are rail thin as it fits their aesthetic. Why? Because most of them don\'t find the female form attractive or necessarily beautiful, they preferred a more masculine or boyish body shape that most women can\'t have naturally due to us naturally carrying more weight than men (to biologically be able to have children). \n\nI also view guys like the OP mentioned as ""gosh I\'m so quirky and unique"" types. Like gimme praise. I also see how sometimes gay men get more support than gay/bisexual women. I was told it was just a ""phase"" when I came out as bisexual but my brother was embraced for being gay. I think it\'s fine that women support the gay male community but they often have a problem respecting us. Calling us ""real fish"", ""fishy"" or making other comments, there also can be hostility because straight men are attracted to us and not them (trans men who want to be women often say over and over again how their boyfriends are straight and totally not gay, sorry dude if you both have dicks it\'s at least bisexual).

bsjpde,bsjpde,"Cellulite is a female secondary sex characteristic and should be celebrated as a rite of womanhood, not despised or eradicated.","It has to do with the way our bodies network fat. Female bodies create sort of a mesh network to support fat (female bodies are MUCH more hardy in times of stress) and it can present as delightfully lumpy. More than 90% of women have visible cellulite, but all women store fat in this manner.

Men’s lattice pattern collagen threads holds subcutaneous fat in a way that, when the skin expands because of the fat storage, it expands evenly. Women’s “pockets” expand unevenly when we accumulate fat, creating that orange peel effect. Our storage pattern means we can healthily store more fat than men. Like a woman with 25% body fat is average, a man with 25% body fat is chubby. Because of that, women are hardier in times of stress or famine. It’s also one of the reasons why our bodies can survive pregnancy, which is a massive energy demand on our system.

And there’s absolutely NO “treatment” for cellulite that will work. They are all bullshit designed to separate you from your hard-earned cash. It’s a secondary sex characteristic, it’s perfectly normal and it’s not going away no matter what you do. Like I’m very lean myself and I work out 5~6 times a week, and I still have cellulite. Someone giving a woman shit for having cellulite is akin to giving her shit for having skin. It’s just a mixture of misogyny and corporate greed.

It\'s the worst part of a great city. In all the six months I lived in Amsterdam I went there once with a friend who really wanted to see it for herself. It\'s just horrendous.

I wanted to see it in person in order to add some heft to my arguments for it. The *moment* I stepped foot in the red light district, I realized that everything was horribly wrong. Women were on display in windows. Some of the windows opened, so that men could open and inquire how much, or just make lewd comments. Tourists took photos and the women just had to stand there, looking uncomfortable and unhealthy, nothing more than objects. I was completely horrified. In less than 5 minutes my views on “sex work” completely changed, all thanks to seeing it in action. And this was before I’d even learned about the human trafficking aspect of it all. \n\nThis was over a decade ago, and it saddens me beyond words that there has been no change. None.', ""> Halsema said that she was “pragmatic” and would not challenge ***the right*** for women to be involved in sex work in Amsterdam.\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\n*The right* to be raped, abused, humiliated and degraded? Seriously? *The right* to have a city district, dedicated to the selling and buying of women? That on its own should be seen as an obscenity, something that just cannot be tolerated in a civil society. None of this should be normalized. \n\nWhat does maintaining a red light district say about how the city sees women? Is it okay for women to wander one of the streets, only to discover that she's in a place where she gets treated like a fuck-object, where she sees other women being sold like merchandise? A district, dedicated to the selling of women where men reign supreme and are the customers? How does that belong in the 21st century? It's basically a women-dehumanization-area where women get treated like meat, including non-prostituted women, who get harassed by the johns. All this should've ended decades ago.\n\nI think this goes beyond the question of the individual ''sex worker'' (ugh) who ''chooses'' it (or not). On its own, per definition, the whole concept is a depravity. A society loses its dignity with the tolerance of such practices."", ""I love how the author throws this little dig in at the end: \n\n>Last year an audit of a previous 10-year project to clean up the red-light district, involving the closure of 100 brothel windows and extra checks on owners, had failed to reduce human trafficking.\n\nTranslation: it's going to happen anyway so don't bother trying to do anything about it. \n\nThe author could have expanded on this by saying that there *are* other ways to combat trafficking, such as the nordic model, but this little editorial choice really exposes their true intent and the bias of the Guardian in general."", ""Halsema is obviously sincere in her wish to stop human trafficking, but yesterday in an interview she herself admitted that the vast majority of prostituted women is foreign/doesn't speak Dutch, which makes them even more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.. yet I was very surprised that she never once suggested to help prostituted women exit prostitution and find a safer and healthier occupation, much like what is usually attempted whenever people lose their jobs when dangerous factories are closed. \n\n\nThe municipal council had several proposals as I recall, where one would be to close it all down, but one of the other ideas was to *increase* the amount of 'windows' since 'men and LGBT people may also wish to [advertise themselves]' (?!). I really hope that the conversation she plans to have with the prostituted women will change her mind, because it seems they secretly still care more about tourist revenue than the safety of prostituted women and, hell, even the people who live there.\n\n\n \n(Unfortunately the only party that would even consider limiting or ending prostitution opposes it based on Christian morality..)"", ""I've been there once and never again.

I also felt  bit disgusted with myself because even though I would never purchase sex or interact with any of those women, it felt like I was a spectator at a zoo filled with dehumanized women who were merely objects to be ogled at. Some of the women were standing near an open door or behind an open window where men would either ask for a price or yell obscenities at them - usually it was the second. Surprisingly, I also saw a huge group of Chinese tourists (I assume they were Chinese) with men and women of all ages. Just knowing that these kind of tours are sold boils my blood.  \n\n\nI've read a thing or two about this on several Dutch websites and I wish this title was the whole story, but it isn't. They are thinking about ''closing'' the red light district by either moving the girls somewhere else or by making the area more discreet. This isn't about the women who work there, they just want to shove the problem under the rug. These kind of talking points only give an illusion of change so the politicians can move on and have a rebuttal against outside pressure. If they truly wanted to do a thing about human-trafficking then they would listen to our northern neighbors and enforce the nordic model.

9jk2fa,9jk2fa,I was a sex worker for 5 years and 99.9% of my experiences were nothing like what pro-prostitution rallyers claim.,"Posting on a throwaway but I posted some of my experiences elsewhere a while ago and someone pm’d me to post here as well. 

So cutting to the chase, I was an escort from when I was 22 to 27. My life has been ruined in many ways due to my choices and I accept it and try to make the best of it, but I get so disgusted when I see people (mostly men) viciously defend prostitution on the internet based on that “one friend” they have who’s a prostitute and LOVES it. 

I was an escort and I started in university to get some extra cash like most dumb college aged girls. I had a ton of debt and my parents were no help. It’s the oldest story In the book but I met some women who were sugar babies claiming to make easy thousands and I got hooked. There’s nothing positive about sex work but if I could attribute just one word it’s that it’s just “easy” at first at least...

I was 22, barely out of college and I was desirable. Never listen to words coming out of an early twenties hooker because this is essentially their peak and they don’t even know it. I was shy, nervous, inexperienced (which are huge draws-no surprise) and after posting a few profiles I had a lot of offers. Some for only a few hundred a month but others for thousands and even more. I shopped around at first because I really thought this was like online dating in a way. You have choice and you get paid too. 

After a few “dates”which are really just negotiations I ended up with this older guy around the same age as my dad. He was probably the nicest and most accommodating client I’d ever had. We met a few times a month and despite what certain online “tell all’s”have said all sugar daddies expect sex. I have literally never heard of girls getting paid thousands for conversation.

When he ultimately ended the arrangement with me I was a full fledged sex worker. I mostly operated through word of mouth and a few low key postings but it wasn’t too difficult to find clients. I was still in a major college town and there was always business once my contact started getting passed around. HOWEVER what I can’t emphasise enough is how soul sucking the job actually is. It starts slow and you learn to desensitise yourself at first. You tell yourself most people are just prudes for stigmatising sex work. In fact, you tell yourself that you’re actually the smart one, because you were able to push through society’s regressive attitude and make yourself some serious bucks. If you’re not the cleverest entrepreneur then who is? 

Remind yourself of this logic when you encounter women or men who try so hard to justify sex work as empowering. They’re in denial. I know this because at a later point roughly all of my friends were fellow escorts. 99% of the escorts I met hated their jobs and made it no secret. But they had obligations- kids, dead beat husbands,debt, sick parents even. Most of them gave themselves timelines, this much time to work to save up this much money before they found a real job. It’s no surprise, because most johns are some of the most disgusting men you can imagine both physically and personality wise. Ask any retired sex worker about clients that have insulted them, physically tried unapproved acts against their will, or threatened them in any way for discounts and the honest ones will ask you where to start. The fantasy of the Richard Gere-esque “gentleman John” is fucking untrue and basically a kind of fanfic imagined by guilty men.

Well the remaining 1% tended to be the loudest advocates of prostitution while enduring the absolute worst. It’s like some kind of weird switch that goes off in their brains. These were the women that were abused pretty routinely by clients. These were the ones that accepted men who liked to degrade them because that was part of the “fantasy” of being with a prostitute. These were also the ones that tried to manage their hurt by completely turning it around and labelling it as empowerment. They were virulent internet defenders, making these really big proclamations of how glamourous their lives are, how much they earn, how much they pity regular women with their leaching families and minimum wage jobs. They are the often the ones spreading ideas that most male clients are sooo respectful because the woman is actually the one in power (can you believe it).

I wanted to post this because I’m sick to death of seeing this kind of pro-prostitution sentiment while insecure, entitled men quote delusions of deeply hurt women as justification for their continued abuse of sex workers. It is an objectively terrible, soul draining, isolating industry that chews up young women and change their lives for the worse. I’m angry at the women who defend it too, but i understand that most do it as a form of self-medication for their own traumas.

Sex is ALWAYS a requirement.  You go to any sugar baby forum with the women that do it and they will confirm that sex is required.   Its SUPER DANGEROUS to be telling young women that they can go to fancy dinners and receive gifts or even fly to foreign countries to meet men as part of an arrangement that doesn\'t require sex.

Early 20s and almost forcefully pro sex-work while at the same time holding the perspective that sex work wasn\'t for everyone. One day I asked her how she felt empowered by it (after she had used the word to describe what she does) and she gave a response along the lines of, ""Men are throwing money at me just to have me touch my boobies? They\'re so stupid [nervous laugh] I don\'t know..."" \n\nNow I am not a psychologist. But I got the feeling that through her (seemingly pretty fucked up) life she became both fed up with her sexuality and body being used/sexualized while at the same time feeling as though such experiences were ""normal"". By being a ""sex worker"" she felt she had found a way to ""weaponize"" these experiences and such normalization by charging men money to sexualize her rather than them doing it for free. Such is the sentiment behind a lot of women and girls who might seek out sex traffickers, pimps, or johns... ""I am being dehumanized and devalued and exploited for my sex. Might as well get paid for it.""\n\nShe was open about being a lesbian and considered pretending to be straight as just part of her job.

I do sincerely hope, for her sake, that she was bisexual even if that means she was appropriating lesbianism because the alternative to me is so much worse.

Money fucks you up. It doesn\'t really matter *what* thing you do because you like doing it, once you start to get paid for it, your internal incentives to do it will become weaker. The more you get paid, the less you will actually enjoy doing what you\'re doing. And sex work *really pays* for young women. So, while you might get bored with and emotionally distanced from a hobby after ten years of doing it for a normal salary, you\'ll extremely quickly get bored with and emotionally distanced from sex once you start doing sex work.

9ivmby,9ivmby,"So, I've recently been called a ""misogynist conspiracy theorist"" by PornHub's community manager for decrying abusive porn and pointing out that most free porn sites are owned by their parent company, MindGeek. Wanna hear my take?","Wanna hear something the porn industry doesn't want you to know? Notice how the front page of every porn site has material that would be considered incredibly disturbing even a few years ago? Simulated children, simulated incest, cuckolding. etc? Not to mention that it's now expected for people to watch porn of and lust after others while in ""committed"" relationships.

I've looked into it and found that the heart of the porn industry lies within a secretive company called MindGeek, whose main office is in Luxembourg, but has an office in LA. They're an ""influencing company"" ([https://www.mindgeek.com/](https://www.mindgeek.com/)) whose main goal seems to be to push certain types of content to the masses. Notice how their website doesn't actually say what they do and uses so much evasive language? Because they actively push certain content onto porn sites to try to influence the masses. And, by the way, they WANT minors watching it.

They own PornHub, Brazzers, XTube, and a whole lot of other familiar names. Porn stars get blacklisted from the industry when they even mention MindGeek.

Now people won’t pay for porn because they can get it for free. Add revenue is not as lucrative or reliable on the internet. It is the same problem all media is having, and hardcore fetish porn, is how the porn industry is trying to respond. People who like hardcore fetish porn are more willing to actually pay for porn, so they drive content, not your average viewer. \n\nThe entire American economy is undergoing historic market consolidation, so it is not surprising that pornography isn’t immune. Big tech companies have consolidated enormous power, and now just buy out any potential competitors. Regulators in the US aren’t willing to enforce antitrust laws for the original purpose at the moment—preserving competitiveness and ingenuity. As long as businesses promise a low price for consumers and a reasonable value, regulators won’t bat an eye at further consolidation. The government has historically been unwilling to regulate porn, which likely makes this issue even worse. That is one of the many reasons workplace regulations are so terrible for performers. Their health and safety are not taken seriously like other industries and it shows. \n\nI’m glad you made this post. If you consume porn, it is like anything else, you should be thoughtful about your consumption habits. How are your habits effecting others? Is there a more ethical way to engage with this activity? There is no easy answer because there are endless debates about the very basic ethics of pornography? That doesn’t get anyone off the hook for being thoughtful about their behavior. There are content producers who try to create ethical pornography with ethical content and ethical employment practices. However, in the society we live in today, accessing “ethical” porn will require paying money for the services you would like to consume.

bmwl6b,bmwl6b,John Mulaney is a terf,"John Mulaney is pretty popular right now, lots of young people seem to love him. I think he’s hilarious. In his older comedy sets, he has a bit on drag queens that is hilarious and insightful. Here’s the text:

“I have lots of drag queens around and I like to study them—and I mean, more of your high-end type of drag queens, not like your tenderloin drag queens. Who, I'm sorry, aren't even fucking trying. Like a lot of them just have a mop on their head and a skirt and are like, ""I'm a gal!"" You're not a gal. You're not a gal.

Really fancy drag queens are funny though, 'cause like a lot of drag queens, it's like they're under the impression that they're like, a celebrity. It's like they all have this attitude of like, ""Don't you know who I am? I'm Strawberry Alarm Clock."" It's like, ""No, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. It's just I don't hang out in the one bar where you get free drinks.""

I wanna say this though, I think it's fine if someone wants to be a drag queen, that's great, if you wanna like, express your inner woman. But why, with so many drag queens, is it always the same type of woman? Like, why is it always like, a big and brassy woman? With like, a beehive hairdo and alligator skin shoes? It's like, what is your notion of a woman based on? A housewife in a Far Side cartoon? Why is that what you think femininity is?

And then, some of these drag queens, they'll go out on the street, and they'll bully me. They will. They'll be like, ""Oh-hoh, look at him and his little shirt."" It's like, why are you mean? Why is that part of it for you? And it's not little, it's a medium. Small is little. You went through all the trouble to put on a nice dress, and now you're gonna be rude and bossy to people? It's like, do you know what your version of a lady is a lot like? A guy. You could've stayed a guy if you were gonna be an asshole about it.”

It\'s all hyper exaggerated feminine traits, to the point of it being ridiculous . Usually they are huge, tall men in ridiculous costume/cosplay, who put on an act that just basically makes a mockery of gender in general. They will present certain masculine traits mixed with feminine traits and almost always this is for comedy. \n\nThis came originally from the fact that gay people were socially shunned and had pariah status for decades, and our only real spaces that were safe, (and I mean physically safe), were our gay bars. And in these bars these gay men started performing presenting these super ridiculous feminine traits as a sort of ""Fuck You"" to society who saw gay men as being ""weak"", ""feminine"" and ""camp"" - This obviously going with the rampant misogyny of the time - (that old toxic idea that being female was somehow wrong/weak). \n\nIn a way, these drag queen had something in common with the people here on this sub - they were critical of gender.

All the posters have chalked this up to the TIM being “hormonal” and going through “second puberty.” Classic TRA stuff.

> I think it's very important that when we describe the people who we're attempting to exclude that we make it clear that we're not excluding them because they identify as transgender or identify as women.

> We're excluding them because they're men.

> Even if they stopped identifying as transgender or stopped identifying as women they would still be excluded.

> The fact that they identify as trans has nothing to do with why they can't join a women's organisation.

> It's got everything to do with the fact that they're men. And women's organisations currently have the right to exclude men and this right is protected legally and celebrated socially.

A week later my little stalker took his pudgy Cheeto stained fingers to his keyboard and penned his best defence of the rights of men to invade women's spaces and appropriate feminism.

I hope he doesn't ever change. It's men like him (the men who have no subtly) who are the best at showing women that trans rights activism is nothing more than a branch of the men's rights movement and that the transgenders have sold them a bill of goods.

You know some “TERF” might feel uncomfortable with your presence yet DON’T CARE because your validation comes first before a woman’s sense of safety. That is so MALE. If I were making men uncomfortable in their restroom I would fucking leave. One smaller TIM in the restroom with me isn’t my greatest concern, it’s the degradation of sex as a class, and a little catgirl in the corner is the embodiment of that. I do feel for a scrawny little TIM but there is no material difference between a TIM I could fight and a male who I cannot fight who claims a female gender ID simply to access women. I just don’t understand how TIMs don’t see this. It seems like a lot of them think our fears of rape are overblown or something, lmao i was raped multiple times by multiple men before I even turned 18. Almost all of my female friends have had at least one sexual assault experience. Not a fear, an experience. It’s not overblown\n\nI feel sad for men who are living in the chains of masculinity. My husband said the same thing “well, I can see why men would want to be a women, sometimes I want to be beautiful. Women are beautiful.” So I had to explain feminity to him, again, and remind him that if you are not a conventionally attractive woman, you’re pretty screwed, and that being beautiful is an oppression to us just like being tough and gruff is an oppression to him. Two sides of the same coin. It was easier to get through to him explaining it that way. Men should be able to express love and tenderness freely while also embracing the sex that they are.

As in I myself, or someone on this sub.\n\nAt first I thought nothing and thats the whole point, gender is nothing so there is nothing that makes me feel like a woman. \nBut then thinking a bit longer myself now, I think I feel like a woman when a man offers to help me with something, or when a man flirts with me, or when I am nervous Im being too loud or taking up too much space - because I know my male contemporaries would rarely think like that in the same ways - or I am scared to walk home alone at night. Those are times I feel my womanhood. But I would say there are extremely few times that I am doing something on my own that I feel it, during my period perhaps.. Otherwise I only experience my womanhood in relation to other peoples behaviors or mine in groups. \n\nWhich is also interesting - thats the suggesting my womanhood is in someways tied to other peoples view of it, maybe also why trans people find it so important that other people validate their woman or manhood. \n\nIts an interesting thought this ""what makes me feel or experience my womanhood"".

bnsqok,bnsqok,"Gender reassignment surgery rarely leads to true happiness. I’m trans, had SRS and I absolutely regret this. What I regret even more is how the trans community keeps so many things hidden from those looking into getting body modification surgeries as extreme as GRS!","Trans woman here. SRS with dr McGinn ( who is a trans woman herself ) in 2014. 5,5 years post-op and I can tell you one thing: I absolutely regret this. The upkeep and maintenance, the urinary tract infections, the fact that it is shallow and can barely fit a penis for penetration, the fact that penetration isn’t even enjoyable because my vagina has no internal part of the clitoris, no mucosal walls, no ruggae. It’s just a flesh pocket that consistently needs to be dilated. When I forget a couple dilation sessions, it is just plain right painful to get my dilation schedule started up again. But the trans community brushed my concerns off as “nothing to worry about” or with bullshit like “all those horror stories on the internet were written by TERFs to scare you out of GRS” . Well, I better had chickened out. Not only have I dealt with long post-op depression, my genitals aren’t as sensitive as they used to be. I still prefer anal sex over fake vagina sex, simply because it’s a struggle to fit the penis comfortably into my neovagina and I barely feel anything from the penetration of the flesh pocket itself. Most feeling comes from stimulating the clitoris, which is what used to be part of my penis head. The clitoris isn’t as sensitive as my penis head used to be. It doesn’t even have all the nerve bundles that a natal clitoris comes with. I wish I could have saved myself this sorrow. Now for the rest of my transition: did it make me happy? It made my life significantly more difficult. I am stealth ( meaning that you keep your past hidden from others ) and I am terrified that people will find out and discover my past. I still have gender dysphoria. I feel like I live in a male body that was molded to look like a female body. My body doesn’t feel like a genuine female body. Finding a partner is almost impossible as a trans woman, even in my case and I pass well as a female. Even if you find a partner, you always feel inadequate because you put them through a lot more struggle than they should have to go through, by being with a trans person. My story is fairly typical for the average MtF. Most keep all kinds of unresolved psychiatric problems, the distress always stays present and there is a general unhappiness in the community. Yet, transitioning is still positioned as a holy grail. Well, it’s not. I wish there would have been other ways to deal with the dysphoria. My health is also worse since I have been on hormones for a long period of time. My eye sight is significantly worse than before HRT, I have anxiety and I have a very slow metabolism. The trans community silences everyone who dares to speak up against the narrative of happy-ever-after. Telling us we never have been real trans and so on. To this day I live as a woman and I absolutely regret living a transgender existence. I’m male and nothing in the world can change that. The community needs to start to tell the truth and not try to erase the bad and the ugly that comes with this transition. I have bladder discomfort and urinary tract infections very regularly since I had GRS 5,5 years ago with dr McGinn. My surgery was considered a success. I wonder how bad the less successful cases are wrecked when I am considered a success story in this physical situation. Things need to change.

Validating their concerns and encouraging them to voice their opinion is extremely valuable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you talked to a doctor about discontinuing your hormone usage?

I would never want to give you medical advice myself, so I would say to talk to a few doctors about your options (implant removal, letting the surgical wound neovag close up by discontinuing dilation and how that would impact your urinary tract, etc.) You can\'t fix it and go back but you might be able to alleviate some of the medical problems. Ultimately, your physical and mental health are most important – not appearance. I assume that you are a gay male? It\'s quite plausible that you\'d have more luck finding partners who are gay men and are ok with a male partner who lacks genitalia than you would finding a straight man who is ok with a trans partner and a nonfunctional vagina.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\'d like to add something that I think might give a lot of TiMs pause: the reason the \'clitoris\' isn\'t as sensitive and doesn\'t feel right is because a true female clitoris is a LARGE structure that extends deep underneath the skin – it is not a little nub. When you cut a piece of the penis head and stick it on like that, it\'s purely for appearance, not function.

All medications have side effects. I’ve been on long term meds for a completely different condition and my doctors are very aware of the side effects and constantly monitor them and at the beginning warned me about it. But here we have the trans community acting like these medications won’t have any side effects or long term effects. ??? Every other drug has them! Why are hormones (KNOWN for their intense side effects) now suddenly exempt from this rule? \n\nNot to mention the long term effects of an extremely intense surgery (or surgeries). It’s so completely insane that ppl are being rushed into this. Again I’ve also had multiple surgeries for a long term medical condition and every time doctors do everything possible prior to surgery & my health insurance mandates this. They won’t cover surgery costs unless I exhaust every other possible option. But again with trans - surgery and hormones are the very FIRST steps! Why are we suddenly all treating this completely differently from every other long term medical condition? Why are doctors fast tracking people into these treatments? The only answer I can offer is the $$$ for doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and due to social pressure.

Idk where we all strayed from this ideal, but quite frankly it’s the healthiest path towards treating gender dysphoria IMO.  Encourage GNC and get into psychiatric treatment. Address the underlying issues. Dress however you wanna dress. But don’t lie to yourself and others & tell them that you are (or that it’s even possible) to change sexes. It’s not. And men dressed as women are not women. Idk why it’s not good enough to just live your life like this. Why demand that society acknowledge a lie? Why lie to patients and tell them that switching sexes is possible? Just let people be who they are. We don’t indulge the delusions of anorexics and let them get weight loss surgeries.

Also, I don’t blame kids who are sold a lie at a young age only to immensely regret that adults put them through such terrible experiences. I do request that you speak out when you see misogyny inflicted upon women in the name of trans rights. \n\nI’m sorry this happened to you and I hope you find peace. There is still much opportunity for you to have a happy life, especially now that you have accepted the faults with the trans agenda. Best of luck.', 'I\'m so sorry you were lied to and had to go through such a painful experience. I\'m sure the response from the trans ""community"" has been anything but compassionate, but I sincerely hope you can find a support system of people who understand what you\'ve been through. Your story is important and you deserve to be able to tell it without fear or shame.', ""Thank you so much for sharing your experience. You're very brave for speaking out about your surgery and the harm it put you through. I'm so sorry it is causing you pain. I'm FTM and I never plan on getting bottom surgery because it's terrifying. More trans people who have actually gotten bottom surgery need to be listened to"", '> My health is also worse since I have been on hormones for a long period of time. My eye sight is significantly worse than before HRT, I have anxiety and I have a very slow metabolism.\n\nJesus, I feel so bad for you - the mental anguish and who the hell knows what is happening in your body with all the hormones.

Your voice could be important in preventing another young healthy male from ruining their physical and mental health.', 'Jesus. That’s honesty indeed. Thank you for writing that. I hope others will give mature reflection before they have their cosmetic surgery.

The description you’ve provided about the form and function of your genitals is chilling and I know you had a good outcome. I really hope you are able to find happiness in life otherwise. \n\nAside from all the problems with the dishonesty of the trans community, another issue is that it seems trans vaginas are designed primarily with the intent that they can accommodate the size of penis during intercourse, not whether the trans vagina can bring pleasure to its owner. The whole design of the trans vagina seems to bent towards whether males can feel pleasure from having sex with one, not whether the person the trans vagina is attached to can have pleasure too. If doctors focused on the pleasure of the person with the trans vagina instead of the male pleasure gained from a male penetrating the trans vagina, then no doctor would recommend going ahead with such surgery. But women’s pleasure is never the priority so why would doctors make it a priority for trans women when they design trans vaginas? All that matters is it can fit a dick. Doctors are also to blame here and so is the misogyny that permeates medicine.', ""I'm very sorry for all that you've been through and that you feel you've been sold a bill of goods about SRS. I think half of the aggression of TRA's comes from the feeling that if they back down in any way from TWAW and stating a neovagina is the same as a natal one, then they may have to face reality that transition is imperfect and that it is impossible to change sex on a more than aesthetic level. It's brilliant that you're brave enough to speak up for your experience, and I hope that your health improves. Hopefully in the future, better treatments will come out to help alleviate the mental distress of dysphoria that can avoid painful, expensive surgeries and lifelong hormone treatments. I wish you all the best."", ""I'm sorry your community and the medical establishment have failed you so terribly. Here's hoping you can pick up the pieces and move forward with your life in a way that makes you happy."", 'Thank you for sharing your experience. I’m so sorry for what you now have to deal with, it sounds miserable. This stuff needs to be shouted from the rooftops.', 'I am so sorry.\n\nYour story reinforces my feeling that trans people should be encouraged to live as they want to without genital modification unless they have unbearable dysmorphia. I would much rather that almost all TW had penises and that we worked on wider acceptance - without of course demanding that natal women abandon their preferences as some TW are sadly doing - so that trans people could live healthy lives.\n\nI feel like all of you are being used as experiments without true consent. And that must stop.', 'thank you so much for sharing your story. unfortunately it’s not the first one I’ve heard that’s similar, but i wish more people could hear things like this before making life altering choices to their bodies. I certainly hope you get help, mentally and physically, to help with your dysphoria and the new problems that trans related surgeries did to your body. i can’t imagine how shitty it must feel, especially when everyone that you talk to with the same experiences says how wonderful and great it is. again thank you for sharing your story bc I think that the more open the trans community is with tales like these, it can help before before there’s no turning back.', ""A few words of comfort from a genetically female woman.\n\nI am straight and love having sex.

Just the way it is, andi think that's true for most women.\n\nHowever, the thing about being trans that no one ever really comments on is that i would say virtually all men view having sex with a trans woman as more off-putting than being with a man.

ccckxm,ccckxm,"Gender is meaningless, yet gender identity must be respected, yet gender norms mean nothing, yet presentation of gender has nothing to do with gender...My head hurts.","I'm new here and have to admit that I, for awhile, was totally cool with the trans community. You want to be called a he/she/they/whatever? Fine. What do I care? It doesn't impact or bother me. However, despite being part of these communities years ago (FB friends), I found myself cringing while I lurked on their posts and double-speak logic. Overall, their ideology confuses the fuck out of me and makes zero sense. 

&#x200B;

If gender is meaningless, and biological sex has nothing to do with gender stereotypes/norms/conformity, then why does being transgender even *exist*. Right? Like if you don't think women must wear dresses, or men must be masculine, then why the fuck should anyone need to feel like the opposite gender? Isn't this sort of an oxymoron? There was a person I knew who was a female, dressed feminine (dresses, makeup, etc) who then would flip out if someone assumed they had feminine pronouns. Anyone else getting whiplash from the confusion?

&#x200B;

Here's something I wonder. Lets say in 2050, suddenly, men can wear dresses and women can have short hair and work on cars, and it means nothing to society. ""Masculine"" traits aren't associated with men/penises, and ""feminine"" traits aren't associated with women/vaginas. None of this stuff holds any weight over biological sex or sexuality. Straight men can wear makeup if they want and no one would ever wonder whether they're a woman or gay or not. Lets say there are no norms, styles, or behaviors attached to biological sex, and people are either XX or XY, and that's it - no pressure to behave  or dress a certain way. Would there be people who are trans? I don't think so. There'd just be people with dicks who like football, or makeup, or cooking, or neither. Same for people with vaginas.

How can gender identity be both fixed and innate, ie biological yet be determined by reference to something that is a constantly shifting social construct - and which also varies across societies?  This is why TIMS who try to describe their ""gender identity"" inevitably end up referring to gender roles and stereotypes associated with women.\n\nThe only explanation for transgenderism that makes any sense to me is what the trans writer Julia Serano called ""subconscious sex"", that is, some sort of strong and persistent feeling that one is in the wrong sexed body.  I think these feelings are a delusion but they can be experienced very strongly by individuals, so strongly that their disappointment over not being able to change their sex drives them to suicide.\n\nOf course this explanation for transgenderism is rejected by most TRAs because its too transsexualist.', ""From my conversations with transmedicalists... there's basically people with meaningful gender dysphoria, who were historically called transsexuals, they generally seem to agree with most of what you've typed out above...

If it\'s got nothing to do with biological sex, and nothing to do with gender norms/roles, then what actually is it? If a woman is simply someone who identifies as a woman, what does the word ""woman"" mean? What are they actually identifying as?', '>Overall, their ideology confuses the fuck out of me and makes zero sense. \n\nThat\'s really the point of their rhetoric. Their assertions don\'t make sense and contain all sorts of internal logical contradictions, so their technique (which I\'ve seen over and over) is just to throw it all at you at once to try to ""baffle you with bullshit."" \n\nThe sad part is that it works on a lot of people, and if it doesn\'t and you\'re one of the people who starts to smell the bullshit, they just attack you as a transphobe and try to get you fired, banned, or otherwise silenced.', 'As far as I can tell, it\'s mostly about feeling uncomfortable with the stereotypes assigned to your sex (i.e. gender norms), deciding you\'d do a better job at fitting into the other set, and trying to wrest yourself into the other group via medical, personal, or social intervention.

Would there be people who are trans? I don\'t think so. \n\nI think it depends.  My impression is that a large part of being ""trans"" is wanting to be accepted as a peer to members of the opposite sex.  Almost universally, humans start to segregate themselves by sex starting at a very early age, forming ""tribes"" of same-sex friend groups.  I think if that\'s still happening in 2050, then there will still be people who want to be part of the other ""tribe.""

But now the actual concept of ""woman"" has been disassociated from bodies.\n\nAs was always the problem, pretending we don\'t have sexed bodies that function in particular ways, and are operated on in different ways by society is disingenuous.

(Not gonna harass/use me for sex, considerate of my feelings, etc).. basically that they inherently understood me (women) in ways straight men couldn’t. \n\nIt’s the same logic that made me extremely sympathetic to TIMs. That and the same “they face much worse than me” mentality, prioritizing the struggle of men being victimized by homophobia over my own experience with misogyny, because I didn’t have the lens to see the misogyny for what it was at that time, and no one was there pointing it out.\n\nSo I sympathized with gay men/TIMs because I was told to. For most of my life. And I didn’t even wonder why I never cared about lesbians. Sure, I prided myself in the admiration I had for all gay people and the strength it takes to be yourself and stand up to a world that hates you. But I didn’t include lesbians in my big hearty sentiments of compassion for who I considered *the biggest victims of the patriarchy* - surprise surprise - I thought it was men. \n\nGay men, queer men, men who don’t fit the quota. It’s not that I think GNC men don’t face brutal aggression and violence against them for who they are. It’s that I know now that we’re made to prioritize men’s experience over women’s. I didn’t realize the amount of brutal aggression and violence women face for who we are. That’s old news, I thought. I stayed naive for too long, too afraid of the disheartening truth.\n\nThe current libfem rhetoric around rape often tries to center male victims. So when women speak about rape, some sort of inverse “not all men” guy chimes in with “well some men” *do* get raped, and the numbers are vastly unreported, and no one takes them seriously, etc. (As if women have no problem being taken seriously when reporting rape)... Great, let’s talk about that now. *...Why are women expected to solve the problem of men being raped by other men?* Why is this now a feminist issue? Why is it considered callous and hateful and “bad feminist” to hold a conversation about male sexual violence towards women without including male victims? Why is male/male sexual violence expected to be a feminist issue, and not a men’s rights activists issue? \n\nWe know the answer. It’s because women are to blame for men’s problems, and women are the ones expected to fix men’s problems.\n\nBut I digress. I didn’t have a lot of sympathy for lesbians. I believed the mainstream hype we’re told: the worst things lesbians face is having their sexuality fetishized by men. Lesbianism, we’re told, is easy, because men like it when girls kiss but they don’t like it when boys kiss. So girls won’t get beat up about it the way boys will.\n\nIt’s horrifying that I believed that for so long. It’s horrifying that many people believe this still. It is so dangerously utterly untrue. It is the opposite. Men get offended when ignored by women. I know this now. I know that not “playing the game” they expect can lead to violence. \n\nI couldn’t see it then because I couldn’t see misogyny for what it was. I was blind to the issues that women face. I was blind to it in my own life, I was blind to it in the lives of other women. I was still caught up thinking men’s approval was the highest reward. I didn’t know then that their approval was often more dangerous than I realized, and I didn’t know how dangerous their disapproval was. Two lesbian girls being objectified for being cute and sexy? No biggie. Gay boys needed my help.\n\nNo one talks about when men get jealous. Or if they do, it’s “those men”. I couldn’t understand why so many of my friends dated abusive assholes. I didn’t see male violence as the epidemic that it is. So a few men might get jealous and violent with a lesbian not giving him attention, but *not all men*, right?\n\nSorry for the rant.

So, given that there's such an insane gap between the sexes re: criminal behavior, namely *violent* criminal behavior, it really frustrates me when male crimes (committed by TIMs) are reported as 'female'. r/thisneverhappens has a ton of examples of this new plague. 

The *statistical conflation of criminal behavior between the sexes* is *not* a gap that handmaidens should laud as ~progressive~ to 'fix'. It's just dragging actual women down in the shittiest of ways.

On a related note, I keep seeing studies of women's opinions where men (TIMs) were also answering as 'women'. This is wrong for a number of reasons. Men shouldn't be speaking as women on anything-- as trans'women', fine, but not as actual women. This ~progressive~ movement is slowly driving actual women out of their careers, out of their own politics, out of having their own voices in general.

I have a lot more to say on the topic, but I'll keep it short. Self-identification-driven conflation of the sexes is a slow but brutal erasure of women.

You already have to pay house dues and tip all the staff, which is how they get paid. The club doesn\'t have to pay them because you do. They\'ll hire way too many girls so that no one can make money, there will be more girls than customers, because the club makes more money off of the house dues they charge the girls than they do off the club itself.

If you don\'t tip the DJ extra, you won\'t get to dance on stage as much, meaning you make less money. The managers often talk down to you, like you\'re just a dumb whore.

People are going to grab you and try to do whatever. You won\'t make that much on the stage, barely enough to cover your dues, so the only way to make real money is to get private VIP dances. That\'s where you go to a private room with the customer for 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how much time he buys. There is not a dancer anywhere who doesn\'t DESPISE doing VIP, but doesn\'t have a choice because if you don\'t do them, you\'ll walk out broke. You spend the whole time basically fighting the customer off, as they try to do more than they\'re allowed. But you have to do it in a nice way, which is tricky. The official rules are that they can\'t touch you, but nobody will pay $200 not to be able to touch you, it\'s an unspoken rule that they get to feel all over you. When you\'re trying to sell the VIP rooms, the first thing they always ask is what do they ""get"" for that amount of money, and at least half of them decline, saying if they\'re paying that much, they better be getting sex. \n\nA lot of men will disrespect you and talk to you like you\'re a whore because they know you really need the money and you\'ll put up with them, so the strip club is the only place they can feel powerful. Some guys will say negative things about your body or say another girl looks better than you just to try to get to you. Some guys expect you to kiss their ass because they threw a few dollars on stage. Don\'t get me wrong, most of the customers were cool, but there was enough disrespect from the bad ones to make the job suck. \n\nI had some guys catcall at me as I was walking into the club, and I didn\'t feel safe and ignored them, and they keyed my car. I\'ve had customers try to follow me home. I\'ve had customers in VIP try to hold me down and rape me, and I got saved because the security guard said time was up. I\'ve had my tires cut by guys I refused to give my number to. \n\nOnce a guy tried to rape a girl in VIP, and the people in the room next to her heard her screaming and intervened. She had two black eyes. There was no security in VIP in this club, and the music was so loud security wouldn\'t have been able to hear you scream from where they were. I went to the manager and said they need to get a security guard for VIP because of what happened, and they lied and said it didn\'t happen and that they\'d never had a problem before. Obviously our safety wasn\'t worth paying a security guard for. \n\nA customer drugged my friend in VIP, and after he left, they found her on the floor not breathing. They refused to call 911 because it would have caused an investigation that would have put a point on the club\'s liquor license, so someone had to drive her to the ER. Paramedics could have given her oxygen, or resuscitated her, or whatever they do, plus got to the hospital faster, but who cares about her life? She was just a stripper whore. I wasn\'t there that night, because if I had been, I would have been like fuck y\'all and called 911. \n\nBeing a dancer fucked me up in a lot of ways. I\'ve been out of the club for 6 years, and it\'s taken me this long to get it out of my system and feel safe again. To tell people my real name again without being afraid of stalkers. There are some girls who love dancing, but they are rare. Most girls do it because it\'s the only option they feel they have, and they hate it. I had undiagnosed ADHD and had never been able to succeed on a job because of it. Some girls I worked with had heartbreaking stories. One 19 year old girl was dancing to try to get her mom an apartment so she could leave an abusive relationship. One girl\'s husband had been murdered, her kids had been taken away because she was homeless, and she just needed money to fight to get her kids back. A 15 year old Mexican girl with a fake ID who said she was 18 had been trafficked across the border and she was on the run from her pimps. She ended up getting arrested for identify theft (due to the fake ID) and deported. \n\nI remember going to pole dancing classes to try to up my skills to make more money, and most of the other girls there weren\'t dancers but they were so infatuated with the idea of it, but to me it was just work, not fun. I remember seeing a Britney Spears video where she pole dances, portraying a stripper, and I was mad. I felt like, she came from an affluent family and she\'s so rich, she\'ll never know what it is to do things you don\'t wanna do for money. If I went to a dance club on my off night and saw a girl dancing on the pole for attention, I couldn\'t understand why someone would degrade themselves like that and they\'re not getting paid. \n\nAll in all, the men are the ones who truly have the power in the situation. You dance on stage, then it\'s your job to go try to sell dances which is asking them to pay for something they just got to see for free already. They\'re going to get to see you naked either way. To me, the most degrading thing wasn\'t getting naked, it was going around having to ask men to buy dances. Nothing empowering about that shit.', 'There is nothing that more perfectly encapsulate liberal feminism than a bunch of middle class women sitting on their $1,000 computers telling a former prostitute to shut up because they understand her life better than her.', ""I have been labeled a SWERF even after talking about the reason for my swerfdom is seeing how much my niece suffered at the hands of her pimp.....they are so cruel because they will say shit like it isn't OUR fault some women can't handle it!

I\'ve listened to far too many memories about being beaten, stalked, raped, threatened, harassed, and ""outted"" ... It\'s a long list. The only woman I know who didn\'t have violence done to her was a topless dancer at an expensive club very briefly. Other strippers/dancers I know have had very different experiences so I\'m not sure if she was lucky or the club was run differently. I\'m not going to assume everyone gets or without violence but I\'ll freely admit that just because there is a high risk doesn\'t mean it\'s a certainty.

I used to think that liberal feminists did this because they were ignorant about the fact that there are women who've left the industry speak out against it, or they are ignorant about the dark side of prostitution (such as poverty being a factor in women entering prostitution and trafficking). But I think I'm becoming to realize that it isn't ignorance from them, it's far worse - they just don't care about how it affects women and society in a negative way and they don't care about helping women, they only care about glamorizing the sex industry while brushing everything else under the carpet. \n\nI feel like this issue is as much of a class issue. We have a minority of middle-class men and women who glamorize the sex industry and look down on and don't care about the vast majority of women in this industry. They are the people who use the terms SWERF to anyone who doesn't agree with them, this includes ex-prostitutes and women who don't agree with them. Their dismissiveness isn't just childish, it's also dangerous and damaging, especially for women who are in the industry and women who have left the industry. It's dangerous and damaging because it means that how the sex industry affects women and the experiences that they have gone through isn't taken seriously. It's also dangerous and damaging because most women don't want to be in the industry and therefore, they don't help these women find a route out of the sex industry. \n\nI'm sorry about your experiences with people calling you a SWERF."", ""Liberal feminists refuse to see a grey area in everything.

bjo9b9,bjo9b9,[RANT] A TIM shows up at an introduction course I gave yesterday morning to newly expecting mothers. I’m a nurse and I give newly expecting mothers tips for their soon to be new borns. I do this voluntarily. The TIM messed up everything.,"I do these sessions for newly expecting mothers thrice a year.
I’m a nurse. I have worked on several units over the years but have been working on neonatology for the last 5. There is this TIM who show up at an info session for pregnant women yesterday morning.
He wanted to know what it was like to be pregnant and soon to be expecting. He made all women very uncomfortable with his presence. We stayed polite because obviously making a scene wasn’t going to improve anything but he still managed to mess up my entire session.

When I showed the soon to be expecting new mums how to bathe their new borns, by help of a doll they each got, the TIM started mansplaining to the other participants how they had to do it right.

When I was showing them how to change diapers correctly, he started whining about his dysphoria and how we exacerbated his pregnancy dysphoria because he can’t carry his own baby.

I really had to grit my teeth sometimes, so that I would not lose my patience.

At one point he touches a woman’s belly ( this woman was calculated for the end of May ) without her permission, just because she told a woman next to her ( also due for late May ) to feel at her belly.

Honestly, I’m starting to loose my patience.
I can’t give sessions with this mindset.

I am thinking about giving the sessions privately at my house and only by invitation. 
To prevent horrible situations like this occurring again.

Intersex is about bodies; about congenital physical differences in sex characteristics.\n\n>Intersex, transgender, and same sex attraction are distinct concepts and issues, and people with intersex variations face distinct health and human rights issues.\n\n[Androgen Insensitivity Support Group](http://www.aissg.org/):\n>Intersexuality is not the same as a transsexuality (gender dysphoria) and is not a transgender state. Neither of the latter terms is one that we recognise as belonging in any general discussion of intersex. We are not happy with the recent tendency of some trans groups/people to promote transgender as an umbrella term to encompass, for example, transsexuality, transvestitism and intersex. We object to other organisations/individuals putting us in categories without consulting us, especially categories that imply that interexed people, of necessity, have gender identity issues.  \n\n[Intersex Society of North America](http://www.isna.org/faq/transgender):\n>In spite of these similarities, these two groups should not be and cannot be thought of as one. The truth is that the vast majority of people with intersex conditions identify as male or female rather than transgender or transsexual. Thus, where all people who identify as transgender or transsexual experience problems with their gender identity, only a small portion of intersex people experience these problems.\n\n>It’s also important to understand the differences between these two groups because in spite of some similarities they face many different struggles, including different forms of discrimination.

(Well we both have an idea, it’s that buttload of intentional denial and dismissal and delusion they live in) It doesn’t matter if our reproductive systems are functional or are typical, almost all people can be sexed by their gametes and genitalia. For the extremely rare intersex cases that are actually ambiguous (very very rare even within the intersex population), they still aren’t trans people and their conditions shouldn’t be thrown around to justify a sick fetish.

cqp8um,cqp8um,Thank you for giving me the language I needed,"A few weeks ago my teenage daughter and I were having a talk. She's been trying to figure out her own sexuality for a while.

While we were talking, she said to me ""sometimes I don't feel like a girl - maybe I'm a boy"". 

I said to her ""What does feeling like a girl feel like? What does feeling like a boy feel like?""

She told me that she didn't know, she loves her body, her curves, but she hates her period and she doesn't really relate to most of the girls in her class. 

I explained to her that sex is real, and gender roles are a construct forced on us from the time we are babies. 

That she's a girl, which means that she a female reproductive system, which is awesome, and that yeah, periods can suck, and so can other things which comes with being a girl/woman, but beyond that, most of the differences between boys and girls are the way we've been raised. 

She thought about it, and said - you're right, I never thought about it like that.

bcgw69,bcgw69,New data confirms that muscle size and strength is NOT reduced in transwomen after 1 year of “castration levels of testosterone” and estrogen treatment.,"Fair Play for Women posted [this abstract](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D35rcyCXoAEC_Va.png:large) from a poster presented yesterday at the EPATH conference, confirming what anyone with eyes and a brain already knows: allowing men to compete against women is fundamentally unfair. 

> Methods: 
Twelve transgender individuals, 6 trans women and 6 trans men who had been accepted to start gender-affirming medical intervention, were recruited. Knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry at three different angular velocities (0, 60 and 90 °/s). The assessments were made at four time points: (T1) before treatment initiation, (T2) four weeks after initiated gonadal hormonal down regulation but before hormone replacement, (T3) three months after hormone replacement therapy and (T4) eleven months after hormone replacement therapy. The cross-sectional area and radiological density of the thigh muscles were assessed by CT scans performed bilaterally at the midpoint of femur of each subject at baseline and after 11 months of cross-sex hormone treatment.

> Results and Conclusions: 
**Muscle area increased 17% in trans men** (p<0.001) with an 8% increase in radiology density after eleven month of cross-sex hormone treatment. **No change was seen in trans women.** There were significant (P<0.05) group x time interactions at each angular velocity. Thus, **while the trans men increased their strength over the four time points, strength levels were generally maintained in the trans women.** When averaging the three strength tests, knee extension (16%) and knee flexion (34%) strength increased from T1 to T4 in trans men. The corresponding changes in the trans women group were -6% and 0%, respectively. 

>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ~1 year of cross-sex hormone treatment results in increased muscle strength in trans men. Cross-sectional area and radiological density is also increased after testosterone treatment. However,** trans women maintain their strength levels as well as cross-sectional area and radiological density throughout the treatment period.** We conclude that the altered sex hormone pattern induced by gender-affirming treatment differentially affect muscle strength in trans men vs. trans women.",653,"[""\nWelcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

cgti4w,cgti4w,It's because we're women.,"I was just having a chat with my partner. He was asking if I knew that GC had been branded a hate sub.  I asked him why he thought that was and he said because of our views on trans women (that they aren't women). I reminded him that the bulk of humanity holds those same views, so why does our holding them constitute hate?

It's because we're women. 

Ricky Gervais has spoken out against JY on Twitter. He has vocal supporters defending him against accusations of transphobia. Meanwhile, Megan Murphy has been banned from Twitter for speaking out against JY. Most of the rest of us are too afraid to speak out, for fear of losing our jobs or facing violence against ourselves and our family. Why can't we speak out as freely?

It's because we're women. 

The thing that really gets me is that women are the people actually affected by all this. From the outside, it might look like we're obsessed. But we're the ones losing access to the sports we worked so hard to have. We're the ones being called bigots for not wanting to see penises in our locker rooms. We're the ones being manhandled between a rock and a cotton ceiling. We're the ones losing our jobs for trying to protect children. We're the ones being told womanhood -- our very existence -- is defined by sexist stereotypes instead of shared biology. 

It's because we're women. 

Women (but only ""cis"" women, for some reason) are expected to accommodate, to make everybody else feel better. And this particular group of women is now saying no to that this time around. No violence. No threats. No bullying. Just no blind acceptance and capitulation. Apparently that's hate?

bc19dv,bc19dv,Siiiiigh... Reddit lynch mob against female scientist from the blackhole research (rant),"Been despairing today at the backlash on Reddit against Dr Katie Bouman. Her photos have been hitting the front page multiple times because she's personable, attractive, played a central role to the exciting research, and *gasp* a female in STEM.

Cue the misogynists.

If you haven't seen the cesspools of comments then the main arguments are:

1. She's taking away from the **real** researchers in her group that did all the work
2. The media only pays attention to hot women -- female privilege!!!
3. It's attention seeking behaviour and she's looking to personally benefit.
4. She's lying and exaggerating her importance in the group -- she's only a minor player but calling herself the leader of the entire blackhole project

The ""evidence"" for (1) comes from some super smort Reddit sleuths who found her group's GitHub and have compared her code contribution versus the men in her team. A man has uploaded more than 4x the lines of code she has, absolute scandal! This poor man is being side lined for a lazy, second-rate researcher! Where's his TV slot?

I'm a scientist and a woman and this reaction really enrages and sickens me for so many reasons. I've done work with media people and outreach and this situation is horrible. I had to rant somewhere.

Firstly, the journalists are to blame for misinformation. When she gets inevitably doxxed I hope she calls them out on this. In all her interviews she is very clearly stating her place within a team and that her team is one of many. She did invent the very algorithm that creates the image and she is a team leader, but not the entire head of the project. The journalists keep captioning her as ""leader"" which is misinterpreted by others sharing the images. There's an obsession for journalists to find the head genius in any big science story and it drives scientists barmy:

&#x200B;

[""The woman behind...""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47891902) (One woman of many!) 

&#x200B;

[""The brilliant mind who....""](https://interestingengineering.com/katie-bouman-the-brilliant-mind-that-brought-us-the-image-of-a-black-hole) (One brilliant mind of many!) 

&#x200B;

[""Thank this grad student for the black hole image....""](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/katie-bouman-mit-black-hole-algorithm-sci-trnd/index.html) (Argh she's an assistant professor!!!!)

&#x200B;

These huge projects are team efforts first and foremost. The official head of the project (Dr Heino Falcke) probably barely saw any of the code or even knows how it really works. But that's okay! Everyone contributes or you don't get authorship.

Secondly, the journalists know the public prefer to have a human perspective on a heavy scientific discovery. The black hole image is... Well, faceless so there is a frenzy to find something relatable amongst the equations and data. Dr Bouman is a gift to these journalists. In the world of scientific computing for radio satellites, she is young and pretty and witty in interviews. You'd think her PhD from MIT would be enough but remember it's how hot a woman is first and foremost. The public won't listen to female scientists unless they have sex appeal.

She had taken her own photos throughout the work, including ""the moment"" it all came together. She has experience giving a TED talk. The media storm around her is inevitable because the alternatives are frankly uninspiring on camera.

Angry Reddit misogynists have interpreted her outreach work as self-serving and I am truly dumbfounded. A person who wants to be internet famous and a celebrity does not get a PhD in imaging via physical model inversion.

To say scientists avoid media work like the plague is an understatement. My colleague's paper did well in the media and she locked herself in her office and cried at the prospect of being interviewed and photographed. My male colleagues are similar, and many scientists who know there will be a storm around their paper often flee abroad to avoid it entirely.

However, for many female scientists there is a sense of moral duty to do outreach work and try to engage with the public. Many of us had few role models and we are thinking of the young girls who need inspiration in a world that tells them they can't do maths. It's trying to give back, make things a bit better. In addition some of us truly enjoy our field and want to share it with others. When I see Dr Bouman's social media and talks it's the same vibe. She's not trying to be an Instagram influencer or get on Oprah.

I think most women don't enjoy being the token female scientist. I hate it when random people praise me for just working in a scientific field.  **This shouldn't be remarkable**. Getting media attention like this can feel like you're being pointed out as an anomaly rather discussing your contributions. So yes, women get media attention but it's hardly a privilege. It mostly feels like ""look at this female creature using her brain! Extraordinary!"" And again, first and foremost media cares about your sex appeal.

And finally as a computational scientist the GitHub sleuthing really got to me. The dude with 800k lines of ""code"" was mostly uploading lines of data, aka dogsbody work. Scientific programming is NOT software development. Dr Bouman's algorithm might be 10 lines long but it's the foundation and therefore a massive contribution to her team's work.

I'm sad and angry that everyone starts picking apart female scientists for taking too much credit, meanwhile Elon Musk is eternally worshipped online for ""inventing rockets"" and ""he'll take us to Mars"" like his engineers don't exist. No one is looking up Musk's GitHub contributions.",639,"[""\nWelcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

Many of us accepted the claims of trans activists, wanting to be fair and non-exclusionary, until we really listened to what they were saying, and compared it to our own knowledge and experience. Can ""woman"" be just an identity, divorced from biology? Can penises be female? Should girls who don't like dolls be treated with double mastectomies and lifelong hormones? Are you ready to reach peak trans? Or do you just want to know what those radfems you've heard about are saying so you can debunk them? Read on... and get ready to add your own story!

",621,"['Sorry, but I’m re-peaking with the rise of trans kids.\n\nI just can’t wrap my mind around how regressive it is. Your “daughter” was born a boy but is actually a girl because he likes dolls and dresses.And *gasp* the color pink. (I just got done watching a trans kids doc and this is literally what most of the parents are saying).\n\nAnd I can’t believe how many ‘woke’ liberals are pushing this shit.', ""Hi,\nI got banned from r/transgender for this post which is ridiculous and kind of despicable. I hope someone here can either relate or provide some kind of advice/support. Anything is very much appreciated.\n<3\nOkay so here's the story.\nMy childhood best friend (now a man) came out to me as trans last year. I completely accepted him as I'm open minded etc. But as time elapsed and he became male.... I became very aware of the fact that he started talking cultish-ly. Everything was about trans-rights and trans this. I was supportive but it didn't feel like the person I had known for 35 years. I felt like I was losing him as a friend. I'm not going to lie.. I miss the girl I grew up with. The one who was my wife's maid of honour. I feel like I've lost such a big part of my heart.\nI wish I could still call her Becky but he hates that. I'm in my forties and I am very emotionally shaken by how rude the trans community was when I brought it up with them seeking support. Apparently I'm a transphobic dick for accidentally misgendering my BEST FRIEND WHO I KNOW. When you oppose them or even merely suggest that their ideologies are harmful, they get vicious. I'm in a dark place because I am being forced to mourn my buddy.\nThank you. Jon E\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you ladies so much for your support. I thought I would not be accepted here but it means a lot that you are genuine human beings."", 'Hello!  I am a first time poster, long time lurker.  Posting from a throwaway because these are some scary times we are living in.  \n\nAbout me: I actually have a degree in ""Gender Studies"" (The University changed my Women\'s studies major to this part way through my degree, and I had very much consumed the liberal feminist kool-aid.  When I first began my degree, I felt so inspired and empowered by what I was learning about.  Reading Dworkin, Lorde, Learner...It felt like a whole new world had opened up and I could put a name to this anger and pain I had been feeling throughout my life.  I was inspired my class discussions, professors, etc.  I felt like feminism just ""fit"", but also that it challenged me very deeply  to question the institutions of power that had shaped my life. It was life-changing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward five years to the end of my degree, and everything was about pronouns and genderbread.  It felt shallow and petty a lot of the time, but I felt like maybe i just wasn\'t trying hard enough to understand the hype when I should be because I was \\*cis\\*. I distinctly remember we were assigned a reading by Audre Lorde and when the Professor opened up the discussion for comments, a white gay man in the class piped up that he had proudly ""refused to do the reading in solidarity with trans folks, because Lorde was a transphobe!""  After that, no one said anything.  The Professor seemed annoyed by this, but she didn\'t say anything and moved on to something else. I remember feeling like this wasn\'t right, but who am I to question things if it was hurting trans peoples feelings?  I would be looked at as a bigot.  This interaction continued to irk me,  though, and at the time it was hard for me to articulate exactly why this was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCombined with a number of these types of unsettling interactions, my peak trans moment was a real doozy.  My partner works at a community centre that has ""trans friendly"" changing rooms.  So, it says ""welcome trans people"" on the outside of the entrance to the ""woman\'s"" ""men\'s"" and ""universal"" ones. Again, when this were first implemented I was an advocate that these were a good thing.  He came home one day and told me a story about what had happened at the centre that day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe told me that he had received complaints about a person in the women\'s changing room from one of the patrons,   \n about someone who was apparently acting indecently.  As he is a man, he had to ask the only female employee on staff (an eighteen year old girl) to go check on the situation.  She checked in on what happened and reported back that a patron who claimed to be a woman was walking around the changing room...with a massive hard penis!  It was making the other women uncomfortable.  She literally had to ask an aroused, naked, grown ass man to please cover himself, which he wouldn\'t do until she left.  An 18 year old girl making minimum wage at a community centre.  The worst part is the way that they had to frame the conversation to this asshole.  Because their trans policy is self-ID, this loser couldn\'t be banned from using the women\'s (open) changing space, they just said he can\'t be in there if he is ""visibly around"". UGH.  My parter also was informed that the other centres in the city were also having a problem with  this same piece of shit, and he was doing the same thing in other places.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me a while to peak from this, because when i told a few people they said ""well clearly he\'s not really trans"" - I tried to believe this for a bit, but i kept coming back to the blatant lack of logic here. But the policy is self-ID, isn\'t the whole point that we can\'t determine if someone is or isn\'t?  Why should we assume that this won\'t keep happening when it has already happened all across the city?  Aren\'t we constantly being told that trans women HAVE GIRL PENISES.  Why is someone who does gross, shady, abusive shit NOT trans?  It didn\'t make sense. Still, I tried to put it out of my mind but these thoughts seemed bigoted based on this narrative I had been trying to believe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy peak moment was after I caught myself defending this loser.  I was talking to my mom about this and she said ""well, this is why i believe women should have separate spaces for changing, so that they don\'t get assaulted by men"" - I immediately said that the issue here was that the trans person was ""turned on"" not that he has a penis, and make other cringe worthy excuses.  A couple days later I was thinking over what I had said, and something inside me just shifted.  I was grossed out - the logic DIDN\'T make any sense - it\'s ridiculous to gate keep the trans identity only when it\'s someone who is acting in a way that people don\'t like.  The new policy HAD facilitated this piece of shit going in and exposing himself to women and girls.  If this was 20 years ago, he would have been arrested!  I began to cry and felt like I had betrayed myself and what I used to believe in, and felt angry that this was happening to women and girls. \n\n&#x200B;', 'So just discovered this place today. I\'m a gay male and understand this is mainly coming from a female perspective, so apologies in advance, but enough is enough.\n\nLike most gays, I was ignorant of yet tolerant of trans people. But just as many of you recount how TIMs invaded women\'s spaces, TIMs, TIFs, and transtrenders have invaded gay spaces over the last couple of years. I lived in Seattle and you would be socially excommunicated if you said anything ""gender critical"" or a basic biologic fact like ""I\'m a gay man who is attracted to men, so I don\'t want to sleep with a \'guy\' with a vag."" I was also shocked by how idiotic their logic is, like how can this movement believe both gender is a fluid spectrum yet trans people were inherently trans? Also, why does ""acting"" like a man or a woman make you a man or woman yet supposedly traditional gender roles are evil?\n\nThe point where it was really ridiculous came when Grindr (a gay hookup app) allowed **BOTH** TIMs and TIFs. You can make a case for one or the other (however stupid that case may be), but having both is just absolutely ridiculous. There is no logic and it seems every year, their ideology gets more and more totalitarian and gains more and more power in the mainstream. I\'m now watching in horror as my lesbian friends are labeled TERFs for not wanting to sleep with someone with a penis. It\'s utter insanity.\n\nI also have issues with the approach to gender dysphoria in general. It\'s not like I think GD doesn\'t exist, but I\'m still baffled that the mainstream medical community would see bodily mutilation through sterilizing/cancer causing hormones and surgeries as better treatment than, I dunno, helping someone come to terms with the body they have? To top it all off, as a guy with gynecomastia, I find it infuriatingly ironic that insurance doesn\'t cover me getting rid of my possibly cancerous man-boobs that have led to debilitating self-esteem issues throughout my life but all ""gender affirming"" treatments and surgeries are 100% covered. Like what the actual fuck?', 'Someone made a post on Facebook about how if you don\'t want to date trans women, you\'re transphobic (Side note: why is the same argument rarely made for trans men?). Of course this post drew a lot of comments, half calling people transphobic while the other half argued that they aren\'t transphobic because they don\'t want to date trans women.\n\nThere was one heated comment thread in particular that caught my eye. Someone, let\'s call her ""Carly"", claimed that there were lots of passing transgender women out there and that chances are you may have even dated one and not know it! Someone said that was dumb, because unfortunately most transwomen don\'t pass. Carly boldly claims that most trans women pass and that lots of men don\'t find out that their partner is trans until they tell them about it. Carly then proceeded to tell various posters that there was a good chance they have slept with a trans woman *at least once in their life*.\n\nBut here\'s what gets me: aren\'t transgender a very teeny tiny minority group? Even if every single trans woman passed (which lets be honest, a lot don\'t), the chances of you randomly dating one are so remote, you\'d have a better chance at dating someone who was struck by lightning rather than a transgender woman. Yet Carly wouldn\'t stop talking as if trans people are everywhere. Worse, her comments had hundreds of likes and other people agreeing with her.\n\nAdded confusion: Carly had said in that SAME POST that transgender people are a small minority group, and as such face oppression. So which is it, Carly? Are they everywhere  or are they a teeny tiny minority group?\n\n(I don\'t know if this counts as ""peak trans"" since I already posted my peak trans moment, but it\'s definitely an argument that made me roll my eyes and further realize just how contradictory logic of trans women can be.)', 'Like most folks at college, I tend to be sympathetic to progressive causes.  When an ""out"" trans woman was assigned to my single-sex dorm (female), I thought nothing of it.  I honestly do not care what anyone has in their pants if they\'re in the bathroom/shower with me.  I\'m in one stall, they\'re in another, whatever.\n\nI lived on the same floor with her for a year, no issues.  Hung out with her on occasion.  She seemed nice enough.  She was kind of self-absorbed (most of our conversations were about her, non-stop) so I limited how often they happened (that shit gets draining).  Otherwise, no real red flags.\n\nWhen our Residential Life program solicited students to be Residential Assistants for their floors, she was the only applicant, so she got the job.  Now in a position of power, she felt free to demonstrate what a humongous narcissist she actually is.  I guess she felt invincible.  Sadly, she\'s probably right.\n\nThe situation came to a head when she verbally threatened another student with physical violence, on multiple occasions, in front of witnesses.  The incidents were reported to Residential Life.  They did nothing.  They did worse than nothing, actually.  They expressed doubt and disbelief.\n\nThat\'s peak trans for me.  Apparently, my college believes that nobody is more oppressed than a transgender person, and therefore if anyone lower on the intersectional hierarchy reports an attack by a trans person, that person does not deserve belief, assistance, or protection.\n\nThe transgender agenda, as currently implemented by my college, is misogyny.', ""So happy to have found this thread! I reached peak trans just over a year ago, when I was dating the most libfem girl you could ever imagine (long story incoming). Around 2 years into the relationship when she moved in with me she became very, very emotionally abusive - manipulating me by pointing out small 'flaws' in my body and features, telling me that she couldn't bear to watch me eat food because she found it so repulsive, controlling and policing my social life, then proceeding to force me to wear hyperfeminine make up/clothes I would never usually pick for myself to make me look, in her eyes, attractive. As she also adored riley j dennis and various lib trans activists; it slowly became clear she was not a lesbian like myself but a bi or possibly even straight woman who was attracted to a gross imitation of feminine stereotypes. She made me ashamed for my innate lesbian sexuality every day, telling me I need to 'unlearn' my genital 'preference'. I was very sad and confused; I lost a lot of self esteem, and a very unhealthy amount of weight, always trying to adhere to her standards. At the same time she became abusive I found out she had also been cheating on me for 6 months with a trans woman; she told me the pair of them had in fact planned to groom me into a three way sexual relationship (which I was obviously distraught and opposed to) - and I was apparently a 'terf' because of my reaction of horror to the whole situation. I wish this all not true, but this is honestly what happened to me - a traumatic ordeal but one that truly opened my eyes to the destructive, misogynist, gaslighting madness that is trans activism."", 'Hello, I\'m new here. This will be long. So, like many of you here, I used to be a supporter of ""trans rights"". I wanted to be kind and understanding, even if I didn\'t actually understand what trans-identified people claimed was irrefutable fact. I just figured ""well, it doesn\'t make sense to me, but live and let live, it doesn\'t hurt anybody!""\n\nI feel like I was lied to and that my empathic nature was taken advantage of by people who have no respect for my womanhood, my experiences, and my boundaries. \n\nI was told that trans-identified people had severe, debilitating gender dysphoria. That they couldn\'t live full, productive lives without having surgeries and taking hormones to imitate the opposite sex. That they are bound to commit suicide if they can\'t get estrogen medication, breast implants, and wear women\'s clothing. I was told I had to use female pronouns for males with gender dysphoria because it was a form of violence to acknowledge the reality of their male bodies. I was told it wasn\'t a mental illness.\n\nI didn\'t know about autogynephilia (men who masturbate to the idea of themselves as women, getting off on crossdressing, men wearing pads or putting tampons in their rectums for sexual gratification, getting boners when a stranger calls them ""ma\'am"", going to great lengths to induce ""lactation"" by using breastfeeding pumps and using various medications). I didn\'t know that they would insist that AGP is a fake, debunked conspiracy while admitting to watching sissy porn and hypno and exhibiting every trait of autogynephilia. (Gaslighting to the max)\n\nI didn\'t know about their obsession with trying to have ""girlgasms"".\n\nI didn\'t know they bragged about ""punching terfs"" and then actually assaulted women, including punching an elderly women in the face for being a said TERF.\n\nI didn\'t know that a trans-identified male expects me to be comfortable undressing, changing, and showering next to him because ""he\'s just one of the girls"". I also didn\'t know there are teenage trans-identifed boys who sue their high schools for not granting them access to the girl\'s change rooms, that there are trans-identified men who sue women who refuse to wax their genitals or let them into women\'s private pools/saunas.\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted to put trans-identified men in women\'s prisons, regardless of the threat and privacy violation this puts on women.\n\n I didn\'t know that many trans-identified people don\'t even have gender dysphoria AT ALL, they simply say that the pleasure they get from ""living as a woman"" is what makes them trans. That ""gender euphoria"" is a valid reason to identify as trans.\n\nI didn\'t know that they believe they have a female body simply because they have a ""laydee brain"", therefore their penis is a girldick/ladypeen/dicklet/large clit/clitty/\\*insert whatever other disgusting term they use here\\*. \n\n I didn\'t know they were delusional enough to believe they have periods-without-the-bleeding, while simultaneously insisting that women call themselves ""menstruators/bleeders/uterus havers"" because ""NOT ALL WOMEN HAVE PERIODS, TERF!""\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted to reduce mothers to ""birthing people/pregnant persons"".\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted lesbians to have sex with them.\n\nI didn\'t know they want to call sexuality a ""genital preference"", collectively erasing LGB people\'s sexualities.\n\nI didn\'t know that a significant portion of trans-identified males are creepily preoccupied by ""girlhood"" and having a fantasy that girls spend their time being called princess and having pillowfights at slumber parties.\n\nI didn\'t know that they believe they are entitled to go into a women-only space, even if they are ""pre-everything, in boymode"". \n\nI didn\'t know they wanted women who disagree with them to be choked, burned, or killed in some other violent fashion, while calling these women ""TERFS"" for daring to have boundaries and express dissent.\n\nI didn\'t know they were so narcissistic as to leave their wives and children to go pursue a womanhood they can never experience.\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted children to be allowed to take hormones, puberty-blockers, and have sterilizing surgeries, even when all statistical evidence shows that over 9 in 10 children with ""gender dysphoria"" outgrow it.\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted to take the resources of women for themselves; in women\'s shelters, women\'s scholarships, women\'s gatherings, women\'s leadership positions.\n\nI didn\'t know they wanted to destroy women\'s sports by competing in them and taking a female\'s spot for themselves.\n\nI didn\'t know how Big Pharma, rich old men in positions of power, and other clandestine groups and people have put a huge amount of money into popularizing transgenderism.\n\nI didn\'t know that when I took the time to look at pictures of trans-identified males online, that they all have the same strange look in their eyes that makes me extremely uncomfortable.\n\nI do know now.\n\nAnd that\'s why I\'m here.\n\nTL;DR: ""When I was a child, I thought like a child, but when I grew up I put away childish things."" I\'m not naive about transgenderism anymore. The rose-tinted glasses are off.', 'I peaked when I realized how many online feminist spaces had been lost the TRA movement. As a gay man who just couldn\'t stop reading Twisty Faster and checking Feministe for updates, I received tons of admonishment about how my perusal was welcome but my opinions unnecessary, and so I commented rarely. But as I sat by, refreshing these websites throughout the day, waiting for women to post radical feminist ideas in these spaces, ideas that I couldn\'t read anywhere else, because everywhere else needs to include MEN, and all the boring requirements of MALE centered worldviews and interactions and assumptions about what is true, and what is a fair way for women to talk and feel for MAN feelings, this weird thing happened where suddenly TIMs were leading the conversations, admonishing the women writing these blogs, and demanding to be centered in these spaces. I said nothing because I was still trying to let women have their voices, and the real women in charge of these spaces tried to be nice, and inclusive, and support the TIMs, until the TIMs had chased away all the real women, and there was nothing left for me to read, and the new radical feminist content stopped being posted, and these spaces became defunct.  \n\n\nI didn\'t realize they were just men who were so committed to invading women\'s spaces that they went full LARP about it, trying to co-opt everything they saw women doing, except for the part where they have interesting things to write about womanhood and women\'s liberation.  \n\n\nIn 2012 I would (and did) laugh at the idea that I should start a feminist blog myself. Clearly we didn\'t need another ""man talks about feminism"" website, because women were holding it down. Now I am feeling like it was all derailed and destroyed by the trojan trans movement, a sneaky trap that worked on far too many well meaning feminists and tricked them into letting in men to victimize their commentariat in the exact way they were trying to guard against.  \n\n\nIt all seems really unfair, and where before I was quiet because I wanted to give room to women to speak in their own spaces, now it seems like I need to be out there, loudly insisting that my fellow men stop dressing up like dollar-store drag queens, calling themselves women, and then being wicked aggro about it.', 'For me it really was as simple as being a lesbian, and knowing I was uncomfortable with the idea of dating transwomen, but I could never particularly say or pinpoint why, because I was scared of being called transphobic and not being able to contest that. \nEventually, as I found out more about what a ""terf"" was, I began hate-reading radfem/terf blogs on tumblr, and I found myself agreeing with a lot of what I was reading. It made sense and the more I looked critically at libfem arguments and statements, the more I saw the trans wave that was occuring, and the harm it was actively doing to women.\n I realized after a little while that being gender critical and protective of women wasn\'t being transphobic or misandrist, and that my discomfort with dating or having sex with a transwomen was completely validated, and not transphobic. The hate I received online after ""outing"" myself for my views only worked to solidify my stance. I\'m glad that this is where I stand now.', 'Just another peak. A friend of mine was told if she referred to her husband as ""husband, him, or he""  or by the name he had when they got married in divorce court she would be held in contempt of court. She was forced to lie in court. As in ""did you marry jennifer Smith on this date?"" She was forced to say yes, even though she married a man. \n\nAnd since gay marriage wasn\'t legal then, why are they even in divorce court? Why can\'t they just say it wasn\'t a valid marriage since it was two women? ', 'I hit peak trans after discovering how deeply misogyny underpins my friends\' genderspecial identities. \n\nSome context: These (all female) friends would, in a simpler time, just be called nerds. They\'re a little socially weird. They\'re not necessarily interested in conventional beauty standards and not romantically confident. A handful are bisexual but torn about pursuing women. (Which, as a lesbian, I fully get and don\'t want to dismiss.) \n\nAll of this has combined into pure, uncut old-school misogyny. Some examples: \n\n* Being nonbinary is just ""not like other girls"" on steroids, right? Because my friends who identify that way insist that they don\'t like lipstick and \\[insert stereotyped-as-frivolous piece of media here\\] and that\'s how they Knew All Along that their gender identity was different.   \n\n* Any woman they admire is automatically ""butch"" or ""gender nonconforming"" or ""they/them"" in their eyes. A lawyer in a skirt-suit with flowing hair and lipstick? Gender non-conforming bc she goes to court. A figure skater? Butch, because look at her muscles. It\'s like womanhood is only weakness, incompetence, and passivity in their view.   \n\n* ""She won\'t date me because I\'m trans,"" has become a really useful weapon. Suddenly, the pretty straight girls aren\'t just... straight. They\'re vile, toxic, abusive monsters, oppressing smol soft trans bois.   \n\n* In a frankly jaw-dropping conversation, a couple of them insisted that unwanted pregnancy is a horror unique to trans men because of the attendant dysphoria. What about women with no access to reproductive healthcare, you may ask? Eh, they\'re probably fine with it. Because having a fetus you don\'t want take over your body for nine months wouldn\'t provoke any complicated feelings, no ma\'am. \n\nThankfully, I\'ve never experienced physical violence or social ostracism from the trans community. My story is much less dire than many in these threads. But it\'s just so fucking exhausting and demoralizing to see young women hate themselves and other women, with an entire echo chamber of support around them. \n\n&#x200B;', 'I’ve been quietly on the fence for awhile. My partner identifies as trans. My partner is also physically abusive. I’ve tried to be understanding and supportive. I’ve tried not to let my partner’s bad behavior color my perception, even when I see parallels in their attitude and behavior and the attitudes and actions of trans activitists and their allies. I’ve tried to be the person I thought was right....\n\nBut peak trans is being told that “misgendering” is on par with almost a decade of their physical and emotional abuse towards me. Peak trans is knowing that if I tried to talk about this with anyone I currently consider a friend that they would probably agree, that I would probably be “called out” and/or canceled.\n\nPeak trans is knowing that an abusive man can just.... identify his way out of all that and if I raise my voice to shout back I’ll be see as the baddie.\n\nMaybe this will get buried. Maybe this will get shrugged off. But maybe someone in a similar place will see this and know she isn’t alone.\n\nJust know that not every handmaiden is laying down for all of this because she is happy to. Some of us have just gotten stuck.', 'I’ve been driven to this sub after seeing a billion comments on an r/actuallesbians post last night about “girldick” (aka trans penis). \n\nThe post itself was for straight men to stop telling lesbians that they “just haven’t had the right dick”. \n\nThe comments section immediately devolved into “girldick tho”, “everyone needs girldick”, about how trans woman dick has different “mouthfeel”, smell and taste than regular cis male dick, and so on. All of these comments were upvoted. Then they talked about how they had “clits” made for their reassignment surgeries, and went through the very detailed explanations of every anatomical thing you could think of. Like I’m a fucking lesbian, I worship vagina (lmao) and I feel like our identity is being **erased** by people. I don’t come on a lesbian subreddit to hear about how good “dick” is. Fucking puke.\n\nTo each their own, if some people like both dicks and vaginas that’s totally fine, but for an entire sub and comment section to be talking about how good and sexy “girldicks” are and have every single comment upvoted... I just feel like I don’t belong there.\n\nI’ve tried to be inclusive and understanding and open-minded, but that was the last straw. I wanna puke. I don’t wanna hear about how many months or hormone therapy someone needs to start “smelling” like a “girl” in their genitalia. That is just insane to me.\n\nEdit: Want to add that a comment was, “As a trans woman whose girlfriend is also trans, it’s fair to say that I like girldick.” Really? You and your significant other each have penises, and you call yourselves a lesbian couple? Wtf?\n', 'why the fuck do straight TIMs think it’s okay to say the word dyke/post on subs meant for wlw? 1) i’m certain they’ve never been called that slur, 2) they’re effectively straight men, 3) they’d probably feel validated as a “girl” if someone actually called them that. they’d be flattered. they have no idea what it means or feels like to be shamed for being a lesbian but they’re fine just co-opting language leveled against lesbians.', 'Some backstory for context. I have a genetic disorder. Hemophilia B, it\'s a hemorrhagic disorder characterized by a deficit of clotting factor IX (FIX). \\~40% functionality for me, which means I have a little less than half of what you would see in a typical person. It\'s inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that it predominantly affects male patients. I\'m female, and unusual in the sense that I\'m not just a female carrier, but have a full blown manifestation because of some real shitty genetic rolls. I have two broken copies of the gene on my X chromosomes rather than one.\n\nFemale carriers however, are partially effected, and may have symptoms of similarly excessive bleeding such as menorrhagia, when menstruation results in massive hemorrhaging rather than the typical teaspoonage. I suffer from this myself- and have lost consciousness from blood loss because of it before. Female carrier is the *medical term* used to describe women who have one abnormal copy of the gene that encodes for FIX, but typically their other copy on their other X chromosome will produce enough FIX that they may not be diagnosed until after a traumatic accident, surgery, childbirth, etc.\n\nFemale carriers have a certain chance of handing down the disorder- their sons are are a higher risk, and their daughters may similarly be carriers. In female patients, however, any and every biological son will have hemophilia, and their daughters will always be carriers (may be female patients depending on if they inherit a broken copy from their father.)\n\nHemophilia can be a devastating illness, and extremely expensive to treat- especially as I have the rarer subset of the disease, as Hemophilia A is more common and deals with a different clotting factor. Replacement therapy is the only real treatment now- purchasing vials of synthesized factor and injecting it on an ongoing (preferable) or need to basis. I have female relatives who have died in childbirth from hemorrhaging. I myself, have permanent physical deformities, primarily in my ankles and knees, that make walking difficult due to untreated bleeds. Essentially, the blood seeps into the lubricating fluid around joints and partially clots- sort of like grains of sand sawing away with movement. The inflammation response from your body drives more blood there, creating a positive feed back loop, and it is extremely painful. My knee injuries were the equivalent of being set on fire from the knee down. I still haven\'t healed properly from them, and it\'s been nearly a year. The best thing about it? I have spontaneous bleeds due to how low my levels are of FIX, and this isn\'t uncommon in moderate / severe severity levels of the disease. Common OTC pain relief like NSAIDs exacerbate bleeding, and outside of expensive injections, all I can do is grit my teeth and bear through my episodes.\n\nAll of this and more is why I refuse to have biological children. I would not condemn a child to a lifetime of agony for the sake of procreating. I am childfree, but I don\'t *hate* children. I look forward to being the fun aunt. That choice has been easier to make for me than most, as I have other factors influencing the fact I don\'t want to be a biological mother, or a parent in general: but this sort of disorder, and others like it, are why genetic counselling exists. It can be immensely difficult for women who do want to bear children, or who have even gotten pregnant before genetic testing, to realize what they may feel as if they\'ve done to their kids. It\'s devastating for women who *want* motherhood. No mother ever wants to feel as if she\'s hurt her child.\n\nI\'m always down to explain to people the particulars of my disorder if they\'re curious, or frightened (mostly because they think I\'m about to spout geysers of blood out of a papercut.) I don\'t mind. It\'s something I\'ve spent a lot of time educating myself on, and learning about- so as to be better able to communicate my needs and wants and also spread awareness of it. Many organizations and their help are targeted towards male patients- which makes sense, as they vastly make up the majority of cases.\n\nWhat does this all have to do with my peak trans moment?\n\nMy peak trans moment was having a TRA scream at me that I was being bigoted, and to stop talking about it, while I was politely explaining my disorder to a curious friend. Why? For daring to use the terms \'X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance\' and \'female carrier.\' For the term \'menorrhagia.\' That \'not all women menstruate and I was making them feel bad for it.\' For not being *inclusive.* That my *bodily functions* were inherently transphobic, and rather than female, I should use the term AFAB patient. Which... Means ""assigned female at birth."" It made no sense, whatsoever.\n\nIt was solely about policing me, as a woman, speaking about issues that impacted me as a woman.\n\nAs someone, who may have, in another life- desperately wanted to carry my biological child for 9 months and give birth. For whom the news at fourteen, that any child I would ever have would be devastatingly ill, and in all likelihood inherit even worse FIX functionality than I do, would have been life destroying, if I had wanted and assumed I could have kids when I grew up. I didn\'t want children. *Many women do.* And that struggle is intensely unique to the female experience- it is women who are pregnant. It\'s your mother\'s X chromosome that will determine if you are going to be a very sick little boy, with hemophilia. Or a sick little girl who will have to someday make that choice for herself. It\'s a daunting thing to look down the barrel of, especially when you\'ve reached the cusp of puberty- already an intensely confusing, frightening time, with the changes in a body that seems to betray you.\n\nThe destruction of female centric language in the context of medicine has always been a major gripe of mine- but there was no way I was going to stand by and passively support someone, or the movement they belonged to, who had the audacity to tell me, that the painful, debilitating disorder, that I live with every second of the day and every moment of the hour since I was born- that took away from me the ability to bear healthy children, was something I should be shamed and talked down to and de-platformed for.\n\nWomen\'s health matters.\n\nMy health matters.', 'Peak sex positivity on twitter, this has thousands of retweets\n\n>YOU KNOW WHAT\n>we need more MEN to come out and say, \n>""Hey I pay cam girls, fetish models, and I have a porn subsciption.

Lol.', 'Hello all! This is a lovely sub I\'ve been browsing for hours now. Made a throwaway reddit for this post, so here it goes.\n\nI identified as an FtM trans guy for years. I think this was largely due to abuse and trauma all throughout growing up, rebelliousness against parents, and being friends with almost only trans people. For a long time I truly believed I felt dysphoria (not sure about that considering I obviously no longer do), but I minded my business, didn\'t care if people called me ""she"" since I usually looked like a girl, and generally just wanted to pass as much as I could.\n\nI have had quite a few PTMs in this time. Two of the most significant ones (or friendships) built up. Not sure if everyone else in libfem circles secretly feels this way, but it was a load of shit when I said trans women are beautiful or valid or whatever just to not get witch hunted online. It was always a secret annoyance with how clearly trans ""women"" never appreciated the RIDICULOUS amount of support everyone constantly threw at them and spent all their time complaining. I donated clothes and makeup, listened to them vent, and I was ALWAYS repaid with complaints. It was never ending. I started becoming suspicious of TRA when I realized I\'d met 20+ TiMs and not one was pleasant at all, especially while every TiF was a caring and pleasant person. So it wasn\'t the transness. Anyways, my PTMs.\n\nOne was with my previous close friend, who is a TiM. One time we were talking with our other trans friend (an FtM that he dated), and the TiF and I discussed our experiences with misogyny. The TiM flipped his shit and started telling me he knew more about misogyny than we did, having identified as a ""woman"" for a few months and not transitioned at all. Even my trans self was DISGUSTED, and thankfully I shut him down and told him that I grew up a girl and ACTUALLY HAD EXPERIENCE dealing with sexism. He continued to make comments like this for the months we were friends. He said things like he was having a panic attack because I messaged a group chat before responding to his PM, talked about how hard being a dainty girl is (as a VERY masculine, tall, broad man), and more gross things. One time me and his girlfriend woke up early to plan a surprise birthday party for him, and worked all day. He sat on the couch and never once said thank you. As expected, he was obsessed with chokers, anime girls, and cutesy catgirl things. Was an antifeminist and very violent, luckily none of his other friends tolerated his shit. Cut him out.\n\nAnother was with a similar TiM, who was in the same friend group as above mentioned male. He claimed to be a trans woman because he was submissive and ""weak"". He later stole his mother\'s UNDERWEAR and BRAS to wear to feel ""authentic"". Also used her hairbrush as a sex toy. It was FOUL and I cut it off more quickly with him. He was a chronic liar, made misogynistic ""jokes"" constantly, and was a standard creepy male who fetishized women. Everyone quickly hated him and nobody brought him back when he soon realized it was a phase. Thank god.\n\nThat\'s my rant for now! I thank the universe that I decided to check out some radfem idealogy to try to round myself out and ended up ENTIRELY agreeing. I\'m thankful for no longer distancing myself from my natural and amazing womanhood, and I\'m thankful for being a normal person now. Cheers friends!', 'I’ve never really been a liberal feminist, I’ve always erred on the side of radical feminism. However, that said, I found myself swept up with the times, stopped focusing so much on feminism, and stepped away from it for a bit. \n\nBut recently with Jonathan Yaniv, def reached peak trans.  \n\nReached peak PEAK trans today listening to a YouTube debate with Contrapoints where he literally said “trans vaginas are exactly the same as women’s vaginas because they both do the same thing” referring of course to sex. His debater immediately (thankfully) jumped in and said “you really think the only thing a vagina exists for is sex?” Upon which Contapoints makes a gross face and exclaims childbirth and mensuration are both disgusting and why would anyone want those functions? \n\nIt just totally infuriated me. Here’s a man claiming to be a woman, saying that the only worthwhile function of a vagina is sex. And he CALLS HIMSELF A FEMINIST. Like? No. Just no. I’m so sick of the hatred for women, the pure misogyny from people like him who then dig the knife in even deeper by claiming the title feminist. Sorry but F OFF!!! \n\nThere’s a word for men who reduce women to their capacity for sex and that’s a douchebag, a woman hater, a misogynistic asshole. That word is NOT feminist. Don’t you dare tell me the only function and purpose for a vagina is sex. That’s beyond insulting and I’m so tired of hearing it. I don’t even like or want kids, and I do not enjoy my periods anymore than anyone does, but both of these things make me female and are the center point of my experience as a woman. My vagina’s capacity to pleasure a man is not even in the top 50 crucial points of my existence as a human female. It’s such a male way to think of the feminine. And yet now suddenly, if I, as a natal woman, do not “center” that viewpoint, I’m the asshole?! \n\nI’m over it. Done. Not playing this game anymore. My mother was a bra burning second wave feminist and I grew up reading books on the divine feminine, about the power of the goddess. Books about the power and glory of being female. That is what feminism is and always will be to me. Not some sexist douche in makeup telling me what purpose my vagina was created to serve. I serve no man, my experiences will center on no man, and my power in this world will not hinge on any man’s approval. \n\nSorry for the rant, I’m just so heated. To hear a “feminist” actually believe the sole function of a vagina is sex. WTF world are we in?! ', 'One of the most shocking things I\'ve realized is just how protected transgenderism is becoming. \n\nThere are subreddits depicting women getting peed on and raped, visibly suffering and with emptiness in their eyes. But where are the true hateful subreddits? The ones in which people say ""transwomen are male"". You know, a fact. \n\nThere is also violent porn allowed on Twitter. That\'s totally fine! But if you live in England and are an elderly woman who makes anti-transgenderism tweets? Then you get reported to the police!\n\nI guess this ""re-peaked"" me. This is all fucking insane. ', 'I’ve been visiting this reddit for a few months now, and I have to say I am so relieved to find a group of women I can find solace in, and who share my views. I finally created an account to post my peak trans.\n\nI’ve had a few over the years (I was actually in a long-term relationship with an incredibly abusive TIM - emotional and financial abuse, sexual coercion - I am healing though, with the help of radical feminism).\n\nAnother experience last year really unnerved me though. In public on my lunch break, headphones in etc, was approached by an older (50-60), very burly and quite frankly, massive TIM who just started rambling at me about how beautiful I am, how I was his ideal “look”, and how he cannot wait to look like me. He was in ridiculous clothing ofc, heels, a very short pleated school skirt, caked on makeup, and was wearing a ridiculous long purple wig. He kept calling me sweetie and darling, and his comments got more and more inappropriate. He told me how he was a lesbian, and how if I was his girlfriend he would protect me - not fucking kidding. He explicitly stated how his penis doesn’t work anymore, and he’s just like a real “girl”, but then kept asking me about my period. He also kept telling me we’re sisters who have to stick together. Ugh.\n\nI finally get away after about an hour, the whole time I pretty much said nothing (I’m in my early twenties, and I’m very petite, this man scared me) but now every so often this man sees me around, and actively seeks me out - it’s happened about 4 or 5 times now. Every time he gets more explicit, commenting on my breasts, how “skinny” I am (I’m recovering from anorexia!), and showing me his new tattoos (of naked women and venus symbols). One time, he actually switched from his incredibly infantilised “female voice” to his real, natural male voice, and it was terrifying.\n\nI am lucky enough now that I have girlfriends who know this guy seeks me out in my area, and will warn me where he is, or at least keep an eye out. I know these men exist obviously, but coming into contact with them in real life is upsetting and scary. I genuinely do feel unsafe and targeted by them. These men don’t see women as people, we’re just a dress up game and fetish to them.', ""I hit peak trans back in November when I was doing poll-greeting for the Democratic Party in a semi-rural and somewhat conservative district. I was very clear that the point of my being there was to hand out voting guides to try to win elections, period. One of the other Democratic Party volunteers was a TIM who spent the entire time making a spectacle of himself. I have rarely seen a TIM who was so obviously a man-in-a-dress and the sort of person who instantly comes across as batshit-crazy on any number of levels. I thought about it afterwards: Was there any way in which this guy even remotely resembled a woman other than wearing a dress? His whole manner was male. He would loom over people very aggressively and speak very loudly, not just like a man, but the kind of jerk who seems not to understand other people's personal space. His manner of speaking and body language were totally male. You could tell when he walked up to people that they just sort of went blank, not knowing quite what he was or how to respond. And he constantly tried to find ways to talk about himself as being trans -- as if we didn't notice. Moreover, in a situation like that where you are a public representative of an organization, you have to understand your relationship to your audience. I played my part and dressed professionally, trying to speak to people cordially without stepping on people's toes -- while he was getting in people's face and freaking them out. You don't win votes by alienating your target audience. \n\nAnd I still don't get it. I'm a gay man (which I did not announce to anyone because it wasn't relevant), and I've known gay men with some very feminine mannerisms. What I don't understand is how a guy who walks, talks, and comports himself *like a man* imagines that he magically becomes a woman by putting on a dress, announcing the fact, and expecting everyone to take it seriously.  "", 'Sorry, this got kind of long, but I hit peak trans only a few days ago and this is the first time I can talk about it freely. \n\nEven when I supported trans activists, there were a lot of things that they did or said that bothered me, but I didn\'t want to admit it. There was a sort of vicious cycle at work: I would feel guilty for having ""transphobic"" thoughts, which\'d lead me to seek out trans stuff (articles, scientific evidence, books, movies) to ""educate myself"", but then I found all that stuff nonsensical at best and harmful at worst, which made me feel even more guilty... I hit peak trans after reading that story about the woman who had to leave a shelter because she didn\'t want to room with a trans woman. Most of the comments on the story were people blaming her for being a bigot, a transphobe, the usual stuff. For some reason this story was the straw that broke the camel\'s back. \n\nAll the previous things which I found questionable about trans ideology came back to me. I never believed in gender, but I did believe that trans people were harmless and that there was no need to upset them. I believed their claims about oppression, about how life was so much harder for them than for us. I felt so bad for them. I wouldn\'t have admitted it only a week ago, but I think the main reason for which I felt so much for them was because I essentially viewed them as severely mentally ill people. TERF\'s were the bad guys in this scenario, because they were harrassing troubled people who posed no threat whatsoever.\n\nThe story about the trans woman in a woman\'s shelter completely changed the way I saw things. Going along with people\'s delusions does pose a threat - in this case, a threat to women\'s safety. Even if trans women were all kind, well-meaning people, what prevents a predatory man from pretending he\'s a trans woman to have access to women\'s spaces ? And how could all trans women be kind, well-meaning people when a good part of them were constantly acting like their feelings were more important than women\'s safety ? \n\nI tried to search for more stories of these types, to see if it was a one-off, and found so many more of them, as well as ridiculous stuff like men winning a woman\'s competition, sexual offenders being accepted into women\'s prisons... The good thing about all of this is that I also found this sub, and realised that I was a radfem all along without knowing it - feminism that doesn\'t try to play nice with men and pretend that prostitution and porn are empowering is exactly what I\'ve always wanted. And I finally feel free to say that no, a man putting on a dress is not a woman.', 'As a black immigrant, I hate how TRAs assume that anyone who disagrees with them is a white TERF or white conservative. I (and it seems many black women) disagree with this ideology and I *hate* how they claim that their oppression is the same as racialized oppression. For trans people, their specific trans-based oppression comes when they are discovered to be trans. So if they pass as ""cis"" (whether that is based on their sex or as their gender i.e. a TIM not outing themselves and being seen as either 100% male or female or a TIF being seen as 100% female or male) then they don\'t have to fear their specific trans-based oppression. Think of it like a horseshoe, with the two ends representing passing as either female or male and being safe while the curved part is the dangerous part.\n\nAs a medium-dark black woman, there is no horseshoe for me. I can\'t ever pass as white (nor would I want to) and there is no safety in being seen as black.\n\nSo if trans person can pass as their sex (even if it causes them discomfort, there is no lasting physical issues) or their opposite gender (which they want), then they are fine. But the only way I can escape racialized oppression is by passing as white (which causes discomfort *and* physical issues). There is no equivalence.\n\nBut wait, there\'s more.\n\nTRAs claim that their ""fight"" for trans rights are equivalent to the Civil Rights Movement. 😒.\n\nBlack people weren\'t even seen as people and had to fight for the right to vote, to go to good and normal schools, to marry whoever they want, to escape the likely poverty they\'d be born into due to slavery/sharecropping, etc. Now I personally do not have a problem with people who are trans and understand that some people are discriminated against (actual discrimination like being fired or being evicted) due to them being trans. And TRAs should fight for those rights.\n\nBut trans people are seen as human. They go to normal schools. They can marry whoever they want. They aren\'t likely to be born into poverty due to systemic discrimination.\n\nExpecting to be called by their preferred pronouns all the time is not a right. Validation by requiring people to change their **sex**uality for them is not a right. Making life-changing and possibly permanent medical decisions for oneself as a minor is not a right.\n\nThe modern TRA ""fight"" for trans rights requiring everyone to agree that TIMs are 100% equal to women and TIFs are 100% equal to men (but yet somehow face more discrimination as a TIM/TIF??🤔) and deserve access to the same physical spaces, to sex-discriminated sports, to be seen as such in a romantic/sexual relationship and anyone who might respectfully disagree even a little bit is deemed a bigot and threatened, harassed, and/or deplatformed is insane. And to say that this ""fight"" is equivalent to the Civil Rights Movement is nonsensical and frankly insulting.\n\nTRAs: stop claiming/comparing yourself to a black person and their struggles. Fight for the actual discrimination that you face.\n\n**TLDR:** All people that disagree with TRAs aren\'t white feminists or white conservatives. Every person of color does not agree with TRAs. Trans oppression and fight for rights is not even close to being the same as what black people face/have faced. Actually fight against the discrimination that you face instead of attacking people who rationally disagree with you.\n\nSide note: I\'m kind of hesitant about posting this on GC because I\'m not exactly radfem (I\'m not libfem either) and don\'t necessarily have the same exact viewpoint as the majority here seem to have with respect to trans people.

I live in a conservative state and my small town doctor was recently absorbed by a regional health care agency (? I don\'t know what you call it, basically a big name hospital with clinics all over the US bought up my doctor). Because of this new merge, they changed the way the office looks and also changed their databases. Because of the database change, patients had to fill out paperwork even if they were an existing patient (like myself).\n\nAnyway, I was filling out my paperwork when under the ""sex"" option was ""pronouns"". They listed ""He/She/They"". It\'s so stupid. I didn\'t fill mine out because I already put my sex down. \n\nOne  small funny thing happened though, there was someone else filling out their paperwork near by.

"", '[deleted]', 'I\'ve been lurking here for months, taking in the information and slowly deprogramming my mind after years in the libfem genderist trenches as someone who identified for almost two decades as genderqueer. For years, I accepted, on faith, the cherrypicked studies of my community. I tried to stifle the voice in my head that told me that the ""lesbian"" trans ""women"" I knew were acting just like entitled heterosexual men. I made excuses for their behavior. After all, back then, some of them still admitted they\'d had male socialization. I ignored that they were, to a man, narcissistic flakes who never gave a shit about anyone else\'s problems but their own. To do otherwise, obviously, would be transphobic and of course no one wanted to be that.\n\nSometimes, women friends and I, when one-on-one, would say things like, ""I could never say this in public without being tarred as transphobic, but..."" and talk about our discomfort with behaviors we\'d noted, but that was about all. We knew our concerns would be silenced and we\'d be the ones punished for even questioning the womanhood of these people.\n\nI think I was slowly peaking. Then my daughter, my lovely, quirky, kind, anxious, possibly autistic, certainly ADHD, previously proud to be female, scared of being ostracized (even in our very liberal city ) for liking girls daughter, entered middle school and, like so many kids, like more than half of her female friends (something I didn\'t know for months), started to question her gender.\n\nIt baffled me. It baffled every person who knew her well. But of course, I\'d been trained to believe that everyone who claimed to be trans was trans. That gatekeeping was bad. All that nonsense we\'re sold when we want to be good little progressives. I spent a lot of time crying at the thought of my little girl rejecting her girlhood, her past, even her name that she once loved so much she tried to get us to name all the pets with it.\n\nMeanwhile, none of my friends seemed to see anything strange about the rise of girls identifying as boys. People felt more comfortable coming out, after all. Why weren\'t boys coming out at the same rate? Oh, it\'s easier for girls. There was no questioning, even with people who should have known better, should have known that the numbers and clusters indicated that there was something strange going on.\n\nThank god, though, that one day, one of the trans-identified people I followed on Twitter angrily posted that there was no such thing as ROGD. And thank god that, the one radfem I knew, I hadn\'t rejected when she refused to call a TIM she.\n\nI found 4th Wave Now. I started reading Feminist Current through different eyes (before, I\'d read it trying to find holes in the arguments my friend linked to there). I started digging into the actual science behind gender identity. To my shame, I realized that the radfems were the ones with the receipts and the stronger scientific case.  And to my benefit, I realized that my inability to properly conform to gendered expectations didn\'t mean I wasn\'t a woman, at which point, my vague and sporadic dysphoria dissipated.\n\nPerhaps if this hadn\'t happened to my child, I never would have peaked and I\'d still be in my comfortable libfem bubble. But it did and I have and I feel like I\'ll never feel comfortable or happy again. My daughter still fluctuates between identities. She\'s been feeling like a girl for weeks, but yesterday she brought that awful book on parenting transgender children home from school. A TIF friend there had loaned it to her.  I\'m furious. I have no recourse, which makes it worse. I know my child and I know what makes her dig in her heels, so I have to be careful what I say around her. I just do what I can. Educating her on sex-based oppression is something I can do, reminding her that puberty is a time of change and no one has to have anything figured out as a teen is another thing I can do, as is reassuring her that I will always love her, no matter what. I can support her same-sex attraction and give her books on (actual) lesbian history. I can remind her that her body will always be female, no matter what.\n\nI don\'t know how this will end. Obviously, I wish it had never started. It\'s probably taken a few years off my life at this point. I can\'t speak my mind in real life with anyone other than a small, trusted group. I\'d lose most of my support network and my career connections if they knew what I believe: that gender is a structure designed to oppress women on the basis of sex, that transitioning children is morally wrong, and that ideology has replaced evidence when it comes to the treatment of people with gender dysphoria to the harm of us all.\n\nI will add, to those who I know get frustrated with we who are just coming around and having our eyes opened to it all, that once you see that the radical feminists have the weight of truth on their side when it comes to modern gender ideology, you start to wonder what else they\'re right about. I\'ve gone from years of thinking ethical pornography and prostitution were possible to a believer in the Nordic Model in under a year. I keep Dworkin on my Kindle.

No one else has our backs but us.', '[deleted]', 'I can\'t say there was one point where I hit peak trans, because there have been many, but I\'d say the ""cotton ceiling"" did me in. I\'m a TiF, and although I am 100% aware that I\'m female, will always be, and identify as a lesbian, I don\'t have any intention of de-transing, which I\'m sure most on this board would not agree with. And that\'s okay. It is valid to see what I did as the coward\'s way out, because honestly, I transitioned partly to alleviate dysphoria and partly because I vastly prefer the ""invisibility"" that being read as male gives me. Do I wish we lived in a world where female bodies weren\'t sexualized and controlled by men? Absolutely. Would I have transitioned if we did? Maybe not. But I saw the chance to opt out of the male gaze and fetishizing of lesbians I experienced nonstop as a ""soft butch"" and my life has, sadly, been much easier for it.\n\nAll that to explain my perspective going into the trans ""community"" and how I wound up hitting peak trans. I must\'ve been living under a rock, because I actually expected that I would encounter other TiFs like me, who identified as lesbians and transitioned because society accepts trans men a hell of a lot more than GNC lesbians. Oh boy, was I wrong. From square one, I got flamed for still identifying as homosexual, only having a ""preference"" for female partners, and not jumping on board with the ridiculous claim that I was actually ""socialized as a trans male"" my whole life and therefore have not actually been experiencing misogyny all these 32 years, but in fact am a perpetuator of ""straight toxic masculinity."" It also struck me as odd that every other thread in the trans support boards seemed to be titled some variation of ""I\'m a gay trans boy, will anyone accept me??"" and I got constant shit for not ""turning gay"" on Testosterone, which I guess is supposed to be some rite of passage now? They go on and on about the toxicity of the ""not trans enough"" mentality, but if you\'re a TiF who remains exclusively attracted to females, you get the side eye and everyone acts like you\'re closeted at best, or just ""not evolved enough"" to have sex with males. Same old homophobia, exciting new branding.\n\nI realized very early on there was no place for people like me in the trans community, unless we kept our mouths shut. The fact that I refuse to worship the porn industry and consider prostitution to be an inherently misogynistic system that oppresses women rather than a super empowering career choice was equally unforgivable. I\'m sure only GC folks will appreciate the irony of transitioning to ""get away"" from female-based oppression only to find that surprise, the ""community"" enforces the same tired standards that tell females to sit down and shut up about our opinions because our problems are all in our head. AMABs are the ones who REALLY have it hard, even though I started noticing that almost everyone I encountered through general trans communities had a few things in common: transitioned late in life, lived as VERY masculine men before coming out, usually in a tech field or something equally lucrative, and identified as lesbians after transitioning. But because they had magically been ""socialized as women"" and we had been ""socialized as men,"" we somehow had privilege they didn\'t.\n\nThe TiFs around me were struggling with typical female oppression, while having to preempt every post with a ""confession"" of their male privilege and how they know they have it ""so much easier than trans women."" I started noticing that every time one of us would post something about TiF-specific dysphoria, the other side would come on and say ""Ugh, how could you not be happy being a girl??"" Or ""You were so pretty before! What a waste!"" The double standard was that TiFs had to apologize for existing (sound familiar?) and constantly downplay and question the reality of our own experiences, especially as they related to experienced misogyny. Meanwhile, they were allowed to have MTF-only spaces, but God forbid one of us wanted to talk about female medical problems or just general experiences with transition without making it about the community in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone who grew up in a very religious environment, all of the newspeak and shushing started to feel like I was out of the frying pan and into the fire. These days, I have little to no interaction with the ""community"" and my mental health is better for it. Sorry for the long post, this is just the first time I\'ve felt able to share these experiences without being told I\'m crazy or a misogynist (?). I\'m sure there\'s a lot of understandable frustration toward people like me in this community, but maybe take some comfort in knowing that those of us who transition have to deal with these people on a daily basis, and it is as exhausting as it seems?\n\nEdited: typo.', 'I know this sub should ideally be a space for women primarily. I am a gay man and I find myself drawn to the rad fem movement as I agree with lots of the principles you represent.\n\nI have grown up with very strong women around me who are engineers, chemists and Doctors. All formidable women who had to be twice better than their male counterparts to get whether they are. Hence where I am coming from.\n\nI experienced peak trans twice recently. One was when a straight TIF felt it was ok to voice their dissatisfaction with gay men who don’t want to date or have sex with them. They called it transphobic and regressive. I am sorry but I prefer men and that usually means the anatomical structures attached to them. This is not transphobia!!\n\nThe other was watching the Louis Theroux documentary about trans kids. Made my skin boil as I have experienced things they portrayed as being trans (playing with dolls, wearing my sisters dresses, etc). I was upset that had I been born on the wrong side of trans wokeness I would have pigeonholed into being a trans kid. I am very much male and I am very happy with who I am.\n\nI find the whole concept of strict gender stereotypes extremely regressive. It also potentially constitutes erasure of healthy expressions of gender such as flamboyant men and butch women. Why are we stepping back instead of forward? \n\nIMHO if someone wants to present whichever way you want, then they should go ahead. No hate at all and all the support from me.\n\nBut being a TIM or TIF is that! they’re not a man or a woman.

Such reality denial"", 'My peak trans was back in 2012, I think. I was 12 at the time, and just getting into the whole ""feminism"" thing, mostly through social media. I was hanging out in the most popular russian-speaking community of liberal feminists at the time. I would mostly accept things, but some things were just... debatable.\n\nI remember the exact picture that sparked my interest in a different point of view.\n\nIt was the whole social ladder - with transwomen of colour being at the very bottom, of course. The picture was an illustration for an article, and there was that phrase most of you are familiar with - ""to be a woman means to feel like one"".\n\nAnd it didn\'t make any sense to me.\nI never ""felt like a girl"" in my normal life. The time when I was reminded of my sex was always painful. I ""felt like a girl"" when getting chased by drunk men wanting to ""get to know me"". I ""felt like a girl"" when I would get chastised for not wearing skirts. I ""felt like a girl"" when I would wake up to a bloody bedsheet after starting my period.\n\nIt wasn\'t something inside of my head. It was outside of my control. It was my body, and everything that people wanted to do with it.\n\nI couldn\'t understand how something like that could be a pure feeling that people could choose to get in and out of.\n\nI saw somebody ask similar questions in the comments. They were silenced and deleted within minutes.', 'I followed a TIM on social media for a few months, just out of curiosity. In that time, he said that gossip is more enjoyable when you\'re on HRT, that being cat-called made him feel awesome and that he wanted to get SRS in order to take selfies in lingerie, among other things. To put it in a few words, it was all about looking sexy and sticking to harmful stereotypes.\n\nI always hated all the expectations that are forced upon us just for being born female. Seeing him playing along with it and treating ""womanhood"" as if it were a game (while other TIM praised him for that) made my blood boil.

And I keep coming across him posting on reddit as a woman on communities I used to feel safe in, and now they just feel...violated.

But if I were  to point this out, I'd be the transphobic asshole? Am I the crazy one here?!\n\nIt's exhausting guys. If you asked me a year ago if I'd be feeling such contempt for a trans person, I would have been so offended.

I\'ve been reading here for a while, but that peaked me into active participation. \n\nEvery trans person I knew in the 90\'s was born a gay man. I don\'t care if people want to live as the opposite sex, or however else they want, as long as they\'re not hurting anyone. But trans ideology is hurting women now and that\'s not okay. I\'m also concerned about the number of teenaged girls I know who identify as boys. ROGD is real, I know, because I\'ve watched it happen with my daughter\'s friends. \n\nI first peaked with the pussy hats. I was at the DC march and it was an incredible experience to be surrounded by so much female energy. (I\'m now outspokenly against the Women\'s March organization, however.) It\'s absurd in every way that a hat is transphobic. They\'re a visual pun with the cat ears, for one, and to use TRA\'s language and logic against them, pussy is a word for female genitalia and if your girldick is female, it can be called a pussy. I don\'t believe that a penis is female, but the argument against the pussy hat makes no sense by their own logic. It\'s ridiculous.\n\nI was once called out for saying that douche is acceptable insult for a man because douches are heavily marketed to but ultimately bad for women. I was informed that I was being transphobic because, and I\'m paraphrasing, pseudo-vaginas require frequent douches therefore they are medically necessary for women. Um, no. That\'s when I realized TRA\'s are actively erasing the lived experiences of women. \n\nSo I\'m done.

I didn’t question their logic at all. I mindlessly followed their ‘trans women are women’ brigade. People who didn’t follow this new truth? Evil TERFs! Burn in hell TERFs! Do your part, punch a TERF today!\n\nI had to see what these evil, awful people were saying. And I just couldn’t believe it. Logic about biology? Safe spaces for victims of male abuse? The fact that lesbians don’t want to be involved with a penis?\nAlso, my god, the sheer violence that was directed at these ’TERF’ people! And it was okay to say that?!\nThey’re lumping people into this TERF category who so much as whisper, *’Hey, maybe trans women shouldn’t be allowed in delicate female-only spaces...’* or *’Hey so, I’ll respect your decision to live how you want but you’re still biologically male and will always be...’*\n\nThe nerve! The outrage! TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN! They should be allowed to go into wherever they choose to go! Forego the privacy or comfort of **’cis’** women. Only trans women know the real struggles of womanhood. Those brave, beautiful women.\nForget that some of them have a fetish for dressing up as women. Forget that there’s documented cases of men posing as women to get access to women/girls in safe spaces, to harm or sexually harass them. Forget those people, they’re not really trans. Then who is trans? What’s the metric to measure transness?\nWho knows?! But it’s totally okay because trans women are real women! Full stop! No questions asked! (You better be okay with that 100% or guess what? You’re a TERF!)\n\nI realise that not every trans person is like that. It’s an extreme case. But the more I saw, the more disgusted at the behaviour I became. The fact that anyone who had a differing opinion in the slightest was labelled a bigot worthy of violence against them.\nThe ‘TERFs’ I saw never posted anything violent. They never said trans people should die. They never begged their ‘TERF’ friends to gear up with baseball bats and wander around threateningly.\nOn Tumblr, there was a blog that kept posting anti-TERF messages. Out of curiosity, I went to their main page. Oh... my... god. There were dozens of pictures of mutilated bodies and corpses, all with various **”Kill TERFs”** captions. I was nearly sick.\n\nSo, I found the GenderCritical subreddit. I read what everyone here had to say. I read the reactions by the trans brigade. I saw the various stats of children being referred to gender clinics had gone up in crazy amounts. I saw the detransitioners. I saw the push for *’Trans women are women’*, with nothing about trans men being mentioned. Why? Because they’re women. And men want to dominate women and their spaces, as much as they can. In any way they can. And if they have to ‘become women’ to do it, they will.\n\nI know there are people with genuine gender dysphoria and I feel for them. I can’t imagine their pain and confusion. But anyone who presents as trans have either of these two things:\n- A mental disorder\nor\n- Been socially brainwashed\n\nThe trans community have such high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide. No-one doubts that. The trick is to find a professional to treat that. If it involves hormones and surgery, that’s your choice to make.\nBut **do not** inject yourself into spaces where you would make others fear for their safety.\nAs a woman, I have been naturally fearful of men for most of my adult life. I know plenty of wonderful men, but there is always the question of ‘what if’ he is one of the *bad* ones. Most violence is perpetrated by men. Most rape is perpetrated by men. Do I wish my gut instinct wasn’t fear? Sure. But it is. And if a male (trans woman) was suddenly in a space that I thought was private for women, I’m on edge immediately. I can bet 80-90% of the time, nothing would happen. But on the off chance...\n\nI could go on.

I also generally support trans people, at least as far as wanting to be treated fairly and live free from violence and discrimination.  But some of the stuff that has been going on has gone way past the point of sanity.\n\nSome of the stuff that has convinced me that the trans movement has completely jumped the shark:\n\n*  male-bodied people competing in women\'s sports.\n* the ongoing ""JY"" saga.\n* the ban of Meghan Murphy and the demonizing of people who voice concerns about women\'s safety in the face of the push to open up locker rooms and showers and rape shelters to male-bodied people.\n* the British rapist being transferred to a women\'s prison and various accounts of predatory men gaining access to vulnerable women by claiming to be trans.\n* the ""cotton ceiling"".

But before I read about any of that, what really set me off was when I read that colleges are cancelling ""The Vagina Monologues"" because it\'s ""not inclusive"".  I couldn\'t believe it.  The idea that women talking about their bodies and their experiences was a bad thing now because it makes trans people feel excluded is what pushed me off the bandwagon.  The Vagina Monologues was important and empowering and liberating for a generation of women... but now we\'re shutting it down because it makes some tiny group feel ""excluded""? That\'s a travesty.

But although I won\'t be posting here under my main account, I will use my main account to challenge ridiculous trans talking points if the opportunity presents itself.\n\n&#x200B;', ""This is a long one, but I peak-transed a couple of months ago, and since then I've had a whirlwind of revelations and emotions and I haven’t yet found a real-life group to vent to!\n\nI've always been socially liberal, always supported gay rights etc. so my instinct was to support trans rights too. My dad cross-dresses, and one of his cousins is transsexual and transitioned 40 years ago.\n\nI even wrote a lengthy and cringingly sanctimonious answer on Quora about 5 or 6 months ago about how I would not care \\*at all\\* if a trans woman came into a public bathroom while I was in there because I'm so cool and all that (which I’m considering deleting).\n\nBut a series of things led up to my peak-trans moment. \n\nFirstly I started hearing vaguely in newspapers about all these veteran feminists being banned from talking at universities for being “bigoted transphobes”, which I thought was kind of odd - like, was it old age or something? But I didn’t look into it much. Then I became a member of the UK Labour Party, and again, in our local facebook group there were a few older women getting angry about trans issues, which made me vaguely wonder why a supposedly leftwing person would be so bigoted and mean to a vulnerable minority.\n\nAt the first Labour Party meeting I went to there was a man (6’, fairly hench, lots of stubble) who had long hair and was wearing men’s trousers and work boots, with a floral dress over the top. I thought it was cool that he felt comfortable dressing however the hell he liked. A couple of months later I heard he’d got violent at a meeting and had to be forcibly removed. Then I saw him leave a post on the local party facebook group that started “As a woman…” and I just thought wtf, you cannot be serious, this guy can’t even be bothered to shave, how is he in any way a woman?! But I put it down to a one-off guy with mental problems.\n\nA little later, one of my oldest and dearest friends from childhood told me (via facebook) that he identifies as a lesbian now and how shitty and scummy “TERFs” are. I just typed supportive-sounding stuff, but I was literally crying with laughter. That sounds mean typing it but this guy is quite narcissistic, and to me there is nothing womanly about him at all, physically or mentally. He also said he has no intention of changing anything about his appearance or lifestyle, so in other words his womanliness is nothing more than a feeling in his head that I have to accept just because. After that conversation he didn’t mention it again, so I just chalked it down to too much weed or something. But then a mutual friend told me she’d had the same conversation with him, and that she’d actually got annoyed with him and told him he can never know what it’s like to be a woman, or be treated as a woman, and that by being male and presenting as male he benefits fully from male privilege whilst pretending to be disadvantaged, and that's insulting to women. I think that’s what planted the seed that told me it’s OK for a young, left-wing person with progressive views to not be 100% on board with this whole transgender thing…\n\nThen I read about a pre-op transman in Canada who was upset with a blood donation clinic who had asked her if she had been pregnant in the past however many months, which she was furious about, because TRANS MEN ARE MEN. The clinic stated that the reason they have to ask is because some pregnant women have a certain type of antibody that can make recipients of their blood very sick (and obviously someone with a vagina and uterus could have been pregnant for all they know). So essentially this person thought their right to pretend to be male (whilst keeping her uterus and vagina) was MORE IMPORTANT than a sick person’s health. That gave me a massive nudge towards the peak.\n\n Then I got Twitter, and discovered a whole community of gender-critical feminists, where I 100% peaked after finding out about:\n\n\\-children being put on hormones with very little scrutiny\n\n\\-Karen White\n\n\\-JY WaxMyBalls\n\n\\-Rachel McKinnon (then Hannah Mouncey, Fallon Fox)\n\n\\-the cotton ceiling\n\n\\-Alex Drummond, of Stonewall, [who is literally a man in drag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=argNVR5HVgE&), saying he is a woman and “expanding the bandwidth of what it means to be a woman” like gee, thanks mate, we were struggling with that before you came along to solve it for us!\n\n\\-the fact that around 80% of trans men have no surgery, and are therefore LITERALLY men in drag\n\n\\-the whole ideology about gender “feelz” being more important than biology\n\n\\-people sincerely saying biological sex is a construct\n\n\\-anybody who even slightly questions the whole ideology being written off as a “bigot”, straight off the bat, often by left wing people I used to respect, without even addressing the arguments\n\n\\-when you stop accepting the mantra TWAW, and start seeing a trans women for what they are, men, you realise how much most of this is just the same old misogyny, the same old patriarchy as always, under a different guise.

Men (woke bros) telling women to shut up and not be silly, and let the men (transwomen) speak. \n\n\\-Realising that all of those mean, nasty, bigoted “TERFs” were actually simply saying things that most people would have automatically accepted as common sense 10 years ago… and that they are NOT “anti-trans” at all, they are simply pro-woman!\n\nTo top it all off, JY got me a 12 hour ban from Twitter, shortly followed by a 7 day ban for correctly-gendering him.

So my multiple peak trans moments were:\n\n\\- Finding out that lesbians are being bullied into having sex with male-born people who are now calling themselves 'lesbians.'\n\n\\- Finding out that 70% of trans men (I refuse to call them women) keep their penis.\n\n\\- I saw a Sky News report that showed calm, educated, committed feminists in their older years be physically and verbally assaulted by violent TRAs when they were trying to access their places of work or women's groups. These TRAS were wearing scarves hiding their faces.\n\n\\- Learning that male-born people are now are being let into women's prisons, domestic violence shelters, women's changing rooms just because they 'say they are now a woman.'\n\n\\- Finding out that feminists have been banned from twitter for even wanting to discuss these issues which affect the whole of society.\n\n\\- Finding out that a women's rights group who hired a billboard to show the dictionary definition of a woman had their billboards taken down within hours because apparently the dictionary definition of what a woman is is 'offensive.'\n\n\\- Finding out that feminists are getting silenced and de-platformed by TRAS, silencing women's voices.\n\n\\- Finding out that children are now being sent for gender related counselling and being encouraged to identify as trans, take 'puberty blockers' and encouraged to have surgery on their bodies.\n\nI literally can't get my head around all of this. I've been reading about it for the past few days and I feel like I'm living in some kind of Orwellian, dystopian nightmare."", 'This is not precisely my peak trans but paid a definite role in me realizing some shit.\n\nA few years ago I spent a couple weeks volunteering at a farm during the summer, or WWOOFing. It\'s part of a worldwide network of farms that welcome informal volunteers, house them and feed them, and in exchange they work on the farm. It\'s generally city-dwellers and hippy-oriented people who want to learn more about life on the countryside who do this.\n\nAs a solo female traveller, I looked for places that seemed safe for me, so I chose farms whose profiles were written by women, to ensure that there would be at least a female owner at the farm at the time of my visit (and not find myself stuck with only men in such a vulnerable position). I applied to several and was accepted by \'Sue\' (fake name, do not want to get recognized).\n\nSue\'s husband, \'Peter\', picked me up from the train station at the nearest town, which was a half hour drive away from the farm, and I liked him instantly. He was nice, attentive, interested in what I had to say, zero weird vibes, talkative, excited about showing me how to take care of animals and plants.\n\nWhen we arrived at the farm, Sue was waiting inside. And lo and behold, he was a MtF. It actually shocked me because I really was not expecting it, but I swallowed my shock and was of course totally polite. I didn\'t even dare question why I felt betrayed inside my own head. I was deep into libfeminism at the time and didn\'t dare be transphobic. But the thing is, I felt unsafe. There were no women, at least from my POV at the time, no women \\*like me\\* in that house. We were far removed from town and I was the only volunteer, travelling alone in a country where I knew no one. I felt so, so unsafe but wasn\'t able to verbalize it at all, because it was a forbidden feeling.\n\nI was shown my room, which had no lock or key (something I instantly took note of), and in the days that followed I realized that Sue was simply not a very nice person. He was constantly dismissive of Peter, his long-term partner of several decades. Peter did all the housework and was sweet and patient with the chickens and cats, while Sue focused on his \'research\' (was actually retired) during the day and then would put him down and criticise him, saying things like, ""I don\'t let Peter do the hard stuff like using the electric saw in the garden, I don\'t trust him"". When saying stuff like this he would smile at me trying to get, what? Some sort of female complicity?\n\nHe made me feel very uncomfortable multiple times, bringing up the subject of politics at dinner repeatedly (was basically a conservative libertarian in his economics) and then shutting down my views when I responded, even though I made a point of avoiding politics because he was so forceful and disagreeable. He once asked me ""Oh don\'t you ever wear any jewellery or make up? I love jewellery, blabla"" in this fake-friendly tone, with this weird smile, and I was just like, um no I don\'t, thinking, how reductive of my womanhood is this? (Hello we\'re at a farm in the middle of nowhere, why on Earth would I dress up).\n\nOne day I was looking for Peter, with whom I developed a friendly relationship because I spent most of my days helping him out with chores and gardening, and went into their room, and saw Sue\'s silicone \'boobs\' on the table, just lying there. It made me feel so bad and out of place, and I still to this day cannot name what it is that I felt exactly, but the more I read in this sub the more I feel validated in my ickyness. Was it realizing that he was only wearing them in front of me in the evenings, but not during the day at home? I would have thought they just wore whatever all the time, seeing as it supposedly \\*is\\* who they are?\n\nI found out that he had lived as a man for 40 years before transitioning and that Peter still called themselves a \'gay couple\', which I found odd (as Sue was insistent on the problem of misgendering and talked a lot about trans discrimination cases that he read online). He had been a high executive in an industry that makes a lot of money, and lived with male rich privilege for most of his life, before transitioning. When I learned that I understood completely where his domineering attitude came from.\n\nA week after being there, I grew fed up of his antics, counted my money and left to travel around on my own. Peter drove me back to the station. I felt such relief when I left.\n\nAt the time I just read it as, ""Sue has suffered so much in her/his life, he/she just became sort of crazy"". But reading stories here it seems to be a pattern of highly entitled men being assholes to people for no reason, and shielding themselves in their feminine clothes to avoid being called out.\n\nAaah. I have never dared tell this story to its full extent before. I just hope nobody from my real life finds it and \'outs\' me as a terf, lol.

I was 15 and dating an 18 year old guy who'd been held back a year for 'emotional problems' as a child. After dating him for a few months I find out he has a huge fetish for dressing up as and pretending to be a little girl. Kinda weird, but as a teen I was trying really hard to be accepting of everyone and not judge. \n\nEventually he started putting bows in his hair and wearing whatever girls clothes he could find to school, behind his parents' backs. He was way, waaay beyond the normal boyish hormonal sex obsessed. Like, everything I said he made into an innuendo, and I was really uncomfortable. He was also pushing me to do sexual things, asking again and again until I said yes.\n\nWell, one day I caught him listening in on me when I was in the bathroom in his house. I was horrified, but he cried and begged me not to break up with him because he couldn't help it. Over the next month he started telling me about his other fetishes that he 'couldn't help.' It was disgusting stuff. There were two last straws within one week. After I told him I would not lend him a pair of my underwear, I found out he stole a (dirty) pair from my room and was wearing it to masturbate. Then he told me he was being forced to go to therapy for something that happened between him and his younger sister, but he 'couldnt tell me the whole story because [his mom] told him never to discuss it.' \n\nTo this day, I swear he touched her or something worse and the family kept it a secret. Looking back, she was never in the same room as us unless their mother was there as well. \n\nWell, years later I see his name on a roster for a program at my college. Only it's a 'girl' version of his name, which is pretty unique. I Google him to make sure and find his Facebook  page where his profile pic is him dressed up as a 'slutty cat's and fishnets and heels. I go home in tears because he was incredibly abusive, and the next day I go to see a crisis counselor because I don't feel safe knowing I might bump into him. \n\nThe counselor interrupts my explanation of how he abused me to say that I should respect his new pronouns. And that I should realize he probably doesn't feel safe on campus either, given his new status as a woman. She ends with asking me if 'she' raped me. If there was no penetrating rape, then why the extreme reaction nearly 4 years later to this woman who's obviously gathered the courage to turn her life around? \n\nPeak trans, then and there. And now I can't believe people who say that trans individuals are not in the bathroom to be creepy. I'm sure many aren't. But I know for sure, from my life experience, that one is. "", ""I've peaked before, but I'm peaking again over just three words:\n\nfemale-presenting nipples"", ""Re-peaking on a certain ball waxing pervert. Someone found selfies he took of himself in a woman's restroom. There are women and girls in the background. In one picture, there a young girl (10-12 years old). This sicko shouldn't be anywhere NEAR a women's restroom."", ""So I'm going to put myself out there. I'm a 25 year old male who, since elementary school has always wished he was born female. I decided not to transition because I simply don't believe SRS or hormones would make me female. I honestly wish I did believe that, but I don't.\n\nI've never told a single soul (IRL), and never really joined in the online community. I kept it internal.\n\nSometime in the last 4 months I popped in to r/asktransgender out of curiosity. For a while, I enjoyed it. While I didn't believe in transitioning I could fully support those who did. Then someone replied to a comment of mine, and it opened my eyes...\n\nI said that, as a straight male, I wouldn't date a trans person (even if they passed), because I'm not attracted to them. I added a ton of qualifiers, saying I didn't think less of them, and that I saw them as 100% female (a lie, in retrospect), thinking that I was being overly cautious.\n\nI did not expect the ferocity of the attacks that this would generate. I was called transphobic, a bigot, and insulted in ways I won't repeat. I was initially taken aback, but my surprise eventually led to a reexamination of everything I refused to question.\n\nI admitted to myself that I don't think trans women (to use their language) are true females. Why else wouldn't I transition?\n\nI admitted to myself that a lot of people were delusional, and would only be happy if others participated in it (such as giving free pap smears to trans women).\n\nI admitted to myself that some of the language people used was...unsettling. It seemed overly childish or like they were trying too hard.\n\nI admitted to myself that the argument that gender is a social construct was idiotic and hypocritical. That can't exist in a reality where I or anyone else has an innate gender identity,\n\nI admitted to myself that many refused to even talk about trans issues, instead insulting, dismissing, and attacking the people who put them forth. Whether or not anyone agrees with it, can you really not see that there are a thousand VALID reasons and arguments behind the critics?\n\nI admitted to myself it was hard to believe being transgender was legitimate, while being transage or transrace was ridiculous.\n\nOne thing I hadn't considered before reading this sub was the similarity between transitioning and cultural appropriation. It's essentially taking someones identity, and either claiming it as our own, or claiming it doesn't exist.\n\nOF COURSE I still believe gender dysphoria (or gender identity disorder) is real. I have it, and had it before I even really understood what gender was. But we've jumped so far outside the realm of reality, I can't even see the edge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"", ""I hit Peak so long ago but it has felt distant. Something I experience regularly interacting with people online - both that I have met and that I have not - but not something that enters into my daily life. Until today. In the past year I've fully reevaluated my life and gotten rid of the liberal feminists who cared more about policing thoughts than caring for actual people, my wife and I started hanging out almost exclusively with our lesbian friends, and for the first time we're really focusing on being active and healthy. Part of that is that we both joined the local roller derby team. It was amazing. For the past few months we've experienced the joys of supportive female friendship and women-only spaces. I've never felt so embraced and loved and encouraged by a group of people before, and it's become very dear to both of us.\n\nToday, our team accept a TIM as a new member who does not have any interest in playing our sport. He just wants to come and... watch. He says he can't skate, but most people on the team had never been skating at all when they started. Part of me is relieved - at least I won't have to go up against a man twice my weight and a full foot taller than me in practices. But the other part of me never wants to step foot in practice again because I don't want a man watching me during practices. This was my space. The one public activity I get to partake in where I'm not constantly being stared at by men. I'm a public servant for my day job, but I work at a church and I wait tables to make ends meet. I have a male roommate. Every aspect of my life there are men and I just don't want it taken away by a man pretending he's a woman so he can come watch my sport. He just wants to watch. I don't want to be watched.\n\nThis whole rant just seems so selfish when I read it back, but surely others on the team have to feel this way. Why is our ONE space, the ONE activity in this town designated for ONLY women, being taken away? If he wants to watch roller girls in action he should come to a bout like everyone else. The worst part, it seems, is that I had to go and create a brand new Reddit account to even post this rant. I'm sick at the thought of him being in our safe space, but I don't want to risk my thoughts on it getting me kicked off the team for opposing this. I don't know what to do."", 'Even though I\'ve been posting here for a long time, I\'ve never posted my peak trans moment because I couldn\'t remember what exactly it was. Suddenly, tonight, I remembered. This is gonna be long...\n\nYears ago (under a different username), I started getting tired of the sub twoxchromosomes because 1. way too many men and 2. tone policing up the ass. A woman could be pouring her heart out about some traumatic event that happened to her and all of the sudden everyone was pointing out how ""problematic"" her language was, ""exclusive,"" etc. (I didn\'t connect the dots at the time that so much of that was about ""transphobia"" and including men in everything - I just thought it was the new feminism/SJW bs and actually went through a long period where I resented feminism because all I saw was liberal feminism. Sad.) I envisioned a private space where women could just be themselves and speak about our anger, our passions, whatever was going on in our lives, and not be attacked for our language unless it was egregiously racist or bigoted. So I made an alternative. The goal was that the only requirement is that you are a woman. I wanted all women to have a place to talk about whatever affects us - it wasn\'t a feminist sub or anything, just a place for women. (If only I had known about radical feminism back then) I hoped it would bring women from many backgrounds and places together to bond over the one thing we all share.\n\nIt\'s dead now, so I won\'t post it here. But this is what happened...\n\nI added a couple of other women who seemed enthusiastic about a women-only space to help me. In retrospect I should not have been the head mod because I didn\'t have much experience with css and also had a very demanding job, but I wanted to create that space that as far as I could tell did not exist so I went ahead anyway. It was private and we developed an extensive vetting process to ensure people were women involving searching posting histories.\n\nAlmost immediately a few TIMs applied to join the sub. In my mind they did not count as actual women when it comes to the experiences and socialization we share, but several of the new mods I\'d added were very enthusiastic about being open to trans people like it was a given that they had the same experiences as us or something. I didn\'t want to be called ""transphobic,"" and I figured that there would only a few of them trying to get in, so I reluctantly went ahead with it.\n\nThen, as far as they knew, I pretty much dropped off of the face of the earth. I maintained that it was because of my job, but the reality was that LITERALLY ALMOST EVERY NEW APPLICANT WAS A TIM. The posts were all about ""passing"" or ""how do I tell my parents I\'m trans"" or ""HRT is so hard"" with one or two actual women\'s issues like sexism at work or sexual assault. I couldn\'t deal with it, and I\'ll admit that I was a coward and just sort of ghosted the sub I\'d opened in the first place. I was so pissed off that all of these men had taken over what was supposed to be a WOMAN\'S place to vent about horrible shit going on that affects us and turned it into ""look how cute I am in a bra"" bullshit. I couldn\'t face it and most of the other moderators seemed totally fine with it so I left things to them. It was partially my fault for not selecting the correct people to mod the place, of course.\n\nMonths later, I checked in on the sub and found out that they had booted the co-founding mod who actually agreed with my principles because they searched her history and found out she was transphobic, or some other SJW no-no. They also had changed the rules back to the typical SJW tone policing I had opposed in the first place. I got super pissed and kicked all of the mods off and was about to take the sub public because in my mind it no longer served a purpose. Most people were like ""Oh no but my parents might find out that I\'m trans!"" which I expected but I realized that could out a few of the women with actual private issues they may not want public (like experiences with rape) so I changed my mind. I basically went ""fuck it"" and gave the sub over to the people who were running it before, and fucked off back to my life.\n\nSo that was my experience with trying to create a space for women. Men WILL try to colonize it, and other women will facilitate their efforts to do so. I love this subreddit so much because the best mods run it and ensure that will never happen here. But it was heartbreaking at the time, and really opened my eyes to how narcissistic men can be in forcing women to cater to their every whim. If we want something they don\'t have, they will try to take it for themselves however they can. They do not give a fuck about how that affects us.', ""First peak: hearing from TRA-supporting libfem friends that it is transphobic to speak of the female reproductive system and its health problems.

We need to be able to talk about how women are expected to just silently accept pain, and how our pleasure is an afterthought, and that affects how our doctors view us.\n\nI will occasionally see TRAspeak show up in women's medical support groups, but thankfully it is rare so far. \n\nSecond peak is sad and I will post it later."", 'I just re-peaked when I learned that some TiMs on hormones claim to have monthly periods.\n\nI just don’t get it.

I hate to be crude but that’s some dumbass shit. \n\nDo these men even understand that estrogen levels drop during periods? I know the answer to that, which is probably not. And if they do, I bet they don’t bother to reduce their hormone dosage during their own “period.”\n\nThis extreme fetishization of menstruation is an insult and a violation.\n\nI have to wonder if the doctors of trans women support this nonsense or if they’re afraid to speak up. \n\n ', 'Re-re-peaked after just witnessing a live thread where a transwoman accused a transman of “mansplaining”.\n\nReal talk.

I dated a trans woman who I\'d met on the internet. This dude was clearly a dude built like a brick and looked nothing like he did in his pictures. His voice was more manly than fucking Hulk Hogan. He had crumby makeup and the whole date he talked about \'being a girl\' like he had any clue. It was all superficial bollocks about femininity that most women would roll their eyes at. Imagine that fake friend your best friend has but instead of a girl saying it, it\'s a 24 year old dude.\n\nAnyways, I really wanted to leave so I cut the date short. It was early evening (dark here in Stockholm, Sweden). He said ""no!"" and pinned me to a wall outside the restaurant. Then he winked and said, \'don\'t you want some girl on girl fun?\' I ran and reported him to the local services which were on the other side of the station which my train was at. Nothing came of it... of course and they defended his case saying I initiated it. To this day, trans-bians can fuck right off. There is no such thing and is just a way for men to access same-sex female relationships because they need to fetishise us.

I know I shouldn't take a break from activism or staying abreast of information, but I'm so tired. Nobody gives a fuck about women, and they're making it clear. Between the rise of fascist pro-white male ideas and the erosion of female rights by transgender people trying to erase the very concept of why female people need protections for our body autonomy and spaces, I'm worried we're on the precipice of something similar to Iran circa 1979. I hope men and women are waking up the same way I did a few years ago, but I'm very worried, I'm very tired, and I'm very unhappy.

My god that was offensive. "", 'I was told to post here, so here goes: I am finally at my wits end.\n\nI\'ve been as tolerant and understanding as I could be about trans issues in my life, but I\'ve been having thoughts lately about certain aspects of the libfem mindset. I am a biological female who has painful periods, struggles with birth control, and who has been unexpectedly pregnant and recently had an early miscarriage in February with weeks of side effects afterwards, still ongoing. I had to use the bathroom a lot when I was dealing with the after effects, and men wold come into the bathroom because it was ""neutral"". We had a big stink at work amongst some people after myself and a few other women requested that we re-gender the women\'s restroom back to ""women\'s"" instead of neutral after men had walked in on us and used urinals while we washed our hands, etc. Nobody cares about women\'s past trauma with men. We care about making hypothetical trans people (since our company doesn\'t even employ any trans people) comfortable/preventing their outrage more than we care about giving women a safe space. But I digress. These are women\'s issues, period (no pun intended). I\'m seeing more and more that it isn\'t okay to speak of these issues as women\'s issues for fear of offending trans women and libfems, so I\'ve just been silent on it for the most part. That was, until today.\n\nI was taking the train into the city for work, talking with a friend about a mutual friend of ours who\'s started hormone replacement therapy to be MTF this past year. This person, before their transition, was a shitty roommate to our friend, stole money, and refused to work collecting unemployment for 3 years, all the time living in Manhattan on borrowed money from their parents. They graduated from an expensive private art school and have since been collecting food stamps because they are reporting zero income. I made a comment to my friend about how it feels ridiculous that people are coddling this friend because - and simply because - she (previously he) is now ""a woman"" and ""going through transition. This person is spending basically stolen money to get HRT and not working to support themselves at all. Whenever I see this person I get to hear a lot about how hard it is to be a woman from her (previously, him). It felt wrong and feels wrong on many levels to have to hear about how tough it is to be a woman when dealing with very intense inescapable issues of being a biological woman such as unexpected pregnancy, constant threat of assault if you walk alone at night, just a whole slew of things that men don\'t really have to worry about.\n\nOur friend group reached a breaking point when this person verbally mocked our other friend over something he said, basically making comments about his mental capacity, etc. So, we all sort of agree at this point. Trans person isn\'t a good person, before or after their transition. I said to my friend, it bothers me that this person is using their trans status to get away with being a leech, a general lazy person, and trying to have their behavior excused because they are ""becoming a woman"". My friend replies ""a person can be an asshole whether they\'re trans or not - being trans isn\'t an excuse to have extra sympathy for issues you created before you were transitioning!""\n\nAt this point I nod, and all of a sudden, a (male appearing) person stands up and starts yelling over me on the train. They stand over me, as I am sitting screaming at my face blocking me from moving, ""Hey, I heard what you said about trans people! You are so fucked up! I\'m trans, you had a trans person sitting next to you this whole time, bitch! And you RUINED MY ENTIRE DAY because I had to hear this triggering shit! Fuck you!"" and the entire train car stares at me like, what must she have said against trans people to elicit that response. I then have to sit there, already exhausted, depressed, and tired, dealing with this insane stranger (I assume FTM) screaming at me without knowing any real details of my circumstances.\n\nI picked up my bag, got off the train at my station, and promptly took a Xanax I had from my procedure after my miscarriage to calm myself down because of how assaulted **I felt** as a person just trying to have a fucking conversation about a valid opinion about a very real situation.\n\nSo yeah - today I reached peak trans. I\'m exhausted by trying to be cautious, I\'m exhausted that we\'re more concerned about pronouns than we are about acid being thrown on rape victims in developing nations. We\'re not concerned about genital mutilation, we\'re concerned about hormone therapy. We have no safe spaces for women anymore because it\'s ""not fair"". You know what\'s not fair?

I\'ve always been involved in the LGBT community and still am. I do NOT hate people who are transgender. I feel that certain people who are can be very damaging and threatening to women and it all happened after being in a serious relationship with a trans person. \n\nYears ago I got into a relationship with someone who ended up coming out as TIM. \n\nI only had known TIFs so it was foreign to me. I decided to stay in the relationship, because I really did care about him. \n\nBasically he started off wearing stockings and heels. Nails always had to be done. First time he wore a dress in front of me he kept saying how it turned him on. Which I found strange. He had a huge anime obsession (which, as an anime/manga fan it didn\'t seem to be a big deal at first until I realized the subject matter of what he was into. He said he watched anime that fetishes men being transformed into women. He had a very skewed view of how women should dress and act. Very large breasts, long hair, nails always have to be done. Basically everything he knew about women was learned from porn. It just got worse and worse as he came out and went on hormones. \nThe most sickening was he once told me he fantasized about getting his teeth removed and used as a literal human toilet and sex slave in order to *be a woman*. THAT is how he would feel like a woman. It was extremely disturbing. \n\nHe would go to sex massage places and was obsessed with the strip club. It was gross.\n\nWhen I finally broke it off, he ended up threatening suicide and ended in the psych ward.  Work got involved(we worked together) and I was openly shamed by higher up employees for NOT being supportive. It was very unprofessional.  No one cared about how *I* felt, only cared to cater to his comfort and appear ""inclusive"" and ""accepting"". It was all work politics and I felt very uncomfortable all because I broke up with someone due to their toxic behavior. \n\nSomeone who is very close to me (related), who is MtF, actually warned me about his behaviour and said that it was rooted in deep misogyny. Apparently it is very prominent in the transgender community with TIMs. \n\n', 'Another tiny peak trans moment: I\'m planning to become a single mother by choice.\nThere is a closed group that I joined, with solo and co-parenting mothers and mothers-to-be from German speaking countries.\nIt\'s the first time in forever that I\'ve been in a 100% female space and it\'s so refreshing. We can talk about breaking out of sexist heteronormative family stereotypes, everyday stuff, politics, our fears and anxieties.\nI had to connect it to mumsnet in my head - one of the only websites that discussed a lot of gc content. They both have something in common - most of the people in the forum are mothers.\nWhatever TIMs say, they cannot become mothers, they cannot bear a child. They infiltrated my PMDD group and wanted us to acknowledge their ""periods"" as real. But they can\'t fake a pregnancy.\nIt\'s amazing to have such a space like my group and being able to be in a 100% female environment. We\'re going on a holiday in August - just us women and the kids. It\'s closed, so no queer activists are going to look into in but even if they did, what can they say? TIMs cannot become single mom by choice, except maybe through adoption but they wouldn\'t fit our brief anyway.\nIt makes me sad though. I may want to have children but many women don\'t. And they deserve their exclusive female space as well. We all deserve exclusive female spaces to share our thoughts, experiences and desires with other women. We deserve a space where women can support each other.\nBut the only spaces that are still truly ours are the ones based in our reproductive biology. No one can take this away from us, but it reduces us to our ability to bearing children yet again, instead of seeing womanhood as a complex reality that is exclusive to females.', 'saw people complaining about the pussy hats of the womens march. no one gave a damn that they were becuase of trump and his grab them by the p* ( sorry for censoring this but just typing it out makes me sick in the stomach ) and they were complaining about it not being inclusive and that not every woman had a vagina and not everyone with a vagina was a woman.\n\nimagine giving this little of a damn about survivors of sexual assault', 'I’ve peaked way back once I learned about the cotton ceiling and experienced it (I’m a lesbian). But recently something else happened that made me peak again. So I’m a software developer and work in a VERY male dominated company. Throughout my university and professional career, I ALWAYS had a harder time because I was a girl. I constantly felt obligated to prove myself as someone more than a “dumb white girl”. I’ve had guys harass me and I had one crazy dude that actually stalked me. I had a very hard time making friends in my undergrad because in a class of, say, 100 students, it was me and another girl as the only females. Whenever I’d start getting friendly with a guy, he’d try to progress the relationship further and then drop the friendship once I reject the advances (or I drop because they disrespected my sexuality). It was exhausting. I finally grew close to one guy that I thought was a cool dude. 2 years into our friendship, we went out to celebrate finishing finals and he raped me. I had no trust for any guy I met in my field after this. Being a female already comes with its own set of challenges... but being immersed in a male dominated field adds more to it. Anyways, I’ve graduated and moved into my professional life. I have a well paying job and have a lot of responsibilities managing other developers. I came into this company and was promoted above other male devs that had been there for years. They bitched and moaned about this to me and everyone else and tell me to my face that I only got promoted because I’m a girl. It’s like I was a fucking joke because I was a girl and they made me believe it for a bit too. They talk down to me and refuse to ask me for help when they clearly need it - then they collaboratively blame me for not meeting deadlines. There are a couple really cool guys I work with, mind you. But some are fucking assholes and coming into work is exhausting when you have to deal with this constant bullshit. I worked my ass off to get where I am today and I’m significantly more qualified than the guys I manage. My promotion was well deserved. So here is my re-peak moment. One of the male devs came out as trans. He is completely pre everything. Looks like a dude 100% and dresses kind of neutral. The dude has a full beard. A week after, he started going off about the struggles women face in STEM. The “struggles”. I am only 24 and this post explains my experiences as a female developer. He. Has. No. Fucking Idea what it is like being a girl in STEM. It’s an absolute joke that our company is forcing us to RECOGNIZE that he understands what it’s like to be a woman in STEM. The experience I had is something he will never have because he is male. It’s simple as that. We had a company meeting where he came up (to represent the females in the office???) and he was talking about using “inclusive” language to include women. The point of this meeting was to target the obvious gender gap at the company and to suggest ways to make women more comfortable. His only suggestion: using the term “guys” in the context of “hey guys” or some bs like this is NOT INCLUSIVE BEHAVIOUR. Like what the actual fuck is that? I’ve never thought about the word “guys” because .. like .. what the fuck. He did nothing but make a mockery by implying women get triggered by this. The REAL struggles women face are being erased and suggesting that a REAL woman’s experiences are the same as his is absolute fuckery and this is a perfect example of that.', 'Like so many of us here, I was a libfem and trans ally for many, many years before hitting peak.

The first one I really remember was the stupid backlash against Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nNow, for the second moment:\n\nI\'m in an online support group for adult daughters of narcissistic parents, and one of the members was a TIM (who was openly trans). Almost all of his posts to the group were heavily filtered selfies with some kind of hand-wringing comment fishing for compliments and validation on his appearance. One day, his selfie was accompanied with a post about how he was sooooo scared because the women\'s shelter he was staying at was considering allowing non-trans males in. He was going on about how it was so incredibly wrong and insensitive to force abused, vulnerable women (like him!) to share a safe space with men. The whole time I was reading about how he was terrified out of his mind, all I was thinking was, ""Oh, you mean like exactly what you\'re doing to every woman in that shelter?!"" (assuming the story is even true, of course). I really wish I would have screenshot it. It was ridiculous.\n\nThe comments were all from women cooing over him and justifying his terror. All I could think was how if I had said anything about it, I had no doubt that I would have been banned (there was a ""no transphobia"" rule, and we all know that doesn\'t refer to legitimate hatefulness, it just means ""no differing opinions on trans issues allowed""). Nowadays I would post it anyway and not care about being banned, but I wasn\'t ready for that at the time. I know I couldn\'t have been the only one pissed about it, and it made me so angry because so many of us were always posting about how we were trying to fight back our life-long programming of being doormats. And then there we were, having to coddle an insecure male, who knew he could rely on female socialization for self-esteem boosts. And if we spoke out in defense of our own safety or the hypocrisy of the situation, we\'d be punished for it. In a support group that\'s supposed to be for us. Yup!

I despised being small and weak, being touched unasked by boys, being talked over. It felt wrong. Like I shouldn’t be this way. My body parts must have been to blame.

I hated things considered feminine, I was disgusted by breasts and vaginas, I was gruff and didn’t cry and liked my solitude, clearly this all meant I was male deep down.\n\n\nMany times I came close to pulling the trigger on transition and not a single solitary person in my life knows. Because every time I looked into it, I felt...shame. Guilt. Like I was betraying something. And I had come to that stage, which was staggeringly my late twenties, where you begin to take inventory of all the women around you who are “not like other girls” and you start to wonder if those “other girls” even exist. And one day, I realized, without an ounce of self-deprecation: \n\n\n“I am not special”. \n\n\nI am not special, and how dare it be implied that I am. I am not one of those rare, unique women who is actually a full human. Not correcting people about my sex was not a symptom of a male brain, it was just desperation to suck up the scraps of dignity that their mistake would afford me. Hating my body wasn’t a symptom of being denied a male form, it was a response taught to me by every external force that had hated it first. \n\n\nAnd I could speculate why—having nothing but nasty female role models, having affinities for all the ‘wrong’ hobbies, being yelled at by my single father at twelve years old for not warning him I was about to get my first ever period—but it would be ultimately pointless. What matters is that I finally realized that I didn’t need to be male. I just needed to be valued like one. Barring that, I needed to just be left the hell alone.\n\n\nBecause I was as self-centric as most younger people tend to be, I didn’t really use this lens to look at others for quite some time. My thoughts on transsexuals were, “I’ll call you what you want, and while I don’t think you should have that kind of elective surgery, that is an individual adult’s choice. I also don’t agree that people should tattoo their faces but it’s flatly none of my business.” This was before the sudden divide between supposed gender and sex.\n\n\nOnce that divide made itself known, I didn’t think much of that, either. Sure. You can live the other sex’s fabricated roles, why not? Good for you. I didn’t bat an eye about the initial bathroom conundrum. I remember being asked if I’d be uncomfortable using the bathroom with a biological male in it and saying, “Look, to be frank, I’m uncomfortable when I have to share a bathroom with ANYONE.” And that’s still true, but of course, I didn’t think about the recourse. I was still thinking of trans folks as people who had undergone surgery. It didn’t occur to me that other types of people could claim any identity they pleased to gain private, cornering access to women. \n\n\nAnd then I think...the tipping point might have been some post somewhere that criticized this and I thought, “That’s kind of mean. But...it made a good point about A and B. And maybe C.” And one good point begets another, and another, until it’s an avalanche of devastating realizations and personal accounts about gender struggles that hit so close to home that the impact is concussive. And just like that I felt like I could finally see myself with clarity. I stopped hating myself—there were millions of people already actively doing that for me and I’m a firm believer in delegation.  \n\n\nFinding this sub has been everything.', 'I come to this from an unusual perspective. I was married to a MtF post op trans person for 12+ years. We dated before and after their transition.\n\nMy relationship with them made me believe there are people who are deeply dysphoric  and unhappy with their gender role, but that treatment for the dysphoria and gender critical therapy would be a much better standard of care than surgery. \n\n Let me start by saying that some of this post will at first sound like pro-trans, not peak trans. That\'s because I was married to a rare trans person who was aware and accepting that they were post op M2F trans, not a biological woman. Rare is the key word here.\n\nShe was an unusual person among the trans community.  For one thing, she struggled going through the necessary therapy required for surgery, because she didn\'t fit in to the trans community. Why?  Because she hated the ""shallow, hyper-feminine BS"" that the other MtF people at the support groups reveled in. \n\n We used to talk about how much we hated the Benjamin standard of care, because it pretty much wanted someone to live a 1950s caricature of womanhood in order to convince your therapist that you could be a good enough woman and therefore allowed to have surgery.\n\n When my ex 1st started on hormones and therapy prior to transitioning, one day I had enough of the fake person they were becoming, and told them, ""Hey, you have been a metal guitarist and punk rock person as long as I have known you, you like metal band T shirts and ripped jeans, why are you dressing like a soccer mom now? This just isn\'t you. Why does living as female mean you can no longer be yourself?"" \n\nAnd they were able to instantly reply ""Hmm... yeah that\'s true! I can just dress like ME - who gets to limit and define what \'feminine\' can look like?"" \n\nBecause of course that is what society tells us - tells all women born into these bodies - that being female means you can\'t be yourself. That being female means being someone\'s 1950\'s caricature of femininity. \n\nMy ex was unusually open minded about gender, and so I  was able to have conversations with them that you just can\'t have with a lot of the M2F trans people today. \n\nFor example, I was able to ask ""Do you think that having an absent father who was abusive whenever he was home, plus a mother who constantly ranted about what trash men are, maybe made you not want to be a part of that sex/gender?""\n\nAnd they responded ""Well yeah probably... I will bring that up in therapy... but whatever caused the dysphoria, I still have it.""\n\n One of the things I remember respecting about my ex, was that they were willing to drive an extra 2 hours, a couple times a week, to attend therapy with the only female therapist in the region who specialized in transgender issues. \n\nBecause, as they said ""I would feel so stupid, having this male body, growing up male, sitting in an office with a male, talking about what womanhood is. How can a man tell me what it will mean living as a woman? Only a woman can tell me that.""\n\nMy peak trans moment was when my ex, after living as a woman for over a decade, had a male style mid life crisis. Now, both men and women have them. But it\'s a very different and recognizable pattern for men vs women going through that issue. \n\nMy ex went through the exact perfect male pattern of midlife crisis, totally wrecked our marriage, our band and our friendship in the usual selfish male pattern - blaming everyone around them for their own past decisions.\n\n And that, of course, was the final straw in any belief I might have still harbored about people being able to choose sex or gender. \n\n Sorry, but being socialized male and growing up with a Y-chromosome and your brain being soaked in testosterone, means that if you do have a midlife crisis, it\'s going to take the male pattern. \n\nAnd that means that on a genetic and psychological level, you may be an atypical male, but you\'re not a woman.\n\n Because I was married to a trans person, I got to see the trans community from the inside... This is just one person\'s lived experiences and observations, so take it for whatever you think it\'s worth.\n\n But what I noticed was that the community in the 90\'s was actually made up of 3 or 4 main demographics.\n\n *What I would call the genuinely dysphoric trans people. Mostly born men, socialized male gender, transitioning to female. \n\n*A very few F2M born women, transitioning to male gender. \n\n(I suspect  that if I had been born a decade later, I probably would have been one of these. \n\nLuckily growing up in the late 80s and early 90s during the punk and grunge movement, I was able to be aggressive, athletic, assertive competitive, dressed in jeans and metal t-shirts and leather jacket and combat boots, and pursue my ""boyish"" interests, without being thought of as too weird.\n\n Instead of saying ""Oh that girl is Butch or that girl is obviously a trans man, get her hormones and therapy..."" , people were able to glance at me and go ""Oh, another androgynous riot grrrl punk rocker, cool.""  It\'s almost as if punk/metal/goth subculture was it\'s own gender! So it kind of gave you a free pass. )\n\n*The ""full time drag queens"" - some of whom were literal drag queens. From how they talked about in group therapy, I wouldn\'t necessarily describe most of this demographic as autogynephiliacs, although I\'m sure that there were some within their numbers.\n\n The thing about these people is, they performed an exaggerated caricature of stereotypical femininity. And THAT, not actual womanhood, was what they wanted to transition to and live as. \n\nAnd they didn\'t realize that most women born biologically women and socialized female, don\'t do that, and wouldn\'t want to. \n\nWhich brings me to another moment of peak trans.  I love drag queens and drag shows, when it is understood that their performance is about an over the top parody caricature of a stereotypical gender role. But when people start to mistake a satirical parody of cultural femininity for actual Womanhood, and then criticize biological women for not living up to their stereotype, I\'m just done.\n\n* The autogynephiliac fetishists... personally, I think most of these guys should have just found themselves a good Domme who enjoyed putting them in pretty makeup and lingerie and making them behave as her sissy boy. Some of them did. \n\n I didn\'t recognize it as a moment of peak trans back then, but I remember thinking that three-quarters of these guys really didn\'t need to be in the support group. They needed to be at a drag show, or playing sissy boy dress up with their domme. \n\n I remember thinking that most of these people were so completely narcissistic, self centered, and over dramatic about every little thing, and that they had no idea how most women have to go through our daily life with a quiet calm strength to deal with all the bullshit we deal with every day. \n\nIf they\'d had to live the actual life of a biological woman, they would have been lying on their bed sobbing dramatically within the 1st couple hours.\n\nMy mistake was in thinking that they actually wanted to live the actual daily life of a biological woman. \n\nSomewhere in there, they have gotten the stereotypical caricature confused for the reality, and that glamorous character is what they want to live and transition to, not the real thing.\n\n\nI do think there are genuinely people who are 100% miserable in the gender role that their biological sex pressures them into. \n\nBut the simple solution to that is to break down barriers of gender. \n\nAlthough I disagree with hormone therapy and surgery and the hoops trans people jump through to ""change sex,"" I will say this for it; that it used to function as a barrier to entry.\n\nIf someone was willing to cut off their dick to be called female, willing and able to go through tons of surgery and medical treatment and therapy...?\n\nWell, it\'s a terribly drastic way to treat dysphoria... but it seems like used to weed out a lot of the truly disturbed and dangerous fetishists as well as most autogynephiliacs.\n\nAt least if they were an abusive type person, they wouldn\'t have a dick to commit assault with anymore. At least they\'d have to go through a few years of therapy. It functioned as a sort of rough and unintentional ""vetting"" process. \n\nAgain, I think that surgery and hormones is doing a terrible malpractice level disservice to dysphoric people, but at least there IS some medical and mental health oversight happening. \n\nThis thing where anyone who wants access to any service or space that\'s been set aside for biological women FOR GOOD REASON, can just HAVE access now? No. Those spaces HAD to be set aside for actual real reasons of physical, emotional, and mental safety. There have to be barriers to entry, or they\'re by definition not safe.\n\nWe are getting to the point where a stalker, rapists, abuser, can just say ""oh I\'m a woman, it\'s cool"" and walk into places where their victims are trying to escape. \n\nNo. \n\nNot only does it take more than just saying ""I\'m  a woman"" to be a woman...\n\nI\'ve met trans people who were genuinely severely dysphoric, I was married to one for 12 years, and it takes more than just saying ""I\'m a trans woman"" to be a dysphoric transgender person.\n\nMy most peak trans moment is in coming to the belief that most of the current people who claim to be trans, AREN\'T. Probably most are not even dysphoric in a clinical sense. \n\nYou don\'t like your gender role? \n\nYep. Gender sucks. \n\nYou don\'t need surgery and hormones and access to woman only spaces and services to simply live a different way.', 'Hi all!. long story short, I am a desisted TIF, used to be the libfem type, Tumblr contagion, peer pressure, you all know the story already. It may sound extreme but I would not hesitate in calling it a ""cult"". Anyway, the spell broke when I started noticing patterns and realised that TIMs in Trans spaces acted just like men (quelle surprise) and that Trans-iding wasn\'t the happy pill I wanted it to be, in fact it only made things worse. I didn\'t really ""peak"" until I read the ROGD paper. It really put things into  a different perspective, I was kind of shocked by how accurate to my experience it was.

I had friends who would bring it up as if she was a horrible monster and a ""disappointment"" to ""feminism"". I watched the interview and I completely agreed with her views. When a good friend brought it up to me, starting with ""isn\'t that fucked up?"" I told her that Chimamanda was stating the fact that male and female people have different lived experiences and socialization, regardless of how they identify. \n\nI had heard so much about ""TERFs"" being equated with ""white feminism"" by people who had never picked up Alice Walker, bell hooks or Audre Lorde. People who had never read a feminist text outside of BuzzFeed. I kept seeing the term ""women and femmes"" and realized that term, by its logic, equates womanhood with performative femininity.\n\nAs a teenage girl I was gender non conforming and even had periods where I thought I might, too, be trans. I was not feminine, I was introverted, and my arab features (hooked nose, dark curly hair - which i now love) were considered ugly in my predominantly white hometown. I realized my true problem was with standards of femininity forced upon women, especially young girls. I feel so inspired by women and to be a woman. I feel betrayed by those who were not born as women trying to equate our experiences. \n\nOn that - I started to pay attention to the online echo chambers and circular logic of ""trans women are women!!"" when none of them can answer my question, ""What is womanhood?""\n\nI\'m very grateful to have this community. <3 ', 'When my colleague was ""shadowbanned.""

The latest bullshit was some guy complaining that he was being forced to do “emotional labour” because lesbians didn’t want to have sex with his ladydick.  Seriously - he was complaining that it was unfair to make him have to try and convince women who aren’t sexually attracted to men to have sex with him.  Apparently no doesn’t mean no any more, it means the person saying no is an evil Terven transphobe who is actively oppressing all lady dicks who should be re-educated to love the dick.

And, just not right.', 'Random comment but I love revisiting this thread every few days to see it constantly being added to. It gives me hope lmao', 'Hello, all. I\'ve been a radfem for about a year (I think?) now. I can\'t exactly pinpoint an exact peak trans moment for me, but one of the things that threw me was the fact that transwomen are being considered female in crime statistics. As someone who is getting a degree in criminal justice, this is just alarming to me. Not only is it skewing statistics for women, but it also puts women in women\'s prison\'s in danger, *especially* if the transwomen are imprisoned for violent or sex crimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA kind of peak trans moment was this past year, when I was still with my ex-boyfriend. He had a group of friends that he would play roleplaying games with, two of them being identical male twins. One of them, however, was a transwoman. Cool, okay, fine. I didn\'t end up liking him. At all. Not because he was trans but because he was *so god damn annoying*. What bothered me about his trans situation is that he made absolutely zero effort to transition, yet expected everyone to call him she/her pronouns. The only thing that he would do on occasion is wear makeup and heels sometimes. Another thing that bothered me was that he was apparently a sex educator, where he taught people how to engage in certain kinks properly, including BDSM and bodily-fluid play (I\'m not sure what that is called). In addition to being gender-critical, I am also kink and porn-critical, so that was just the icing on the cake. He would do these things and just constantly talk about what it is to be a woman, when he very clearly has zero idea what being a woman is. I am all for having men who want to wear makeup and dresses and heels, but it is only when they say that it makes them a woman that I have issue with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to be very pro-trans, but then I started reading radfem stuff and saw the absolute toxicity and male-centrism that is liberal feminism and the TRA community. However, when I was pro-trans, I always got a sour taste in my mouth whenever I would say ""trans women are women"", because I knew, even then, that they very much were not. I first started questioning it with Caitlyn Jenner, when he was called Woman of the Year for getting plastic surgery and changing his name.

I disagree with the way nonbinary identity erases sex and individuality because it is inevitably trapped in response to gender stereotypes, but I believe that people who go by nonbinary are trying to reject those stereotypes, even if they do just end up reinforcing them.

', 'I don\'t actually recall a specific peak moment, but it\'s happened some time within the past three or four months. Honestly, I\'m not sure that I\'ve hit a peak at all. I\'ve still got lots of questions, and a few doubts. But at some point after coming here, I realized that there were certain tenets of transgender theory that did not hold up to the sharp questions that others before me had asked. I normally try very hard to think critically about any new information I receive, and I am abashed that I did not apply this same scrutiny to transgender theory when I first heard of it. In an effort to be progressive and welcoming, I had neglected to fully reason out the possible implications. Below is an example line of thought (among many) which first led me down the rabbit hole of r/gendercritical:\n\n\n\nLet\'s say, just for purposes of thought experiment, that the transgender narrative is true; that transgender people are trapped cruelly in opposite bodies, and that their dysphoria can only be alleviated through medical and/or social transition. In the case of a non-passing MTF person, I imagine that this would be especially painful. However, given that transition can now be ""bought"" by anyone with sufficient resources, regardless of one\'s ""true"" identity or dysphoria, how does one differentiate the ""true"" trans woman from a man who is faking it for sexual gratification? *How do you tell the difference between the ""woman trapped in a man\'s body"" and the perverted fetishist?*  **You can\'t - there\'s no objective criteria now.** (Sexual dimorphism is so 1995). Both these people will self-identify as women. And both can go on their merry way, using women\'s bathrooms, women\'s gyms, and women\'s support groups as they please.\n\n\n\nAnd you can\'t just wave this aside, and assume that ""no one would ever really do that"". But men *do* do that. It\'s been documented countless times. And I would think, that if the ""true"" trans women were the ""real"" women that they claim to be, that they would also have a vested interest in protecting these women\'s spaces from perverted male fetishists... because if trans women are women, exactly like us, they sure as hell don\'t want to assaulted or leered at by men.\n\n\n**But for some reason**, trans-rights advocates are curiously silent about this. There\'s a certain ""no-true-trans-woman"" fallacy at work. Trans women can\'t say, ""well, those men are perverts but I\'m just a woman just like you"", because the only criteria for determining that is ... because they said so. Which is exactly what the perv is going to say when he\'s questioned. So in order to spare the feelings of less than 1% of the population, we now have to endanger up to 49% of it. God forbid that the statistics of self-preservation should ever triumph over social etiquette!\n\n\n\nAnd when I first asked this question, I still firmly believed that trans women were ultimately just like natal women, and that both groups could engage in reasonable discourse about how to best combat this problem. But any internal questioning, no matter how much your ""heart was in the right place"", was anathema. You were either 100 percent ally, or 100 percent vile terfy transphobe. Inquiry was bigotry. Polite questions were ""concern-trolling"".\n\n\n\nAs a side note: if you *ever* find yourself in a group which initially presents itself as a paragon of progressivism, truth, and light, but once you\'re in the fold, you find that its beliefs are immutable and require your utter mental submission - and that any questioning or deviance leads to verbal or mental abuse, ostracism, doxxing, stalking, harassment, or other threats - **you are in a cult**. As an atheist, I have never been crucified by the atheist community for thinking critically about atheism. As an artist, I am never mocked or excluded for my choice of pens.

You can also google the rape allegations against this person but it is hard to find due to tumblr flagging the survivors as ""terfs."" beyond insane.\n\nSo naturally, this really sparked my skepticism of the transgender ideology, because on paper, it seems like this person wanted access to female space, lesbian space, to commodify, dominate, and ultimately assault us. My thoughts worried me, because ""TERF"" fear is so pervasive in the progressive lesbian community. However, it has really come to my attention that in 2019, the worst thing you can be is an actual, biological woman.\n\nMy wife and i discuss this often because she is a more androgynous presenting woman and is constantly misgendered by our ""open minded"" and ""well meaning"" extended social circle. it drives me up a wall, and it truly offends her. My wife is proud to be a woman, and i\'m proud to be a lesbian woman. It has taken so many of us years to accept this facet of ourselves, but it seems that people in our own community are rejecting their femininity due to this highly popularized regressive gender ideology.\n\nSo wait, you\'re non binary because you played sports in high school or you like mens pants? Jesus. Isn\'t it more radical to redefine these archaic tropes instead of rebranding and shaming ourselves for being women? This whole non binary trend is so fucking huge in the lesbian world now that I really question what is going to become of us. It seems like everyday I meet another lesbian who goes by ""they/them"" because they have an asymmetrical haircut. Where are all of our strong butch women? the ones who really threw the first punch at Stonewall... Lesbian erasure is nothing new though so although i was frustrated, i still tried to maintain an open minded standpoint because who am i to judge when i too have been shamed for my sexual orientation by people who don\'t understand.\n\nHowever, my ""peak trans"" moment happened when i noticed that the instagram page ""personals"" (a hookup/meeting networking instagram for gay women following the trend of long form adds in old newspapers) began posting personals written by trans women as an aim to be ""inclusive."" \n\nWhy are women always making themselves malleable to the whims and desires of men?! Why are lesbians not aloud to exclude fucking men? isn\'t that the point? even our own content creators are shoving cock at us now.\n\nHonestly, these were not well meaning trans women who are struggling to leave the house due to their gender dysphoria and all the other bullshit ive been conditioned to believe about the mental heath of trans people - these were straight up men calling themselves ""dykes"" and \'lesbians."" They were not struggling to ""pass,"" they were co-opting feminine tropes established under the male gaze. I thought it was a one off, but EVERY SINGLE TIME i clicked on these trans profiles, i found the same type of man. It seems like ""real"" trans people are few and far between because these people are not even concerned with blending into any sort of feminine ""beauty standard"" besides hooker-lite lingerie and cat ears. (teddy fucking gieger anyone?)\n\n Their instagrams were full of self praise and demands of validations as ""women"" -  when they could have passed as career truck drivers with a mental illness. How the fuck do you know about mysoginy when you literally look like the type of dude women are afraid after dark of at rest stops.\n\nAs a woman who has been called a ""waste"" by heterosexual men, and then a dyke in the same breath, i lost it. the fact that other lesbians are even indulging this behavior at the risk of being called ""transphobic"" is truly maddening. The more I looked at these men who didn\'t even try to look like women, the more the ideology completely fell apart for me. If trans people experience dysphoria when they don\'t ""pass"" - why are so many of them not even trying? where do we draw the line?\n\nI do not think anyone should be hindered or harmed for exercising their basic human right to expression any way they see fit, - but men have no place in female space. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being trans, just like there is nothing wrong with being a person of color. But as a white person, i let people of color have their space and I do not demand access to their safe spaces because I stay in my lane, like a true ally. I understand when things are not for me, and the more I open my eyes, the more I see that the MTF trans community refuses to do that. They dox, humiliate, and silence REAL women and demand for lesbians to accept their sexual advances. & if they dont ?! Terf.\n\nI am sick to death of the lack of boundaries between trans people and gay people. We are ""related,"" but we are not the same. We can support one other without living in a fictitious world where biology isn\'t reality. Their back-asswards logic and pop psychology literally renders gay people out of existence. by arguing that ""lesbians can and have to like girl dick,"" you\'re literally doing exactly what the heterosexual world has done to us for, like, ever. ""How do you know you dont like it if have not tried it?""  \n\nThis is what men have done to women for ages. Now we are getting it in our own fucking community? \n\n This is stereotypically a trans female issue, because you DO NOT see this in gay male culture. Trans men would be laughed out of a weho sex party. Yet, because we are women, these men feel like they can continue to benefit from the mysoginy they were socialized under, get loud, and steam role women\'s spaces because people are afraid to not seem ""woke.""\n\nThis thread gives me hope and I now plan on speaking up about my new found truth in my social circle. This bullshit has to end. Thank you all for making me feel like a rational human, not a hateful ""transpobe.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit (for typos!) ', 'My Peak Trans moment was just my own journey.\n\nI began questioning whether I was really a man during my abusive relationship. I imagined cutting off my breasts and sticking a chain saw up my vagina so he could no longer use them and so no man would be attracted to me. When I shared these thoughts with others, I was told it meant I was trans and these thoughts were normal.\n\nI transitioned although it did not include hormones or surgery, though I thought about it a lot. I also went back and forth between am I genderqueer or trans.\n\nMy story is long but long story short it is obvious now that this was all caused by trauma. I hold my tongue in every day life but I’m getting to the point where I might start being outspoken about myself and my story. I don’t believe that even within the trans community there is a small percentage that might be really trans. It’s all caused by trauma or mental illness.', '[deleted]', ""For me, it was when I crunched the numbers (as best I could) to discover that the murder rate of trans people didn't seem to be any higher than the national average in the US, and that most of the trans people murdered were also sex workers and black or Hispanic. And then, it's the continued 'being trans is literally the worst, most hard thing ever all my life is suffering' narrative concurrent with 'being trans is so quirky and fun and why would the cis people be so scared of us lol?' from the \\*same person\\*. You can't claim that being trans makes suicide and other terrible things way more likely and then be shocked that parents are horrified when their children claim to be trans. Also, no, it's not particularly amusing that random people can't figure out whether to call you sir or ma'am because you look like a twelve year old boy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was also reading about Marsha P. Johnson, and how absolutely messed up his life was. And how he actually didn't 'identify as a woman'. It was reading Julia Serano's book and wondering why the hell she was so intently focused on being allowed to enter one particular festival in Michigan, far from her home, when there were surely many other places that would be happy to have her. It was noticing the narcissism and that every single trans person I have known seems to have some serious mental health problems and unresolved issues. It was getting screamed at on FB about how I clearly wanted my trans family member dead because I dared to point out that many folks don't know the term 'cis', even though I was agreeing with the (trans) screamer. "", 'My peak trans moment: I was in a science-based FB group about parenting. Someone asked for resources for a child who might be transgender. I suggested looking at 4thWaveNow for some thoughts on how to support your kids without necessarily jumping to hormones/surgery (for which there is little scientific evidence). \n\nThe reaction I got from these fellow liberal women - I was accused of concern-trolling, being a bigot, a proponent of conversion therapy, etc. I have never felt bullied like that before. \n\nI don\'t know where to go if genuine questioning and exploration is verboten. \n\nI started off decidedly pro-trans, and I still do sympathize with the plight of people with gender dysphoria and support people doing what they have to to feel comfortable in their bodies. I use preferred pronouns. But I have some limits when it comes to teaching kids that they\'re ""born in the wrong body"" based on their interests/style, or having biologically male people competing in women\'s sports. \n\nAnyway, thanks to this group for making me feel not so alone. ', 'I think I get peak transed every day online.  I\'ve lost count of the number of times I thought I was looking at a group stating that it\'s ""for women"" only to find out that a huge percentage of the ""women"" are TiMs and ""non-binary"" people.\n\nAt first I was completely sympathetic but I ultimately felt like I didn\'t have much in common with most of the people in groups like this.  I had the most in common with ""non-binary"" people who were obviously natal females but God help you if you called one of them ""she."". I\'m exaggerating a bit but I think everyone here knows what I\'m talking about.  \n\nThere would be minimal discussions of what I considered to be more basic women\'s issues and lots of stuff like how the women\'s March was TERFy for using ""pussy hats.""   Since they were literally hats with cat ears and not representations of actual female anatomy I could not understand why this was so upsetting.  It\'s like people were angry that women had this particular anatomy.  Lots of time was taken up with individuals\' gender identity issues.  \n\nEventually I got tired of having to keep my mouth shut about everything.  You couldn\'t bring up women\'s history or talk about things like reproductive health without someone getting upset.  I wish I had the courage to tell people off but I just quietly ghosted.  I don\'t particularly want someone with too much time on their hands and a narcissistic injury trying to hunt me down.\n\nI do remember distinctly the outrage that ensued when Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie said that she believed ""trans women were women"" but that a person brought up as a boy would have a different experience than one raised as a girl.  My first reaction was, how could it be any other way? Nonononono, TiMs were either ""oppressed"" by masculinity or insisting that their experience as feminine boys was somehow equal to the experience of natal women and girls.\n\nI\'m still enraged that some of these people claim to be speaking ""for WOMEN"" while I can clock them without even seeing what they look like.  ', 'Hi, everyone. I’ve made a few posts on GC but I finally decided that I should share my Peak Trans story. Like many, I lurked on here and on radfem Twitter/YouTube for a while before posting, and I’ve peaked multiple times. \n\nI should add that I’m a 20-something, bisexual woman who’s had relationships with men and women, though I am currently dating a man. I also used to be very libfem. Being bi, I felt comfortable lurking on Lesbian/WLW Tumblr/Twitter. A lot of the perspectives that were being shared made sense to me. Then I started seeing more TRAs saying that lesbians should not have a problem sleeping with TIMs who ID as lesbian. This didn’t seem right to me, though I started doubting these I initial ideas as I am bisexual. “How can I be thinking, ‘I don’t want to sleep with a transwoman!’ when I’m bi? I like men and women! So if a woman has a penis, it really shouldn’t be a problem!” Yet I couldn’t escape these thoughts, and it became apparent that my attraction is for (cis)men and (cis)women. I felt like something was wrong with me because I wasn’t attracted to trans people, even when I was attracted to butch women and feminine men. While I was struggling with these thoughts and trying to rationalize a lot of pro-trans logic, I stumbled across radfem circles on social media and things started to click for me.\n\nPeak Trans moment #1 - reading a piece by them. writer Jacob Tobia. He (she? they?) criticized the Women’s March for not being femme-inclusive. He suggested instead that it be renamed “Women and Femme March” or simply “Femme March.” I thought to myself, “Do you see what you’ve just done though? Your first suggestion included femmes, and your second suggestion then completely erased women.” It made me frustrated and angry. The co-opting of our spaces terrifies me because it has much larger implications. \n\nPeak Trans moment #2 - I still follow a lot of trans/GNC/NB Twitter accounts. One person (who identifies as gay/queer and trans/non-binary) never really bugged me, until I saw something they said during March for Our Lives. A picture of a poster was going around the internet (you’ve probably seen it; it had a drawing of the female reproductive system and said, “I don’t know enough about guns to demand regulation? Label this diagram of the female reproductive system. I’ll wait.”). This person quote tweeted the photo, saying that the language was insensitive to trans/NB people. They started a whole thread to explain why, and said that the reproductive system pictured is not necessarily female, and even though they themself possess that reproductive system, it makes them “really anxious” to be called female. (I rolled my eyes at that.) A woman who joined the thread claimed to work at some sort of health center and said that they all were starting to use language like “uterine system” (instead of “female reproductive system”) and “uterine-bodied people” (instead of “women”). That really bothered me, because it was yet another glaring inconsistency from TRAs. They hate on lesbians for being “so fixated” on body parts/genitalia, but they think it’s okay to refer to women as “uterine-bodied people.” \n\nPeak Trans moment #3 - Rose McGowan. As a rape survivor myself, I’ve had to deal with penis/male body repulsion. (Side note: as previously mentioned, I’m currently dating a man. I’ve had to work through a lot of issues, and sometimes it’s still hard, but I enjoy being with my partner, and he’s been supportive and understanding re: sexual hangups. That being said, penis/male body repulsion is not something that everyone needs to or can work through. For some, it’s not an issue at all! And that’s perfectly fine.) I cannot fathom trying to tell my story and being yelled at by someone who wonders why I’m not centering his/her struggle. I’d previously read tweets from TIMs who said things like, “It’s okay to have your own perspective of womanhood, as long as you don’t try to claim that that is the truth for everyone.” At first, I though, “Okay, cool, so we’re on the same page. Womanhood is different for everyone and that’s okay.” But since then, time and time again, I’ve seen women—straight, bi, lesbian—being demonized and called TERFs because they make a statement about what womanhood is to them or they’re telling their story. So I’ve had to backtrack and think, “Okay, wait, I thought we cleared it up that women have different experiences and that it’s okay for a woman to say that *something* (eg. her biology) is essential to her experience of womanhood because she’s talking about her individual experience and not everyone’s experience. But I guess we didn’t actually agree that that was okay, and it turns out it’s not?” Because women, like Rose McGowan, were still sharing their perspectives, opinions, experiences, and struggles, and they were being called TERFs. It made no sense to me. If I’m not trans, and I’m talking about my personal experiences, my story will not necessarily be trans-inclusive. Why is that inherently problematic? It made me realize that I would never be able to post any art or written pieces about my experiences as a woman or the things that are essential to my womanhood, because I’d be called a TERF and demonized by my peers, even if I were only discussing my own individual perspective. \n\nPeak Trans moment #4 - seeing a TIM on Twitter say something like, “If you cant avoid falling back to biology when you talk about what a woman is, I guess you don’t know what it means to be a woman as well as you thought you did!” I was infuriated. Biology is central to what it means to be a woman. Additionally, I’ve yet to see a TIM give a clear definition of what a woman is (a definition in which “woman” can’t be replaced with “man” or “human person” and still be true!). \n\nNow that I’ve peaked and regularly read posts here on GC, I see Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr through a new lens. I see posts from trans people and allies and the mental gymnastics they do is just...astounding. Yet they have so much support! I’m so worried about the future. Not just as a bisexual woman, but also as an educator, and someone who regularly travels and works with people of other cultures. Trans politics affect so many areas of life. I’ve seen it go from “just bathrooms” to sports, medical terminology, language in general, spaces for women and lesbians, and so on. I can’t imagine what the future will be like if this is allowed to continue. \n\nActually, no, I can, and it seriously frightens me. ', 'My story is probably really similar to what everyone else has said. In a nutshell, I was on FB and needed friends for those really terrible games they have that require you to add someone through FB in order to advance in the game. One of the people I added was a trans-identified man. I was fine with him identifying as a woman because, at first, he was just as compassionate and caring as anyone else on my friends\' list. But then he began posting all sorts of ""Just Girly Things"" memes, which are these images that are washed in pale pink and slapped with a cursive font that reads something stupid and sexist about ""boyfriends"" and ""feeling pretty."" This was a 40 year-old man, and nothing wrong with liking pastels as a 40 y/o male, but he was taking femininity as signs of womanhood. I started speaking out against what I saw as the very real sexism of the trans community: equating sexist stereotypes with being feminine. Not long after, I got a comment from him warning me to ""be careful"" because I was starting to ""sound kinda TERFy.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this time, I was a lib fem. I knew that being a ""TERF"" meant I was fair game for threatening with death and rape. I didn\'t want that, but I also didn\'t want to shut up about what I saw as very important things. By this point, a male friend I knew through the asexual community (at the time I identified as ace, and that\'s a whole other story xD) was transitioning as well. He began wearing Lolita clothing (a Japanese street fashion whose namesake comes from a terrible book) and identifying as a ""lesbian"" because he was dating a woman. He too began posting little witticisms about trans-identified men needing to conform to femininity in order to be perceived as women, while women never have to do that and are praised for *not* conforming. I realized soon enough where my contradictions lay: I couldn\'t say femininity was an awful girdle women were shackled into while also chanting that men can become women with makeup and hair extensions. This was around the same time I began admitting to my sister that I am not comfortable with penises (inverted or not), and that maybe I am (as many people say of self-proclaimed aces) a closeted gay person fighting internalized homophobia. I dropped the ace label, started going as bi, and began speaking out online and offline to my family about gender identity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy online posts led to my ""lesbian"" buddy dropping me, though I know I deleted my FB account because the 40 y/o guy made me really nervous. I started another, more private account for people I actually know. I also found *Feminist Current* while all of this was going on, started reading other thoughts (it collided with a larger political awakening for me as to what it means to be a feminist and part of a political movement) on transgenderism, and came to realize that the ""mean"" women (some of whom are around my age or not much older at all, and more of whom are older and wiser than me) I\'d denounced were right. As a history grad, I remember I was uncomfortable whenever people said things like ""Joan of Arc was trans"" and now I know why: they were erasing her sex, attempting to couch her as a man. That was the tipping point for me: people erasing womanhood and replacing it with sexist stereotypes of women, stereotypes women literally could not and in many places/circumstances still cannot break out of for fear of repercussions (often physical violence).', 'I peak trans every time when I go to a ""queer"" social gathering and there are mostly couples consisting of a TIM and a female ""enby""/TIF and TIMs who are crossing every personal boundary and being overly sexual towards me and other women (weirdly enough, not to other TIMs even though they constantly preach that you can\'t tell who\'s trans).\n\nI\'m a gnc lesbian in her twenties with a lot of internalised lesbophobia still in me and can\'t find a community to go to, to heal, to see my sexuality as normal. I transitioned and reidentified in my teens and now see gender from a more nuanced perspective. But still, I cannot accept my lesbian self as okay and healthy. There is no media, no communities.\n\nOf course there are some ""normie"" lesbian websites and clubs but as a woman interested in academia and politics, they don\'t suit my needs very well. I want to discuss how the social hierarchies oppress women and lesbians. Uncover the patterns in our thoughts and behaviour.\n\nBut both liberal feminism and the universities are all over ""girld*ck"" and centering ""trans women"" in feminism. There is a bunch of bisexual and pansexual-identifying straight women making lesbians feel bad because we aren\'t fluid or all-encompassing or experimenting enough, traumatised women involved in BDSM peer-pressuring others into BDSM, talking about freedom through losing control and posting naked pics of them online with captions like ""faggot boi"" or similar.\nIt\'s queer-branded grooming and it\'s terrifying.', '[deleted]', 'On Facebook, my old friend announced that her daughter had hit her period and was asking for some tips and ideas to help her daughter cope with this new change since she wasn\'t handling it well (especially the part that this was something that would happen every month). She said in her post ""I\'ve tried to tell her that every girl feels apprehensive when they start their period, but it will get better with time."" Important context.\n\nI saw one of my SJW friends comment ""Take her out to eat at her favorite restaurant and let her know her emotions are valid."" which was fine. Then I kept reading and found this jewel: ""Also, not to sound annoying, but not every girl feels like she does, not all girls have periods. And some boys have periods too. Be sure to tell her that (when she\'s feeling better, of course) :) ""\n\nUgh, super cringe.', 'Argh, I\'m just really sad. We\'re organising events for next international women\'s day (mostly comedy) and we\'ve been discussing potential names on FB. Someone suggested ""Hysterical"" which is really fun and not too ""preachy"" for a light hearted event. \n\nAnyway someone has shot it down and said ""we shouldn\'t have any references to female organs"" because ""not all women have wombs"".\n\nWtf is it now peak woke to censor female organs entirely to prevent offence?\n\nSecondly hysteria isn\'t medically about wombs at all! It was a diagnosis used to silence, oppress, hurt, and institutionalise women for hundreds and hundreds of years and the only cause was men and not our anatomy. \n\nI feel so outraged and yet I can\'t respond to it. I\'m sure the new name will be about high heels or lipstick. \n\nStop erasing women\'s history and bodies!!!\n', '[deleted]', 'I\'m a male drag queen. I perform an exaggerated version of what society deems to be femininity for entertainment, kicks, fun, whatever; I love doing it and what initially drew me to it was the possibility to mess with rigid gender norms and be outrageous because I\'m gay as fuq and received my fair share of abuse for being \'effeminate\', so I figured I might as well go all out with it.\n\nAt no point in the process did I think this would turn me into a woman; to the contrary, I was doing it precisely because I was a man and wanted to break oppressive binaries. I also would\'ve considered it insulting to the many amazing women I know in my life who weren\'t all makeup and stilettos to claim that I was somehow representing womanhood with what I was doing. Womanhood is an experience I know precious little about and my drag is a way to express myself and maybe, hopefully clamp down on sexism and homophobia in some way, but nooo way would I ever appropriate the female experience for myself.\n\nI\'m also still under 30, which means the drag community was chock-full of trans ideology when I joined it. I\'m naturally laid-back, so if someone tells me they\'re really a woman inside, then I\'m like, alright honey, whatever works for you. It always rubbed me the wrong way though. If you\'re really a woman and performing hyper-sexual femininity, that\'s not drag, that\'s just being a stripper? But again, I don\'t want to be needlessly judgmental. Live and let live, right?\n\nIf I was completely selfish, I would be in a position to ignore all the harmful effects this has, and a lot of other queens seem to be doing just that. We\'re letting people mess themselves up with DIY or rushed hormone therapies much like we ignore each other\'s coke habits. But we\'re also letting ourselves be instrumentalized to push this agenda outside our little weird circles. Somehow me being an unironic man in a dress means I have to stick up for bearded weirdos who claim to be lesbians because ""queer culture"". Fuqqq that. But all I can do to not turn into a pariah is try and avoid actively pushing the message. Speaking out against it would be social suicide.\n\nToday I really peaked though. This bit about ""reclaiming peak trans"" popped up in my tumblr feed:\n\n>For trans folks, peak trans can signify the moments when we’re doing the  most stereotypically trans actions possible. Peak trans means feeling  gender euphoria when we find new clothing that matches our gender. Peak  trans is when we work together with other trans people to solve  community problems. Peak trans is finding a binder that fits just right.  Peak trans is wearing the perfect choker. Peak trans is getting a t4t  tattoo. Peak trans is your first taste of estrogen melting under your  tongue. Peak trans is missing your dose of testosterone and making a  joke about turning back into a woman. Peak trans is getting your first  haircut that matches your gender.\xa0\n\nHow intellectually barren and just outright stupid is that? ""Clothing that matches our gender""? ""Haircut that matches your gender""? Sweetie, I run around in 6-inch heels and 80s rock girl \'dos and it doesn\'t make me a woman. High heels don\'t turn you into a woman. Stop fetishizing yourself. I\'m so absolutely sick of it. If this is brought to its logical conclusion, then all the gender-fuckery I engaged in, hoping it would somehow make people realize how ridiculous their norms are, will have been for naught because apparently I\'m really a woman for performing drag. If you wear pink, you\'re not a man. If you don\'t live up to the jock aesthetic, you\'re not a man.\n\nThat\'s what people in high school thought when they bullied me for ""acting like a fag"". It\'s the most regressive and anti-individualist shit I have ever heard. I\'m beyond peak trans, and that should mean something coming from someone with a closet full of sparkling dresses.', 'I peaked again.\n\nI am in a friendgroup with a TiM, who left his wife and daughter suddenly after deciding to \'transition\'.  I\'m polite to TiM, but don\'t agree that he\'s trans- it is abundantly clear that he has a lot of mental health problems, but I\'d known him since before his sudden transition, and was friends with him.\n\nThis friendgroup is pretty tight-knit, but the TiM has lately been doing things that make me uncomfortable. Recently, we went out for drinks, and I brought my husband since he is also friends with some people in the group, but not the TiM. I am the only female in the group, but the others are nice, respectful, and we just talk about normal stuff and joke around. TiM was a creep to me several times, and ""negged"" and bullied my own fucking husband. He made fun of my husband when he tried to talk to one of the others, and I just felt that TiM\'s tone of voice and everything was really rude toward my husband. When I asked my husband what he thought, he said he thought TiM was incredibly disrespectful and passive-aggressive toward him.\n\nI haven\'t told husband, but TiM was trying to grab at me several times during our drinking time. I\'ve been trying to avoid TiM since then, and have since just started talking to our other friends one-on-one to avoid conflict. \n\nI know I\'m a wimp. But I\'m scared of retaliation if I say something.', 'I found it disturbing to learn that a New York Times transgender columnist who has written (at least two) memoirs about transitioning and family life, in which raising two sons was constantly discussed, now has a young-adult trans daughter.', 'Just when I thought it couldn\'t get worse, I re-peaked last night. My former best friend started identifying as a ""transbian"" back around August, and he flipped shit on the radfem posts I started sharing on tumblr around that time. This individual is very much a hetero guy who wants to be special. He sits at home all day smoking weed, playing video games, collecting knives and swords, and generally being violent. He likes to torture and slowly kill insects for funsies. If he were hit on by another transbian I highly doubt he\'d go for it - his type is moreso the manic pixie dream girl.\n\nI tried to explain that I don\'t hate trans people, I just think a lot of TIMs fetishize womanhood, femininity, and ""reclaiming their girl childhood,"" and that they should be more respectful to not erase the still-real struggles of women. I then explained to him what initially led me to identifying as trans for a few years (a whole bunch of csa!!) and how much happier I am now that I\'ve put in the work to address that dysphoria, and re-identified with my womanhood. He called my trauma ""fleeing"" and that was my first big PTM. I had talked about my abuse with him for years, since a lot of our friendship was based in us both having PTSD, and he acted compassionate until healing from that trauma led me to an opinion he doesn\'t like! Meanwhile he quits his therapists as soon as they say something that doesn\'t give him instant validation. Like, sorry dude, but healing from trauma isn\'t a field of daisies?? Sometimes you have to be faced with some uncomfortable truths in order to move past an obstacle??\n\nAnyway, I made the mistake of looking back at his blog last night and saw a recent picture he posted of his now pierced ""girldick."" No wonder this dude has never had a healthy fucking relationship. Most of his recent posts were selfies fishing for the validation that he\'s no longer been getting from me. It took some time to realize how much emotional labor was expected of me during the course of our friendship, but all in all it\'s been a fucking relief to be rid of this guy. Massive narcissist.', 'OK, after reading here for probably years, I finally created an account to post after my head exploded seeing that on February 28 there is going to be a nationwide community read-in of ""I am Jazz"".  To kids.  I have read this book.  It reinforces the idea that if kids like mermaids or sparkly things, they are DEFINITELY not a boy, and they need to transition. It of course presents transition as rainbow hued happy happy joy joy to be celebrated and admired. I\'m sorry, but I don\'t find those messages progressive or healthy for preschool children, AT ALL.  It\'s confusing at best and awfully regressive.  But, this is the Peak Trans thread, and this was not my Peak Trans, just the straw that finally broke my back and caused me to sign up and post.\n\nPeak Trans was having a friend whose young daughter came out as trans, and watching this issue in her family, which happened a few years ago.  Honestly, before that I was as ra ra pro trans as anyone.  I\'m not a ""lib fem"" - always been against porn and ""sex positive"" stuff.  But I was definitely pro trans because I have always strongly supported gay rights, and I unthinkingly viewed transgender issues as an extension of this.\n\nEncountering the issue on a personal level really changed things for me.  I started asking questions (internally) about how much it really made sense.  What did it really mean if an autistic 16 yo suddenly decided she was a boy and was put on hormones within ONE MONTH?  Was that really a good thing?  Why was her mother distraught, although outwardly very supportive, if this was just a straightforward coming-out story, and the mom was extremely liberal and gay-positive? \n\nI realized I\'d have no trouble at all with a child of my own coming out as gay or lesbian, but I\'d be distraught myself if they said they were transgender and went on hormones and changed their name. Did knowing I would respond that way make me a bigot?  Initially I thought so.\n\nI am not sure how I landed here at GenderCritical, but I did, and I also found ""4th Way Now""- it really gave me a lot of food for thought.  I realized that transgender people like Caitlyn Jenner have next to nothing in common with people like my friend\'s daughter.\n\nThe British feminists who I eventually found on Twitter (again, not even sure how I found them!) have really helped me think through this issue.  I\'m American and I don\'t feel I can be openly gender critical with my progressive or even politically centrist friends.  It would be like saying I think homosexuality is wrong.  They would be horrified.  I do think some people have slight doubts about some aspects of this issue, but if they haven\'t dealt with it in their family they most likely haven\'t probed those doubts too much.  My best friend\'s daughter is a senior in high school, and two of her daughter\'s acquaintances transitioned (FtM) this past year and are now dating each other.  My friend thinks this is a little...strange...but is very insistent that it must be a good thing and they must always have known they were boys, deep down.  I do not think so and I worry for when my kids are older.  My friend also tells me that there is a boy who dresses like a girl in her daughter\'s friend group, and she is very confused because he doesn\'t seem to want to be either a boy or a girl (I guess nonbinary?).  She says her daughter just rolls her eyes when she asks about him, like mom of course you don\'t understand, you\'re old. (How can everyone be taking these teens so seriously, changing the goddamn English language for them, and offering them up for hormonal and surgical alteration...because we all know teenagers would never adopt major behavioral or sartorial changes just to be cool or try to fit in, right???)  \n\nI don\'t want my kids\' teachers reading them ""I Am Jazz"".  Just no.  How can people not see that a book like this a) reinforces gender stereotypes that I thought \'progressive\' people were firmly against reinforcing, and b) confuses the hell out of little kids??  \n\nAnd I don\'t want this stuff to be further normalized.  I\'m a feminist, and in most ways I consider myself a radical feminist - I believe everyone should express themselves as they wish, whether they are male or female.  But I don\'t believe people can change sex and I think that pretending that they can, as a society, is extremely weird and damaging and confusing and so that is why I finally signed up to post here.', 'Just a mini re-peak for me this week, but FFS. Not even the curlyhair sub here on reddit is safe from hand-maidening the TIMs. Most ""progress"" pics and selfies there get a handful of comments at best. A TIM posts about his ""Two year hair/gender transition""? He gets over 400 praising comments, gold and silver. \n\nI can\'t even any more with this.', 'My peak trans moment came in kind of a rush, I remember that, although I can\'t pinpoint an exact event that made me want to get off that liberal feminism nightmare of a ride. I decided to get a feel for the modern political and social activism climate, seeing as a I have been kind of clueless but I don\'t want to be, about a year ago (I\'m 15 - I\'m fairly new to this). For maybe the first 6 months, I was going along with all of the standard points for liberal feminism that id seen others doing. Really, I wasn\'t even thinking about it, just adopting whatever seemed like the correct social attitude and repeating a monotone confirmation of it if anyone asked.\n\nThen....then I saw a little pin (woohoo pinterest) that had vague gender critical themes, that was ""don\'t steal my post you nasty terfs but here\'s my radical aligned gender critical idea but Hey fuck you still"" more than anything. I was like okay, cool, makes sense, I\'ll have to watch out for these so called \'terfs \' though. I accumulated a few more of those points throughout the next few months, still not outright saying I supported any of it, kind of afraid to, but secretly agreeing in my mind. Like I said, I can\'t remember exactly what triggered it, but I went down a Pinterest hole of radical feminism and I was hooked - everything makes sense. The world was tilted at 79° and now it\'s right side up again. \n\nin my day to day real life, I haven\'t experienced hardly any extreme TRA stuff, but I\'m still pretty angry at everything going down. Female biology is super important and we should have every right to discuss and distinguish it, not go back 40 years in time. Lesbians like myself (although again I haven\'t personally experienced much homophobia living in the Bay Area, CA) need to be recognized as actual fucking people with real sexualities and boundaries that cannot be manipulated at the whims of men. Seeing female friends who were slightly uncomfortable with overt femininity suddenly transitioning into boys is very startling and absolutely does not address the actual problems of sexism and society\'s General rejection of woman that they\'re trying to escape. I could keep going.... \n\nPoint is yeah, I\'m totally gender critical and I do not approve of the new trans movement. I am a young lesbian girl, hopefully someday a WOMAN, surrounded by modern trans activism\'s newest recruits, and I will not stand for it.\n\n', '[deleted]', ""I just read a post by a guy on a gay subreddit who described himself as “gay and transgender.” He states that he knows he’s a man, but wishes he’d been born a woman. The post sounded odd, so I decided to do a little detective work. \n\nI looked at his post history, and he’s posted a number of elaborate and detailed sexual fantasies, fantasies of being used by (real) men as a dirty sexual object including many posts on a Masochistic Emasculation Fetish subreddit. (I had no idea such a thing existed.) In other words, the reason he wants to look and dress like a woman is because his concept of performing femininity equates to turning himself into a target for degradation, abuse, and humiliation, straight out of porn. \n\nIf I ever had any doubts that a good bit of the trans phenomenon is fetish/kink related, I no longer do. And are men who know they're men but are into crossdressing as a sexual kink now under the trans umbrella? I can't keep up.  \n"", 'This sub has been hugely eye opening for me. I stumbled on this sub after hearing what awful TERFs you all were - like probably 95% of the general population I had never even heard the word TERF and I had to google what the hell it even meant.\n\nI never really gave the trans issue much thought other than having a bit of a \'live and let live\', attitude to the whole thing. You feel like a woman? Okay cool, what\'s that to me? Like, again, the vast majority of the population I\'d never even heard the word \'cis\'. \n\nSince discovering this sub I have a can\'t believe that there are people saying that \'women have periods\' is transphobic! Or that a man can feel like a woman and go into a womens change rooms or compete on women\'s sporting teams (blocking testosterone doesn\'t magically change a skeleton, muscle mass and heart and lung capacity - it is cheating plain and simple)\n\nHaving worked as a women\'s health nurse, thankfully none of the language police stuff had hit while I was working. There was no, ""men have babies too"" or, ""discussing vaginas as something related to womanhood is transphobic because some women have penises"".  I do wonder about the future though.\n\nIt is a bunch of shit but to be honest, as someone who is a left-leaning but not particularly involved in politics or women\'s groups or anything like that, no-one I know has even heard of most of this stuff and would find it fucking laughable or disturbing or both that some people think that vaginas, periods, childbirth, uteruses, breastfeeding, menopause, PCOS, pap smears have nothing to do with being a woman and thinking otherwise is ""transphobic"" and ""violent"". No-one I know even knows  term ""cis"" is even a thing and would find it ridiculous - probably because it is.\n\nI can\'t think of a single woman I know that would be okay sharing a change room with a man. Most women are not, \'woke\' and dont even know what the fuck \'woke\' even means but they dont want dicks in their change rooms!  I remember as a young teenager, when I first got my period I used to feel so embarrassed when I had to change a pad and I felt like the rustle of packet was echoing around the room as I opened it. I would have been a million times more uncomfortable if there had been a bloke in the stall next to me.', 'I had a kind of peak insight into the problem today when I engaged a non-binary person in another subreddit. It was a surprisingly civil exchange, but what it revealed to me was the extent of the confusion in their thinking. I chalk it up to educations where they\'ve been rewarded for parroting the right opinions rather than being taught to think; they are very unaccustomed to having someone calmly challenge their statements and suggest that, for example, reconfirming gender stereotypes by agreeing that certain things are inherently masculine or feminine, as they do, is regressive, when they\'ve been taught that it\'s uber-progressive. There seems to be no consistent logic in it anywhere, just a lot of statements about feelings. It\'s enough to make one seasick because you can\'t find a frame of reference in it. They think they\'re subverting gender when they\'re actually reifying it, and they can\'t seem to see that. \n\nOne of the points made was that you can\'t criticize someone\'s gender identity because they\'re very attached to it. Well great. I guess we can\'t criticize men for oppressing women anymore because it might hurt their feelings. [Facepalm]\n\nI think once genderists managed to turn gender into an identity instead of seeing it as a field of prescriptive social forces in which we\'re all caught up, it threw a major monkey wrench into the thinking of the gender generation. It\'s encouraged all the wrong sort of navel-gazing. They have been done a terrible disservice. \n\nEdit: When I continued to challenge the ideology, he finally just said that it was about his feelings and sense of ""living his personal truth."" \n\nSecond Edit: I finally proposed a hypothetical situation. What if I were 55 years old, but went by the maxim that ""you\'re only as old as you feel"" and claimed to be 25? Would he go along with that? He said that he would. He would accept me as a 25 year-old even if I was actually 30 years older. Thus I conclude that they have finally achieved complete detachment from objective reality. ', 'I became opposed to trans propaganda when I sort of had my nose repeatedly rubbed in it despite it all being obvious lies.  No, TIMs do not have ""female brains"".  Whatever that means.  No, the existence of intersex people has nothing to do with the fact that you were so porn-addled and incel that you essentially decided that ""if I cannot acquire a waifu, I shall became the waifu"".\n\nMy dislike became somewhat more intense with increasing exposure to members of that community -- like, the extremely high prevalence of older men grooming ""eggs"".  You know how once upon a time there was a pretty silly fear that your boys could be ""turned gay"" by being around gay guys?  Well, in this case, it\'s absolutely real, and I\'ve seen mentally ill or autistic teenagers taken advantage of again and again.  It\'s common enough that every TIM knows what it means to ""hatch eggs"".  Which is scary, to me.\n\nI hate to belatedly join the Reagan-era fear-mongers, but porn is sooooooooo psychologically unhealthy.  All TIMs discovered porn early and developed a much keener appreciation for it than their peers.  I\'m not entirely convinced about ""target location error"" ... because porn causes an explosion in ALL fetishes, and literally anything can become a fetish if you associate it with orgasm (I mean, if I could make a man masturbate in the increasingly prominent presence of any basically nonsexual thing, I could eventually induce a fetish).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;', 'I have had a number of friends (not close friends but friendly acquaintances) who have identified as trans or non-binary over the years and I have always respected their pronouns. I have accommodated the annoying ""they"" pronoun many times and even argued against people who complained that it was grammatically incorrect.\n\nAnyway, what peaked me was a friend of mine who has always struck me as an extremely stereotypical male suddenly started identifying as ""they"" and apparently now is identifying as ""she.""\n\nAbout a year prior to all this, this male person got into an altercation with my boyfriend. It was none too comfortable for me, being the only other person present while they got into a somewhat violent fight (luckily no one was badly hurt -- thanks to the one woman present who was pleading with them to get away from each other), and I was very angry at my boyfriend about it because there was aggression on both sides that could have easily been avoided. My boyfriend has apologized, and is conscious of needing to control his anger, while this other person has never expressed a word of regret.\n\nAnd NOW, this very obviously case of two testosterone-addled MEN getting into an idiotic and unnecessary fight, has been recast as an incident that is basically a hate crime -- the implication being that this ""woman"" was ATTACKED by a cis-male. It\'s insanity.\n\nThese two have been friends for years, and they have had a lot of problems in their friendship, which to my eye are mostly due to weird, manipulative emotional bullying on the part of the other guy (the term ""crybully"" comes to mind). Now other friends of ours are saying, look at how hard this guy has it, he\'s even lost a close friend just because he decided to express his true gender identity. This is NOT at all why their friendship has had problems.\n\nIt irritates me to no end that this person can just conveniently shuck off all of the privilege and social conditioning that has informed their actions for years, and now claim to be a victim of circumstances that were at least partially of his own making. This person has ogled me and made comments about my body. He is NOT a woman just because he likes wearing nail polish and using dildos. He is NOT someone that I would feel comfortable sharing a female-only space with. He can turn on his ""female"" identity when it\'s convenient for him, and turn it off again when he needs to express his aggression, and the 30 years of male hormones and physical development he has under his belt make him a dangerous person when he needs to be.', 'I hit peak trans when my daughter went from having a crush on a slightly older androgynous girl at school to coming out to us as skoliosexual, to declaring she wanted to be a boy, and within a month she was in an endocrine clinic where they talked about starting ""completely reversible"" puberty blocking treatment right away.\n\nShe\'s 12.\n\nEvery person I asked (the TransActive leader, the pediatric endocrinologist) said that 99%+ of kids given puberty blockers go on to cross-gender hormone therapy and on down the trans trainline.  They said this like it reinforced their idea that all these kids know what\'s best for them.\n\nI do not think that\'s what it means.  \n\nI found her a therapist that was female bodied, identified as gay and said she specialized in gender issues.  Turns out this therapist just wanted to lecture me on gender versus sexuality and advocate for the puberty blockers.\n\nWe are working out every Friday morning with a lesbian personal trainer and my 12 year old can do 2 full pull-ups now, which is awesome.

I\'m letting her wear a binder, but I\'m wondering/worried about it.  I\'m struggling with pronouns.  \n\nI want to be supportive, but not accepting, if that makes any sense.

Age. S*ix*. A little boy who liked to play with dolls and wearing his mom\'s dresses decided he was a girl when his dad told him that princesses were for girls, when he was two. He was taken from therapist to therapist, until one told the parents to make the kid transition. And so his mother started fighting for his right to legally change gender, sign him up at school as a girl, all that jazz.  His dad questioned this, but the parents got divorced and his mother was completely supportive of her kid\'s gender identity so the process of transition began. \n\nAnd so this gender non-conforming kid is now waiting until he can finally get on puberty blockers. Life-altering drugs with terrible side effects, all  because parents don\'t know how to deal with a boy who likes dolls and Disney Princesses. A two year old does\'t know what gender is. He only knew that he wanted to  play with dolls, and they told  him dolls are for girls so hey, then he\'s a girl. Now, the choice was taken from him. Nobody knows if he would have been an effeminate man, a gnc man, or a completely gender-conforming guy who just liked ""girl toys"" for a while when he was a toddler, because is life has been decided for him thanks to sexist stereotypes and conservative parents, and a society so rotten that it celebrates a mother\'s delusion that her son is not a son because he ""acts like a girl"".\n\nLearning about this and other stories of parents transitioning their kids was my breaking point, where I couldn\'t deal with the cognitive dissonance it would take for me to believe this was alright.

I would also see stuff about TERFs, and how they\'re no good. \n\nThis just kept wearing away at me, until finally i went on some of these ""terf"" blogs and began reading about radical feminist views on gender and such. I began questioning to find what was really bothering me about this whole ""trans women are (real) women"" and it was this: how do you define woman? I see myself as a woman and have grown  up being perceived as 1, so what makes trans women see themselves as women? I questioned more; i thought of very feminine trans women and though ""just because they dress up feminine and wear makeup, and maybe exhibit some girly characteristics doesnt make them women...definitely not. Being a woman cant be defined by something on its own so shallow as being \'girly\' (being this way isnt shallow just pinpointing being a woman 2 this 1 thing is, so what about women who arent?) \n\nI finally realized i defined being a woman as being biologically female, with the added bonus of being socialized because of this reality. I also dont believe in gender, i just think everyone has a unique personality, and their personal qualitie, hobbies, values, etc. shouldnt be defined whether they\'re male or female. At this point i still cant see what makes trans women, women; they aren\'t biologically and there\'s no particular mentality that makes a women, women are just people. In a way it just seems like dress up. \n\nI dont hate trans people at all, and i do want them to have the support they need, but i dont think that means ignoring simple facts.', 'It\'s hard to name one peak trans moment. I keep reaching new peaks. The first time I started to doubt the trans narrative was when my then-boyfriend said of a trans friend of his, ""It\'s a good thing they can correct birth defects like that now days."" That struck me as really wrong. Being born in a healthy male body is not a birth defect, no matter how much you may wish it was a female body.  That was before I found radical feminism and I just brushed it aside and went on believing most of what the trans cult said.\n\nWhen I first found radical feminism, I was immediately on board with all of it except the gender critical part.

I hate that I have a receding hair line. I have ""boyish""/straight figure - no boobs/ass...I hope no one looks at me and thinks I\'m trans :( .

I think at the moment trans people often get siderooms (totally unfair IMO, especially if this means someone who actually needs the sideroom for infection or end of life reasons). I hope to god no grieving family has had to sit with their dying family member in a 6 bedded bay just because they had to put a trans person in the sideroom.

I have an IUD, which has made my cycles completely random. Sometimes I’ll have cramping / spotting for months at a time and other times I will have felt absolutely nothing for half a year. I have a chronic illness that leaves my brain in a constant state of sleep deprivation so I have a limited ‘energy’ pool (see: [the spoon theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/)). \n\nSo when I’m cramping super badly, my brain literally is too exhausted dealing with the pain that I can’t fully control my emotions. I notice when I get in these states I have no patience for trans ideology especially TIMs. I’ll be on my bathroom floor in fetal position crying in pain, almost wishing I could stab my uterus out to stop it. I’ll think about how hungry I am but how I can’t keep food down because my whole system is fucked. And then I’ll think about the patriarchy and the fact that I can’t even openly talk about this experience. Eventually without fail I’ll think about TIMs and get super pissed off. It’s like every experience I have because I was born woman - I didn’t get to choose and I can’t change that - will flash before my eyes and I just feel so fucking offended. This experience can’t be erased. I didn’t choose my body. I didn’t choose this identity. Not because of my boobs. Not because of my vagina. Not because my hormones. After all, women are different we aren’t a recipe with exact measurements. But I was just born with a female body that I learn to navigate and just experience. If I woke up tomorrow magically in a male appearing body with my memory intact, I would vividly recall my bathroom floor and I don’t think I could identify as a man even then. \n\n\nDon’t know if I’m alone in that, but I use to be an ally, have lots of friends in the community, etc, and yet, I knew I couldn’t be around any of those people during bad cycles. \n\n___\n\n\nBut I also have this distinct peak situation that doesn’t  coincide with my cycle. In college I took a class on gender and sexuality. I was still trying to figure out a lot things out, but I was particularly interested in the linguistic side. I found it interesting in all the works we read no one ever defined woman, female, or girl, but often times used them interchangeably. And generally those words must mean something. It seemed as if biology was a big connecting factor. I just thought it was cool that there was all this feminist literature that never defined ‘woman’ but all seemed to imagine the same thing. \n\nAnyways, I thought it was a pretty harmless paper. When I got it back, my professor just wrote “This is problematic. D” Horrible grade. No notes just that comment. At first, I was so confused. I wasn’t sure who it was problematic against, but later I realized my paper was accidentally trans-exclusionary. I wasn’t thinking about trans people at all while writing as I was just so focused in exploring the relationship between sex and gender. That definitely started getting me more on peak mountain. I just didn’t feel comfortable with this sort of implicit erasure of natal women. \n\nThat professor absolutely hated me after that. (I got a C- in the class.) She would tsk and shake her head every time she saw me.  She was also the advisor for like those crazy Tumblr-y students who were famous campus wide for their activism. That type made up the majority of my class and I remember the exact moment that I felt like a sane person in insane asylum. We read the novel *Monsieur Vénus*, which was weird but interesting. The ending, however, is bat shit insane. (Spoiler: The main character grieves the death of her lover by making a wax sex puppet with his nails and hair glued on and it’s rigged to kiss her back.) \n\nI walked into class expecting everyone to be like “Yeah that was such a weird ending and she totally has mental problems ending!!”. No, no, no. Somehow this was not only accepted and normalized, but man romanticized this. The class came to an agreement (I sat alone in horror) that she wasn’t crazy, she just was trans and acting out masculinity? Sure it was a little unhealthy, but like, she was finding her identity~. I just was SO uncomfortable. The main character clearly had some mental problems that just made her obsess with identity to the point of madness and like this wasn’t... good... this was not like an indicator of how society should be progressive. To me, I thought this emphasized the need for better mental health care... \n\nThe group of tumblr-y people had so manyyyyyy issues generally. They were kind of friend adjacent to my friend group, so I heard about their interpersonal issues often and boy were they unnecessarily insane. It wasn’t cool to identify as anything on a binary and everyone’s sexuality became fuzzy. The most extreme identified as a house cat with the pronoun “it”. They all entered college pretty stable with their identities, but by the end of it they were all over the place and they infected part of my friend group. One female lesbian in particular was hit hard. She by the end of first year shaved her head (hair was too feminine apparently) and changed her pronouns. (Tbqh i can’t remember anyone’s pronouns because they are all different and most of them time it wasn’t he/him or she/her it was like vim/vi/zer/zix/they/it/xi/shim) Anyways, she just didn’t feel feminine so she was naturally pressured to be trans, which confused her a lot. After moving into a apartment together, this group started having romantic / sexual relationships with each other which made them all go even farther into dysfunction. Lots of TIMs who aren’t feminine whatsoever and everyone trying to woke / accepting of each other  lead to lesbians being with men then starting to feel intense feelings of repulsion leading to problems with sexual assault and alcohol abuse. And since society is oppressive not these woke folks they had a lot of problems with getting support or calling out the bad behavior within their own group because they focused so much on everyone who wasn’t like them. That girl has been in a psych ward since graduation a few years ago. \n\n\nI guess overall I peaked in college watching a dumpster fire of a situation where TRA confuses people to the point of madness and where womanhood gets erased. Also, having bad periods makes me very unsympathetic to the idea that I can change how I was born just because I wished it to be so.', 'Inasmuch as I could be said to have had a ""peaktrans"" moment, it\'s the proliferation of histrionic, biology-denying manifestos such as this (courtesy of something called ""Pink & Black Anarchists"" on Facebook):\n\n""Trans women are women.

Trans women deserve access to women- only spaces. Trans women deserve respect.""\n\nNote that I don\'t hate trans people, nor do I oppose, generally speaking, their fight for civil rights. It is simply that I object to loopy ideology such as this, where penises can somehow be intrinsically female.', 'Shit, I\'m peaking all over the place. It\'s like I can\'t go anywhere on the internet anymore without this bullshit being shoved in my face. I had to make a new account to post here or else I\'ll be booted from other subs that have *nothing* to do with feminism or politics or activism at all! \n\nAnyway there\'s a regular series on this site I like where they scan pictures of old magazines and comment on them. (It\'s more fun than it sounds, promise.) The latest one was a teen girl magazine from 1967. So, of course, there were a bunch of ads for pads & tampons in it. Annnnd of course some tim had to go off on the comments about how his dysphoria was triggered by ""another piece of [his] girlhood being ripped away.""\n\n*EXCUSE ME BUT WHAT THE FUCK?!* You are *not* a girl, you will never *be* a girl, and you\'re sitting there fetishizing something that makes women the world over miserable. \n\nI\'m in a shitposting group on FB that I might have to leave since it\'s getting infested.

""Ummm, like, men can and do get pregnant 💅""\' ummm like no they fucking can\'t, Brittany. \n\nI don\'t know how controversial this stance is in this sub but I think there is such a thing as gender dysphoria, some people are genuinely wired wrong, but it\'s exceedingly rare. I mean there are men who quietly transition, call themselves Carol and keep to themselves. It\'s the transtrenders with porn star names that demand to be part of every discussion and the center of attention in all women\'s topics that irritate the hell out of me.', 'What ultimately led to me questioning the trans movement was a pregnancy scare. I had screwed up with my birth control and was terrified. I took the morning after pill and felt so nauseous I had to leave work. I had nightmares about pregnancy for weeks, where I woke up in a cold sweat and shaking. I read everything I could get my hands on about abortion, the different procedure options, the distance to the nearest clinic. How to hide it from my hyper-religious parents, especially my father. I wasted test after test in the days that followed, even though I knew that it was too early for them to be accurate. \n\nYou could say that it was a relief when my period finally came. \n\nA few days later, I was browsing one of the liberal feminist Facebook pages I followed, when a particular post caught my eye: ""It\'s \'dude-rus\', not \'uterus\'"".\nA few days later, a different page was encouraging ""cis allies"" to scribble over the words ""female"" and  ""feminine"" on packages of tampons and pads in grocery stores. \nI couldn\'t articulate what frustrated me so much at the time, but now I understand: female erasure taken literally. I already felt like I couldn\'t talk to anyone about the pregnancy scare, out of shame and guilt. Now here I was being silenced again, in a different way.', ""I was living the libfem life until a TIF presenter at an education session I was required to go to on trans issues at my last job said that sex wasn't real; it's assigned arbitrarily at birth based on how long your penis/clitoris is.

It\'s a sub dedicated to mocking incels....men who want to define womens lives. Yet they use the slur ""terf"" to describe women who....want to define their own lives.\n\nI\'m getting angrier and angrier about this word ""terf"". It\'s complately dehumanizing.  Did any young nazi think in 1934 that the Jews he was dehumanizing as vermin,  lice and evil world controllers would be standing on the edge of pits and he\'d be killing them?\n\nDid anyone think 5 years ago women could be arrested for tweeting we are adult females?', 'Another long post, but not sure how to shorten it and still do the story justice. \n\nI have never really given much thought to trans rights, other that to support their right to live their lives as individuals. If they want to dress and act like a women, whatevs. I support individuality with anyone and still do. My snapping point was also related to a pregnancy. \n\nIn 2014, I suffered a Partial Molar Pregnancy resulting in Choreocarcinoma, a pregnancy related cancer. Within a week of finding out my baby (actually a non viable fetus but for 10 weeks excited I was pregnant) had no heartbeat, I had my  DNC a week later, then a week after, pathogy results came back and I had to start chemo a week from that. It all went very quickly.\n\nThere are many emotions that stem from this going through the stages of grief: the loss of my baby, omg I’m going to die, wtf my baby tried to kill me, etc etc.. very dark times. I was in a partial molar pregnancy fb group with women from around the world who suffered the same fate. Its difficult for women who hadn’t gone through this to understand the depths of this pain but many women can relate at least on the miscarriage and/cancer portion but both stemming from the same event.. it was hard finding a true support group of those who walked the same path. But I did. However, this is something no man could relate to on any level. I had a wonderful network of friends and family help get me through such a difficult time though. \n\nDespite chemo typically causing weight loss, that wasn’t the case with me as I was bedridden for the better part of a year, possibly a year and a half that stretched to almost two with the depression aspect. When I finally started looking to lose weight, I really wanted to sign up for Curves, being one of my first steps back into the world. I needed support of women for many reasons, some being emotional breakdowns, some being physical issues on my lady parts such as needing super plus pads and super plus tampons lest I bleed right through both and soaking my clothes, an issue only women can really understand. I wasn’t comfortable with a normal gym for fear of embarrassment but I knew in a group of ladies, if I had issues, I would have been embarrassed but I also would’ve had full support to help with anything I needed. \n\nWhen looking for a Curves near me, I saw article after article about how they were coming under fire for being exclusive and may even have to shut their doors. This was also around the same time the “restroom” issue was coming under fire. I was conflicted on this as well as I had never really cared. At home everyone shares bathrooms and even many restaurants in my city had gone to unisex anyway. But they were individual rooms, not shared stalls. Again, my concerns arose about having a bloody mess in a public restroom.   Just for context, my husband and I were at a restaurant (I braved it for the day) and I bled through and dripped from the outside patio all the way to the indoor restroom and was mortified.)  I had both a pad and a tampon, only on/in for about 2 hours but the flood happened. \n\nThe more I started researching and realize how far the trans rights movement had gone, stepping into territory they could never appreciate the magnitude of, the more upset I got. No man could ever fathom what it’s like to be a woman. \n\nThis does not even take into account periods from puberty, getting hit on by gross men from a young age, made to feel uncomfortable and trying to hide in my own skin to be invisible, dressing down to avoid unwanted harassment... as many women have faced.\n\nThis also absolutely does not take into account the rights women throughout history have fought for: voting, women in the workplace, in sports, etc. Men are hijacking (is that the right word, applicable to all, not exactly but I don’t know what is) the women’s efforts to get even this far. \n\nMen have dominated women for centuries and to me this feels like they are undermining the true women’s movement. They have never struggled through what we have gone through. Women wake up women, for better or worse, without makeup, without medication, good or bad, we suffer or thrive as women who can all at least somewhat relate to each other on a level no man could ever understand. \n\nThis got longer than expected but this is the first time I’ve ever found a place I can actually vent this story to, as I would get slaughtered sharing my thoughts anywhere else. It’s been very lonely feeing this way.', 'My trans friend keeps incoherently tweeting about how ""the fascists are coming for the transwomen first"" and ""they already have concentration camps for transwomen"". \n\nI\'m sorry, but just look at what\'s happening at the border.

I\'ve seen a youngish TIM (under 30) engage with an older woman (+55) this way: on several occasions he has repeatedly called her ""young lady,"" and often tells her, ""Oh, you look so young and beautiful today."" Well, she doesn\'t like this, and she tells him, but the TIM ignores her requests to stop, giggles, and continues the schtick. The woman looks like an old woman (lined features, the face of a lot of lived experience, etc.), and does not prioritize appearance (she doesn\'t use makeup and wears plain, sensible clothing. She\'s said that his treatment of her is growing more and more annoying. In a way it\'s sad: I imagine that the TIM (a man with a fixation on feminine beauty, a man who, honestly, is not attractive as a female...at all) believes he is helping her by serving up delusion, but she\'s just not buying it. I hope she, finally, with compassion and courage, can just tell him the truth: that making the attainment of young, feminine beauty your top priority (versus seeking excellence in skills, character, understanding, etc.) is a fool\'s errand..... But, even if she did, I doubt that the TIM would get it...like many other TIMs, his transitioning has more to do with taking on gendered, stereotypical femininity than in actually identifying with or even understanding real women.\n\nEdited for clarity', 'I have peaked so many times in the past couple of years that it is ridiculous.

I still got messages from some men who seemed pretty nice and talked to them a bit as I was bored and they didn\'t seem overtly sexual.

I found that there were a few women only meetings which made me feel safer walking into a new space in such a vulnerable state in my life. I also live in a big city, so feeling safe in public spaces is always top priority. The one I chose explicitly listed ""Trans Women Welcome"". It was the closest one I could find and I liked the ""inclusion"" aspect of it. So ""radical"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was only one TIM in the meeting. Her name was Tamy and she was a 6\'8 300 pound middle aged white woman wearing a zebra print low cut dress for all of us to gaze upon her breasts.

Women would share their stories about low self worth, trying to find meaning in their life, their abusive relationships with men, rape. But Tamy was once homeless, sucked dick for money, and was also abused by men. She painted a picture of a truly horrible life and while I felt empathy for however much of it was true, these stories seemed to come after another woman shared a deeply traumatic story connected to her experience being a woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen one day I walked into the meeting and there was a straight up man sitting in the circle. He looked like the kind of guy who worked in a hole-in-the-wall mechanic shop on the outskirts of town. When he introduced himself, he said his name was Gizelle. (GIZELLLEEEEEE) Tamy had apparently picked him up off the streets to clean him up and get him into recovery. I was deeply uncomfortable. I tried to get cue\'s from the other women like ""what is going on?"" ""is this okay?"" and everyone just went along with the act. Gizelle\'s stories were also the most gut wrenching in the group.

Tamy said ""I WAS RAPED SO NONE OF YOU HAD TO BE"", painting a picture as a martyr of protection for the women in the group. I then learned that Tamy had a history of going to all the women-only meetings in the area, getting into administrative positions in each group to force them to use inclusive language, and where similar instances had occurred in other circles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rage set the fuck in.

There are also countless stories of male predators who use AA to assault and abuse women. Tamy and Gizelle infiltrated a female space that was created to avoid the above pervasive presence of sexual violence and then threatened us with it, and did so by forcing the women in the group to identify them as women.

I believed that if trans people felt so strongly about it, the right thing to do was being accepting and supportive.\n\nI almost peaked when I heard of the cotton ceiling. I found the term is disgusting and rapey, and I was surprised that trans people kept using it even when other women clearly felt and had expressed the same.

I binged on the sub and determined that there were a lot of good points being made, and that the practice of fully accepting trans people as their desired gender was a lot more complicated than I had cared to think about.\nI had seen several of Contrapoints’ videos and had found them mostly intelligent and well-reasoned, so I went to review some old videos to try to make sense of all this new information and, what luck, she had just made a video on Gender Critical! Aaand, then I peaked.\n\nThere was such a stark contrast between the sympathy shown to incels, a group that has literally inspired murderers, and the clear hostility against gender critical women. And I wondered why she didn’t address what I understand to be the biggest concerns: the push for medical transition of children and how forced inclusion of transwomen into women’s spaces affects women’s safety and opportunities. I realized it was likely because she doesn’t agree that these things should be concerning, that most trans people just don’t think these things should be concerning, and such a huge difference in opinion, priorities, and values just seems unbridgeable.', 'Watching chilling adventures of Sabrina.

Then it’s about patriarchy in the coven, very interesting, very nice, love it. Strong female lead. BUT the basketball girl discovered that indeed, the fact that she love boys clothes and basketball means that she is a boy. Wow much woke. Very feminism. I thought girls that loved «\xa0men’s stuff\xa0» were valid girls, and that boys who were «\xa0feminine\xa0» were valid boys, and that it’s just the society pushing stereotypes on us.

Like they always talking about guys hitting on them or cat calling them. Or their retort in any argument  is always “ your man probably wants to fuck me” or “I probably get more dick then you”.  Like that matters in any way, shape or form. (Side note: Most guys who are into TIMs are often deeply closeted gays or complete fucking perverts and women won’t tolerate it.) \n\nIt’s like they think that a women’s only value is how fuckable she is. That women are only valuable if she can fulfill men’s fantasies.', 'I first came to this forum not because of trans peak but rather polyamory peak. So this is a bit off topic, but I thought I would introduce myself nevertheless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in a small country in northern Europe, and polyamory is not really maintream here, but there is a small community which is working very hard to expose the general public to the concept. There was a series of tv programs following a young polyamorous couple, a blog in one of the popular afternoon papers etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more I learned about it the more I didn\'t like it. It seemed to often be an excuse for not regarding the feelings of ones partner and making into their problem if they are hurt by your actions. In the polyamorous culture it is apparently normal to refer to your partners feelings as ""shit"" as in ""deal with your own shit"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems to me that more often than not polyamory is about someone (often a man)  wanting to have both the security of a stable relationship and the excitement of casual sex on the side. And they then manage to gaslight their partner to believe that it is selfish and unloving and unwoke not to agree to this enthusiastically. In polyamory there seems to often be someone living in permanent misery and heartbreak working very hard to suppress strong negative feelings that are deemed unacceptable, even sinful, by the community. Any grief and pain of being betrayed and abandoned and generally walked all over is labeled as ""jealousy"", which is shameful and embarassing and should be ""worked on"", i.e. suppressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I searched the internet to see if anyone had anything to say about the subject of polyamory that did not sound like blind unconditional praise from brainwashed cult members, but all I found was glossy pictures of couples that were 100% unproblematically living in polyamory, tips on how to turn your partners deep pain into enthusiastic consent by wearing them down over time, claims that polyamory is at the same time the height of evolution and the way nature intended, etc. etc. Not one critical thought. Until I came across r/GenderCritical. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere I found sane people not afraid of thinking heretic thoughts. Common sense, sanity, critical thinking. It was like someone opened the window and let the air in after all the groupthink and mindless repeating of woke slogans I had been exposed to while researching polyamory. I also learned that I am not alone in my views on feminism and the whole identity culture thing that flourishes on certain campuses even in this country. Thtere is a word for it: Radical feminism. I don\'t know much of the theory behind it, but it is such a relief to find a bit of sanity online, a place where we can call things by their right name without fear of repercussion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo every once in a while have popped in here to see that I am not alone in the world, and today I finally created my own account.', 'I just saw a trans activist ranting about the Georgia abortion ban and all of the attacks on Roe vs Wade.

The selfishness is blinding.', 'I\'ve been lurking for a month or two and am very grateful to have found a community of intensely smart women who are free thinking feminists. I made this account to post here because my main has too much personal info.\n\nMy peak trans moment was a few years back when my little brother came out as trans. The first time we hung out after he had come out (and holy shit is it a relief to call him by the correct pronouns), he was wearing a sports bra with cutlet padding, the floppy realistic kind, and kept going on and on and *on* about my boobs this and my boobs that in the new ""feminized"" voice he was affecting.  He bragged that his boobs would be the biggest out of all the siblings (four skinny girls and one skinny boy) after taking hormone therapy, like breast size was somehow a competition between sisters rather than a physical aspect which we notice but ascribe no value to.  All I could think at the time was how he was still just as obsessed with boobs as any man, only now he felt free to impose that obsession on me, his older sister, to my extreme discomfort.\n\nFurthering my disgust with his behavior, he shared how excited he was to induce lactation once the size of his breast tissue increased.  As a libfem back then, I was trying to be supportive and ""accept her for who she is"" but the lactation thing stopped me dead in my tracks.  I asked why and said that lactation isn\'t something women do for fun and found out his answer was to sell videos of it online.  I almost started crying when I found out that my little brother\'s idea of womanhood was boobs and making money from lactating boobs through perverts on the internet.  Considering he was openly a misogynist only a year or two before coming out as trans, I was just so confused by this turn of behavior.\n\nI can\'t really talk to him much anymore besides the most superficial stuff.  I feel really strongly that he did absolutely no work on his depressed/suicidal/dissociative mental state before deciding to transition (which he only ever became interested in after dating a TIF), but now uses his trans status to give name to the class/wealth based oppression he experienced as a kid so poor he and my dad didn\'t have electricity or running water, because without the trans status he\'s just another straight white male bitching (albeit with good reason) about being poor.\n\nThe final peak moment related to my brother was hearing him call himself a lesbian.  Clearly, heterosexual intercourse is not homosexual intercourse, no matter how much makeup and padding is involved.  I used to think he was smart, but now I just think he got brainwashed in his desperate search for love, approval, and community.', 'A rant undeserving of a post: \nHonest, genuine question: what have trans women done for cis women? I see calls for “cis” women to “support their sisters, not just their cisters”, etc. but have trans women ever helped liberate “cis” women in any way? \n\nAll that I can think of transwomen doing for women is actively and violently trying to silence them for trying to organize/expressing their concerns, perpetuating oppressive stereotypes and the assumption that we “identify” with the male defined version of woman, decentering/diluting conversations about women’s health, and terrifying lesbians to the point of near silence. \n\nIf you want me to support you, why are you dismissing my very legitimate experiences and concerns? I’ve said it before and I’ll probably say it again, it’s peak male entitlement. Transideology is a fucking Trojan horse, tricking women into feeling safe so that men can possess our very identities.

The entire schpeal was meant to garner attention and discussion around this person\'s own sexual pleasure and need to get laid. 25 other people were there, about 20 of whom never got to speak.', ""I peaked long ago but I've some more real life peaks! I've started attending more lesbian events lately after a long break and there is always at least one TIM at every event, if not two or three out of a group of maybe 15-20 people altogether. This one guy was like six foot, calls himself a name that one would heavily relate to lesbian culture and history and identifies as a lesbian. He's a 6'3 man with a ponytail and a stuffed bra who routinely posts shit about 'fuck terfs' into the facebook group with knife emojis, or giving out about lesbians excluding TW. The posts get likes, but never any comments, which is unusual compared to everything else that gets posted. Even within the events, I can see that none of the women there want to talk to him but they're all just smiling politely, trying to get into another conversation. You'd be afraid to say to the group that you're like, a standard model boring lesbian who is only attracted to females and it makes me sad that thats honestly something I'm too afraid to say in public anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother occasion at another queer event for women (all in their very early 20s), we again had three transwomen, none having taken any steps to transition and were all very clearly men. That would have been one thing, what pissed me off is they were wearing like an anime inspired school uniform outfit. Like thigh high socks, short pleated skirt, crop top thing - it was so obviously overtly sexual. I ended up at a table with them somehow and again, spent twenty minutes listening to how terfs are the worst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think thats what I wish people understood about TIMs in lesbian spaces. Even one of them totally changes the vibe of the space. It censors everyone because not only do you have to dance around someones mad identity, you also have to dance around how clearly sexualised the whole thing is. I love hanging out with lesbians because everyone is quite boisterous, lots of explicit jokes, lots of stuff I would never say around my straight friends for fear of accidentally arousing the men. Now I'm back in the same situation where I'm worried anything I say even around lesbians thats a bit risque is going to be used as masturbation material later by these weirdos."", 'Peak trans hitted me when I started reading stories of men fetichizing menstrual products and saying they have periods too.', ""In honor of Peak Trans VIII, here's an image gallery of assorted re-peak moments accumulated over the past six months: https://imgur.com/a/X7JZEht (very NSFW)\n\nAlso, shout out to r/itsafetish for telling it like it is.\n\nEdit: Surprise, surprise, Imgur has taken this down.

He also repeatedly talked like he knew everything about lesbian politics and issues just because of his drag experiences and expected me to be into trans women, like I didn't have a choice.\n\nI would like to also add the general expectations of uber liberal society and the whole social justice thing has always been a weird turn-off.

Dating was pretty much non-existent, but I had the internet at least.  I watched a lot of Xena, bought a lot of rainbow shit, and was generally very comfortable in my own skin.

For one, I had a different Reddit account which I used across various subreddits. I actively participated in a lot of the indie related communities because I prefer to support small buisnessses, and women owned brands. I remember I posted a picture wearing a lipstick I just purchased, and loved, and relayed it back to me finally getting out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I ended up receiving a direct message from someone complimenting me and I thought nothing of it. However this TIM proceeded to message beyond the compliment he said ""I wish I had a cute girlfriend like you so we could go out and find Daddies"". I was thrown off because I\'m not into anything like that,\'or have I ever made a mention of anything relating to that and even moreso most of my comments in my post history were talking about me focusing on myself. My education, career, mental health, hobbies, and creating/building strong healthy relationships with other women, which is something I\'ve always lacked. He continued to message me although I didn\'t reply to that, and I\'m paraphrasing now but pretty much his messages were all about him using me to get straight men to have sex, as in a threesome, and for me to help dress him up because he was a ""fairy"". I lost it there because how can someone have the nerve? My existence isn\'t to pander to men, or to help other men with a weird fetish trick straight men. That\'s awful. I couldn\'t believe that there are men like that creeping in mainly women followed/interacting spaces trying to pass along like they\'re just one of the girls. It\'s so off putting. \n\nI\'ve always been weary of trans people, and even moreso now. I looked a bit through this subreddit and Itsafetish and I\'m very grossed out that these TIM\'s think being cat-called is validating. That made me feel physically ill. I live in a place that is high on sex-trafficking in the US and I\'m on guard 24/7. I\'ve been followed both on foot, and in the car, and cops do next to nothing. Cat-calling isn\'t validating, it\'s not fun, or cute, it doesn\'t make me feel dainty or attractive. It\'s gross, annoying, and even if it\'s not in a dangerous situation like at night/me alone I still feel gross inside. How could these men sexualize something that has gotten so many of us harmed, raped, killed? \n\nAlso, reading about how many TIMS get their jollies rustled by buying bras and underwear is disgusting. It\'s undergarments. It\'s not something new. I have a niece that\'s going through puberty and honestly I would raise hell if a TIM was in the store shopping with a hard on in a dress. My niece doesn\'t need to be exposed to that. She\'s already so unaware and unsure of her changing body as is. And what\'s with the whole ""I shaved my legs I feel like a real girl"". Do they really think that\'s what being a woman is about? Or the tweet from that TIM that said ""trans women are biological women"". Umm what? \n\n\nI\'m really grateful for this subreddit. It\'s given me so much more information and knowledge than I could have ever know about on my own.

At the beginning it was alright, but it very quickly descended into abuse. She would berate me, ignore me, manipulate me, and even cheat. It got so bad, to the point where she would require that I send her my work schedule, respond at night, and if I got too busy she would get mad at me. Our relationship was based on her anger, but she only ever wanted people to see her ""soft girly side"". She was nothing but a rough monster to me. She lived for others attention, others approval so badly. If she\'s not the perfect girl to everyone she would have a breakdown, and of course I\'d be on the other side of her rude comments and abandonment. Things only got worse, and admittedly I was very alone and became dependent on her abuse so I waited for her to get tired of me and end it first. Whenever she felt dysphoric she would treat me the worst. I tried buying her clothes and taking her places, but she wouldonly hate it and lash out at me. \n\nFew months later after the breakup, we have a conversation. I ask her what was her reasoning. Of course it was bullshit rationalization but 2 things in particular stuck out. 1, she would blame me for her dysphoria. She said my SINCERE compliments made her feel fake, so she would take it out on me. 2, she hated me because I was good. Now I don\'t mean to brag, but I am very sweet and often too forgiving and caring of others.  \n\nNow, I was already looking into the community before but that was the moment that it clicked inside of me. SHE was a TIM. He really was just like every other guy, insecure of their accomplishments, sexually repressed, angry and itching to make their lack of responsibility someone else\'s problem. It all made sense. I scanned back and saw it all. He would use me for rides around town but whenever it was inconvenient to him he\'d be ""busy"", wanted access to my friends but got mad when I would see them without her, deeply insecure and would use me to cope, was a sexual brat, and would be angry and frustrated at everything that didn\'t go his way. \n\nWhen I vented about my trauma some people had the audacity to tell me to ""say she"".

This is the APA... as in the *American Psychiatric Association.*\n\nAlso, it\'s got  something to do with a having a term that won\'t be used against trans people in ""social, occupational or legal areas."" Because apparently it\'s okay if other mental illnesses are used to discriminate against the people who have them!!! You\'ve got to make a special exception for the trans as always.\n\nI am in a slow-boiling rage right now, I might be too mad to be articulate. But... *great* to see the *American Fucking Psychiatric Association* agree that you can\'t sully trans people with the terrible stigma of mental illness!  Dear gosh, no, we can\'t be having that.\n\nAnd I might be a bit less mad if being trans *wasn\'t* so clearly linked to various mental and social dysfunctions. Mental illness shouldn\'t be stigmatised, and maybe also, APA, you *shouldn\'t be throwing all other mentally ill people under the fucking bus* in order to pretend that trans people are a special sort of non-disordered mentally-well people who just happen to need lifelong medical treatment for a condition which exists entirely in their own minds... and also tend by coincidence  have a shitload of comorbid personality disorders, dissociation, trauma histories and creepy as fuck sexual paraphilias with their completely non-disordered mental wellness condition.\n\nSo yeah seems like the APA has established that the tiny matter of being *entirely delusional about your identity* including your relationships to other people and your relationship with your body, is totally a normal thing that happens to mentally healthy people, and the comorbidities with mental illness are just all a weird coincidence. The important thing of course is that we spare trans people from the terrible fate of being understood to have a *mental illness*... god forbid, someone please transport me to the Trans Fainting Couch so I can have a conniption and the vapours at the mere thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;', 'I\'ve always had a small issue with queer theory and how gender can be purely socialization but trans people can still exist if they were socialized as the opposite gender that the identify as. But I mainly ignored these feelings because I do think trans people are people and deserve to be treated as such. However, I\'ve peaked over the past few days. I\'ve especially been skeptical of the ""female brain in a male body"" claim as I don\'t feel I have a ""female brain"" and to reduce gender to some sort of ""men are from mars, women are from venus"" stereotype seems insulting to me as a woman.

I was officially done when a MTF in a sub I frequent basically said cis women aren\'t oppressed, only trans people are and that they hated cis women. Like fuck, the misogyny in that statement is so gross to me. I thought we were supposed to be ""sisters"" and women are supposed to stand up for other women.\n\nI\'m so fucking tired of a shitton of pro-trans content on leftist subs (that\'s almost exclusively aimed at MTFs, never FTMs) and the only discussion of women and feminism is to either shit on liberal feminism or calling individual women they don\'t agree with ugly. And quite frankly, (and I\'m talking mainly about chapotraphouse here) it\'s very concerning to me the amount of vitriol they have for women they disagree with (Meghan McCain, Chelsea and Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris) and how they constantly use gross misogynistic stereotypes to dunk on them rather than their actual opinions, which I also disagree with. While at the same time constantly thirstposting over AOC and not directing nearly the same amount of vitriol towards male politicians. It\'s fucking gross and I\'m tired of this male dominated subreddit acting like women\'s rights are a thing of the past when my own fucking state and several others in the bible belt still actively campaign to restrict access to abortion. Hell, this past midterm election my state made an amendment to the constitution essentially saying ""if Roe v Wade gets overturned, abortion will be illegal here."" But yeah, feminism is over and feminism is just identity politics, women aren\'t oppressed.

This, to me, had started out as a no-brainer. The first time I saw a transexual (as was the term then) in a bathroom, I was young, maybe eight or nine years old. I was washing my hands and I noticed the person next to me had very big hands, like my dad. I looked up and saw what was obviously a man with long hair, make up and wearing a dress. He/she looked down at me and gave a nervous smile, clearly afraid of frightening me. I couldn’t have cared less, gave them a big smile back and went about my day. What’s the big deal? Then I spoke to women who had been victims of serious abuse at the hands of men, some by family members, some by partners, and who didn’t feel remotely safe in close proximity to any man they didn’t know well enough to trust. Women with PTSD. Suddenly I understood, but somehow the rest of the internet didn’t seem to. And why? Because transwomen were also scared of male violence, and apparently transwomen are more important than actual women. \n\nA tweet following an editorial on the GRA in The Guardian, in which someone was outraged because “You literally implied that trans women are biologically male, WTF”.

We’d never practice affirmation with an anorexic who tells you they’re fat. It’s baffling that we do this with gender dysphoric children.\n\nThe idea of a male and female brain - this is increasingly common in transgender ideology and many accept it as scientific fact. If you are a transwoman, its because you have a male body but a female brain, and vice versa. If you are a woman with a traditionally male job (lawyer, airline pilot, doctor) its because you have a male brain, and you are therefore a trans person who is either in the closet or unaware.

You only lost because you didn’t train properly.) \n\nThe way women are being pressured and in some cases outright bullied by men who are used to getting their own way into being submissive and accepting.

Everyone in the forums was making a pretty big fuss, thanking the developers and all that. Up until then I\'d thought that ""other"" just referred to intersex people. But now I was seeing terms like \'nonbinary\' and \'agender\' and all that other crap. Like many teenage girls I had plenty of internalized misogyny and finding out that, despite have an unambiguously female body, I had the option to not be a girl anymore was quite exciting. So I found a video on someone talking about it and one of the first things she says is ""I\'m not a girl or a boy, I\'m just a person"". Half of me thought \'yep that\'s me\' the other half thought \'hang on isn\'t everybody just a person\'. Second half won over, thankfully.\n\nI was still a ""there\'s only 2 genders, transition from one to the other is still fine"" kinda person until I found a Magdelan Berns video where she explained the difference between sex and gender. I rejected it at first because I was too used to using them interchangeably but it soon clicked and I understood what she was talking about. I eventually found this subreddit and finally realized this was what I was looking for and needed. It was how i\'d really thought about the whole gender and sex thing all along before I even knew to separate them or could put it into words. I want everyone to be free from gender, not just myself. Helped me actually get over my misogyny instead of just covering it up with a new label. And I even somewhat understand not feeling right about your own body. I don\'t think I\'ll ever get over the idea that I\'d prefer to have a male body, for social and physical reasons. But taking drugs, getting surgery and demanding everyone change their language around me, really doesn\'t seem like a better option than just learning to get on with my life in which there\'ll always be plenty of stuff to not like about myself or my circumstances gender/sex related or not. I\'m just finally choosing to focus on the things I can actually fix and achieve instead.', 'Reading posts from fetishising men on actuallesbians about how they wish they were lesbians, how ""interesting"" the sex we have seems, trying to get lesbians to divulge our sex lives (no doubt for his own personal enjoyment) and everyone rushing to tell him he\'s probably a transwoman rather than just telling him he\'s a typical fetishising male.', ""I am not quite sure what the term means but i think i get the gist.\n\nI used to write fanfiction. Not the usual smut, in case youre wondering. The stereotypes are very often true though. Anyway, after several years of sampling the writings you get to be able to tell a few things. This sounds like my type of fic, this is definitely going to ship all the male characters, etc. And, most of them are written by women but there is a difference when man writes one. It is hard to describe. Wording, tone, focus etc. I found this hrough reading profile bios of stories i read. They will usually state male or female.\n\nI found a rare well written and thought out fic. I mentally ticked the 'written by a woman' box. I glanced at the bio... A trans man. Huh. I mean, the men vs women writing obviously is no absolute but... You write like a woman. From here you look just like a woman. Made me wonder what exactly was it about them that made them think they were not female? If this trait screams 'woman', i bet that is not the only thing about you. So what makes this person a man who is both biologically female and so clearly has feminine traits? What is it even supposed to mean to feel like a man or a woman? I have no idea what being a woman feels like. If i feel a particular way it is by definition feeling like a woman because i am one.\n\nSo yeah. I tagged a person as their 'assigned at birth' gender by reading their writing style, found out later this person is a 'man'.\n\nI also got mad when hearing the argument that others calling a trans person by 'preferred' pronouns is the 'least' they can do.\n\nYou mean literally shelve everything they think or believe? That is really the least? It is literally an imposition of your opinion on others. The same people hate when religious people do the same thing. 'Well let's all say grace anyway and you must go to church every sunday to be friends with me because my religion is important to me and you respecting it requires no less than your full participation'.\n\nNah that doesn't fly does it?

I even considered if they could be right in 2017. Should I cut my hair? Should I bind my chest? Those were questions I actually considered. \nI\'m so glad I didn\'t but after realizing how toxic and wrong their behavior was, I just couldn\'t support that movement anymore. I\'m also glad that I realized I could love dinosaurs, comics and still be a woman with long hair and way too many dresses', 'Hi everyone! I\'m very new here, so if this is long and ranty I apologize - I\'m just really relieved to see loads of people (women!!!) who can think for themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember when I was a little girl, I strongly identified with Buttercup from the Powerpuff Girls - loved the idea being a tough girl! Being any kind of girl was really cool to me, but I quickly realized that girls couldn\'t do the same things as boys. Wouldn\'t it be easier to live life as a boy, where you aren\'t dismissed for simply being who you are? I got over this train of thought and continued doing my own thing, but recently these feelings sprung back up again and I decided to analyze them. I realized that me thinking I could somehow, possibly be genderfluid (or a boy!!?) was my natural retaliation against gender stereotypes and how honestly unfair it can be to traverse life as a woman. Not as someone who identifies as being a woman, someone who simply *is* a woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing in online LGBT communities meant a lot of trans ideologies shoved down everyone\'s throats - and it wasn\'t until I described it in my head as such that I had to stop for a moment. There was something very wrong about the trans movement, and I feel like a lot of people don\'t even pay attention to it? How trans women are favored over trans men, how any signs of gender nonconformity = trans, trans women speaking up over ""cis"" women. How kids who, like me, think they\'re a boy for awhile are suddenly undergoing life-changing, damaging operations with no pause for thought, how sex-based oppression is completely dismissed, how women\'s issues related to their biologies aren\'t even considered *real*. I learn a lot about the difference between men and womens\' bodies; for example, male and female bodies respond so differently to pain, which is why we (women) are so clinically and medically under-addressed. So yeah, I\'m gonna be angry when trans women make viral tweets about how biological sex isn\'t real, but somehow gender is!! It felt so backwards to me that I couldn\'t stand being online anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo clarify, I\'m not advocating for harm to trans people. Dysphoria\'s real, and the state of the trans movement means that dysphoric people, GNC individuals, young confused LGB kids, and others just struggling with depression and anxiety are completely shafted and sifted into the same category - trans! There\'s a lot of evidence that gender therapy and treatments are so much more effective than going gung-ho on surgeries (that can end up being little more than mutilation, esp in FTM procedures (which is quite telling to me :( )). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I hit PT when I saw something about how ""cis"" women are privileged over trans women. *How* can women possibly be both privileged AND oppressed for our anatomies? How are our biological realities being dismissed as pseudoscience? I\'m glad I got myself out of thinking I need to over-perform for the trans movement. I\'ve found a lot of radfem content in the past month, a lot of which I agree with. It\'s funny, because for the longest time I was convinced by others that I wouldn\'t find anything redeeming in scummy radfems. I know that\'s not the truth now, and I\'m so glad to be able to think for myself in a space shared by other women, for women. It\'s just comforting.', 'I’ve peaked again folks! This time I was at Disney’s Epcot with my fiance. We’re just casually strolling around and I notice an obvious TiM, lots of body and facial hair but they were wearing a black sundress, twirling  a trans flag umbrella around like they’re Mary fuckin Popins. Whatever, not really appropriate since there’s little kids running amuck and other  people trying to walk on the already crowded walkways, I roll my eyes and keep on. We’re in the Japan area and I see the same person. There was a traditional drum line performance and this time, person is swinging that shit in front of everybody like it’s a sword or whatever. Again totally inappropriate and disrespectful to the performers. We go in the gift shop where they have all kinds of imported stuff, everything from candy to kimonos to pop culture stuff and about 5 minutes later in comes the SAME PERSON and their male companion. This idiot has the audacity to start squeaking and giggling and saying “kawaii” in a pretty loud voice at everything they see (Kawaii is a term used in Japanese pop culture to refer to the quality of being cute). Mind you, many of the employees of the shop and people browsing were of Asian descent so I can’t imagine how uncomfortable they must have felt. Personally, it felt like they were trying to be as obnoxious as possible and wanted to draw attention to themselves. We left the park not that long after so I didn’t see them again. \n\nHonestly, I don’t understand how some trans people act like they’re oppressed or invisible or bullied or whatever bs they feel that day, when they’re literally in public acting foolish AND disrespecting others!!', 'I need to talk about the hand thing. You all probably know what I mean but in case you don\'t, here\'s the story that brought it to mind.\n\nToday I saw a person in a dress who was very far away from me.

Don\'t be like that.* After all, all of this is for naught if we\'re still limiting what women can look like. I love Brienne of Tarth. Tall women are good af.

And then do your hands flail about your waist and chest like someone poured ice into your clothes? Do your biceps massage against your chest like you\'re trying to reset your underwire?\n\nAnd then all the other little things snapped into place as I got closer. Pink dyed hair with inches of brown root, a children\'s handbag covered in badges and ribbons, black dress on a hot day, boom boom boom, as Betty Hutton says, ""it\'s a man!""\n\nI mean, damn. What the hell is that? I literally never see anyone do that flippy hand shit unless they\'re a cartoon or a TIM. It\'s insulting just to watch. You really think we look like that? Really?', 'I’ve been lurking here for probably a week now, made a side account for obvious safety reasons. Sad that we have to resort to making new or throw away accounts just to speak up. I don’t remember what day I reached peak trans but I know it happened because of one situation that I witnesses that made me go “enough!” as well as accidentally discovering a Tumblr post about women’s reproductive rights are making almost no progress while the trans movement continues to rise at alarming rates. I am a former genderist who identified as genderfluid for about four years, no thanks to Tumblr’s influence. I also was friends with a TiM for a while, our friendship began prior to his coming out. At first I was supportive of his work with hrt and even having the surgical sex change. But unlike the glamor that Tumblr makes the whole ordeal out to be it was exhausting! Every moment he needed validation for everything about his new looks, his pitched voice, and his cringe worthy feminine mannerisms that he was trying out. Everything was ok so long as he was in a decent mood. But I began to dread spending time with him in person, especially in a public place, in the fear that someone would misgender him. Heaven forbid a waiter would call him “sir” because he would adamantly correct them and then either speak to me or post on social media how he was ready to punch the next person that called him sir. I started to feel anxious all the time that he would get worse with his reactions. \n\nThe moment when I hit peak trans was when an obviously new waiter has called him sir and after being “corrected” he nervously fumbled trying to finish his job in speaking with us and said “sir” again (imagine the It’s Ma’am video). My friend decided this was a good time to order the waiter to say “ma’am” immediately. I felt so horrifyingly embarrassed that I just wanted to go home and never be seen around him and his delusional antics. I remembered at that moment that secondary sex traits exist and that is what strangers use to cue which sex we are. There was no need to be that hostile towards someone who makes less than minimum wage and is just doing their job. And for what? Validation over a plastic surgery image all because he wishes he was a woman? \n\nI would later find out that I now share a lot of views with terfs and I am more than ok with this. It took me longer time to get rid of my genderfluid identity because nobody is allowed to be gender non-conforming anymore. Everyone on the internet tells you that if you do not adhere to a stereotype you must be some sort of trans or other identity. But once I did let go of that old, temporary, identity I felt so much relief! I stopped thinking every moment how I want other people to see me and I just let myself simply exist and live my life. I’ve told myself that I am a woman not because I identify as one, I am a woman because this is my biological reality.', 'This topic is so active and full of comments and I can clearly see why. I want to share my peak trans moment too. I\'m not a native speaker but I do my best. This wasn\'t the first time I questioned the transgender ideology but definitely the moment I thought this is just enough.\n\nSo I regularly visit this women\'s only space (which, by the way, isn\'t for women only anymore, but for anyone who claims to be a woman). It\'s supposed to be a safe space for women who need support in life and for example suffer from low self esteem and mental illnesses (but also for women who don\'t).\n\nIt\'s hard for me, and it has always been hard, to trust men. So that\'s why I have been thinking for years that I will have a baby on my own. Artificial fertilization is one way, and adoption is the second; so a few years ago I thought I want to adopt a baby girl from Asia. I say girl because basically all kids adopted from Asia are girls, you know why. In the women\'s place I also talked about this dream and said I might adopt a girl and maybe move abroad with her.\n\nOthers supported me with my dream, but one visitor suddenly said: ""How do you know it\'s a girl?"" I explained that mostly the kids are girls because women\'s rights are not so good in some Asian countries like China or India. I knew what she meant from the beginning but I pretended I didn\'t understand. The conversation went on and I was speaking about my plans, but she interrupted and said, while I was speaking: ""How can you define one\'s gender before they can define theirs themselves? Are you more interested in the kids genitals than their personality?""\n\nSo this was too much. I wasn\'t ready for such an attack so I went out of words, which I regret now. Everybody else in the room were silent, too - no one knew what to say. And I think no one dared to say anything because this woman was known as a mean person in general and in many other topics, too.\n\nIn my opinion it\'s absolutely rude to say something to someone who is dreaming of a baby. Such dreams are really personal and delicate. But she was obviously just thinking of herself.', 'At the woman\'s march a trans ""woman"" i knew made a facebook post about how a woman holding the sign ""if you dont have a uterus you dont get to tell me how to use it"" was ""problematic."" .....How though? Lol They aren\'t ""cis"" women haven\'t lived the experiences of ""cis"" women and don\'t face the oppression of ""cis"" women. Why cant they be ""trans"" or whatever and understand that it clearly comes with a very separate experience and identity that we could not relate to? Just like they cant relate to us? I would have and easily did call them transwomen with the only sensible expectation Chimimanda Adiche had that there are two separate sets of identities and lived experiences here. ', '[deleted]', 'I\'ve just peaked again.\n\nSo first it was that Tara Wolf character, that\'s what brought me to this sub originally under another account. I remember reading about it in mainstream media and wondering why would a young woman would be so aggressive toward an older feminist woman, even if they strongly disagree about trans stuff? And why did these ""older feminists"" (as it was portrayed) disagree with trans stuff anyway? It just seemed so strange, what the hell was this rift between women? But then I realised something. If you take the story as a young man attacking a woman for having a view he doesn\'t like, it makes perfect sense, because that is the kind of behaviour we get from a lot of aggressive young men. Don\'t get me wrong, I know women can be violent but it\'s not usually done to censor other women as far as I know, that\'s a man thing.\n\nAnd then there was the man who competed in the women\'s cycling and thought it was great that he won? What?!\n\nAnd now the latest - I just read about a man who wants to force women to wax his balls for him. A man who also seems quite willing to ""help"" ten year olds insert tampons. A man who still uses his male name, I might add, as well as not having had his male genitalia removed. Women are not allowed to speak up against this. \n\nAside from the fact that the law is already an ass regarding sexual predators, men now have the option to claim they\'re a woman, and you\'re not allowed to complain or stand against their advances or whatever they want. This is terrifying. I am only sorry I didn\'t know of this sooner. \n', 'Me and my friend, let\'s call her Stacy, are mutual friends with a TIM (let\'s call him Bill). Bill has been a TIM for the last 3-4 years. I\'ve never really had a problem with him, but admittedly not as close to him as Stacy is. That said, every time I have met him he\'s been nice enough and not some crazy REEEEing sexist moron, so I respect calling him she/her pronouns even though he doesn\'t remotely pass.\n\nAnyway, me and Stacy haven\'t seen each other in a while so we decide to meet up. Bill is invited too. I don\'t really care, cause again, he has never been crazy. However, this time he was annoying as shit. He wouldn\'t stfu about himself. Every topic we brought up, he some how found a way to make it about himself and make it about trans rights. Obviously annoyed Stacy politely said ""Hey hey, we haven\'t seen each other in a long time, let\'s leave heavy topics at the door and catch up?"" This causes Bill to get butthurt and say ""well I\'m sooo glad my mental  well being and everyday life if just considered a ""heavy topic"" by you. Cis girls have no idea how hard it is.""\n\nMy knee jerk reaction is to tell this idiot off, but I refrain and try to keep things calm. I say ""That\'s not what she is saying, and you know that. You\'ve been friends with her for years. You know she cares. We just want to have a nice dinner catching up with friends. We all have problems but for one night it would be nice to just temporarily put our problems on hold and have fun.""\n\nThis seems to work and Bill calms the hell down, the rest of the dinner is nice. However later that night I log in facebook and see that this idiot has made a long post about how his ""cisters"" are privileged and don\'t know how much pain we cause him, he also tells the story of how our dinner went, completely exaggerating it and downplaying the part where he was being a rude jackass. \n\nI thought about calling him out, but I noticed someone already had. Two women I know, who happened to be really die hard TRAs, politely pointed out that he was the one that sounded rude by bringing up those topics at a dinner date with friends he hadn\'t seen in a while. A mini slapfight ensues and eventually Bill deletes the post.\n\nStacy later messages me upset. She eventually says that she\'s sick of Bill and sick of TIMs attitudes in general. She apologizes and says that she doesn\'t want to sound like a TERF.\n\nWhile it saddens me that she\'s apologizing even though she did nothing wrong, it also gives me hope that women are waking up.

Let’s say transgender athletes pour into women’s sport, and let’s say, despite the flimsy and poorly-understood relationship between testosterone and elite performance, they dominate everything they touch. They sweep up Grand Slam tennis titles and cycling world championships. They monopolise the Olympics. They fill our football and cricket and netball teams. Why would that be bad? Really? Imagine the power of a trans child or teenager seeing a trans athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium. In a way, it would be inspiring.\n\noh my god. OH MY GOD. You actually need someone to tell you why it would be bad, fuckwit? You need someone to explain to you *who it would be bad for?*\nIt hasn\'t occurred to you that there is another group, a very large group, who would never again get to see their representatives on the top step of the Olympic podium? That other people need to have the opportunity to compete, to win and to be inspired by sporting heroes who represent them *just as much as trans people do* and that taking that opportunity away from 50% of the population to give it to 0.5% of the population is unconscionable?\n\nOh, have you understood what group I\'m talking about now? Maybe mentioning ""50% of the population"" finally clued  you in, or perhaps you\'re still scratching your head going ""I have no idea what he means, what harm does it do just to give trans people a few medals?"" \n\nI\'ll give you another clue, fuckwit. Fill in this blank: Why can\'t _____ just be nice about it?\n\nThere you are. That\'s what you were overlooking. You misogynistic arsehole. ', 'My ex.\n\nEvery single idea of being a girl (and it was always ""girl"", never the mid 30\'s woman he would have been transitioning into) was based on rigid stereotypes. Ending written communications with flowery things such ""lol girlrock :XD"" or ""later lovelies!"" with excessive emojis. A sudden inability to wear pants. Craving chocolate whereas before, he rarely ate chocolate.\n\nOn the second day of HRT, he texted me saying he ""felt the biological urge to eat ice cream and watch chick flicks.""\n\nIt was like his entire personality flipped when he decided he was a girl. Before, he was outgoing, outspoken, confident in presentation. But while in ""girl-mode"", he was suddenly mousey, spoke in barely above a whisper, mincing delicately about, hiding his face behind his hair.\n\nHe became this tsundere anime character. The kind that stutters and goes ""I-i-i think I l-like y-y-you"" - which not so coincidentally, had been the kinds of characters that he, when he presented as male, always fell madly in love with.\n\nHe wasn\'t becoming a woman. He was cosplaying the kind of women he was ATTRACTED to.\n\nThings that we had argued about previously were suddenly subsumed in his ""true self."" For years, he would tell me that I shouldn\'t wear makeup. Once he got upset because I didn\'t ask him beforehand when I dyed my hair. He threw a three day sulk-fit because I got a tattoo he didn\'t want. These were real fights that would last for days.\n\nAnd when he transitioned, he texted me, grandstanding that he had ""finally figured it out"" - he was just jealous of my makeup, my hair, my tats! And he felt ""so much better"" now that he had accepted these things about himself.\n\nBut he never apologized for how he treated me about it. Not once. It made me realize that he hadn\'t actually changed his mind about these things, he had just changed his mind about what it meant to HIM.\n\nAt one point, while trying to support him, he said that ""asking questions"" helped, so I would ask questions. But he\'d get mopey and withdrawn, saying they were ""the wrong questions"". When I asked, he would never tell me what sorts of questions were the ""right ones.""\n\nHe was playing a character and I was ruining the stage-play by not magically knowing the invisible script.\n\nI think the peak trans for me was when he texted me ""I want to eat at Panera! I\'m such a girl!"" (Panera is a salad and sandwich shop.) He. Hates. Panera. In the five years we were together, no matter how many times I asked, he would refuse to eat there, saying there wasn\'t ""even one thing"" on the menu he would eat.\n\nBut because girls love salads, suddenly he wanted to eat there. Suddenly eating salads validated him as a woman. It was beyond ridiculous.\n\nAfter that, I was so done. I cut off contact and haven\'t spoken to him in years.\n\nI found out through a mutual aqqauintance that the fetization of women\'s clothing was very present. He would message her and write long screeds about what he wished she would do to him (sexually) while he was in a skirt. While he was with me, he\'d occasionally want to play the dumb bimbo in a skirt (which I never liked, I don\'t want to humiliate a woman), but with her, it became graphic, extreme, and as she put it ""creepy."" Like he was just using his ""transness"" as a way to include her into his jerk-off sessions.\n\nMy biggest anger about all this is that I do believe that most transgender folks are genuine and earnest. I have seen several of them become happier, more accepting of themselves, and improve their relationships while transitioning. But he was such a jerk and I had to work through my resentment about HIM to even contemplate real trans issues.\n\nIt was a real blow to find out that maybe these ""TERFS"" weren\'t lying about every single trans person. Maybe, for at least some, they were right on target. Even my friends lamented that it was a shame that somehow, I managed to wind up dating the exact kind of person that TERFS were right about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;', '[deleted]', 'I’m new to Reddit, so bare with me. Like many on here there have been multiple of occasions that I have reached “peak”. But this one sticks out to me. Im pretty vocal on another site where many radfems come together (will keep it discreet but it isnt tumblr). Anyway, it also happens to have a large presence of FTM. And they are nasty. They comment on radfem posts with things like “suck my boy clit”,  “terfs should be gassed” (under a post mentioning Hitler) and other things usually MRAs or incels say. Their target is exclusively females. But one of the grossest things by far is when I was going through a profile and found a post about radfems who had mistakened them as trans women and called them “violent males”. And the trans men in the comments on there talked about how they loved it. They loved being called “violent men, mras, rapist men” and other negative aspects of males all because it validated their identity. They also made fun of the radfems of course and basked in the triumph that they deceived a radfem into “correctly” gendering them. It made me sick. I dont believe all trans men have internalized misogyny, but this group definitely does. And the fact they would rather be seen as a violent male that hurts people proves that.

It bothered me because I felt like we were trying to silence 99.9% of women for 0.01% of “women”. I felt like liberal “feminist” women were always the first to jump to transwomen’s defence, but they would not extend us the same courtesy. But I sorta moved on, because Trump was gonna destroy the world, and that seemed more pressing than a few people being offended about period talks. People have been offended by period talks since the beginning of time, nothing new there unfortunately, so I just kept on keeping.\n\nFlashforward a few months to April/May 2017 and my first stumbling upon the Cotton Ceiling theory. I don’t even remember how I first came upon it, maybe when I started wondering if I am actually a lesbian, but I know I was disgusted at what is essentially rape rhetoric being parroted as the ultimate form of feminism. So I tried to see if anyone else felt this way and found that most of  the women genderists call “TERF” really are just lesbians who say they are not wired to be attracted to male bodies, whether they call themselves women or not. As I mostly used social media at the time (namely tumblr and twitter) to read fanfics and retweet gifs, I had never seen that term in one of those “TERF need to die” posts. Instead, I had only seen it once before, in the tumblr description of a mutual, something like “let me know if I have reblogged from a piece of shit like a TERF or a nazi” and had not wondered about it.\n\nLearning about the term “TERF” made me realize that trans activism had become in part synonymous with conversion therapy… which was insane to me. It is LGBT, why is the T trying to undermine the LG? I felt so sick. Not just at them, but also at myself, because I was starting to doubt the narrative. I was starting to doubt that transwomen really are the most oppressed people on the planet. I was becoming a transphobe, and that was basically the same as being a homophobe, right? I was so confused and hurt. That thankfully only lasted for a couple of days, because I was 25 at the time, and not an impressionable kid anymore. Once I realized that trans rights as required by the modern transactivism movement were completely antithetical to the gay rights movement, everything started falling into place. And I saw that word, ""TERF,"" for what it is, a silencing tactic only years of male socialization can produce. In short, “TERF” is the new “women need to stay in the kitchen,” only worse, because males made it “woke” to silence us under the guise of “y\'all transphobes if you won’t let my female dick fuck your lesbian pussy, and deserve to be raped to death.”\n\nSo I started looking into what these women had to say about the rest of the trans movement. Was it just about lesbian rights? Of course it wasn’t, and the problem of letting transwomen into female spaces also took a whole new dimension to me when I saw just how many trans women/men pretending to be trans had attacked women in previously female only spaces. I suddenly found myself wishing for more of the Bathroom Bills… and that is when I realized if anyone knew this, in their eyes I would have become “a piece of shit like a TERF or a nazi.” And I fucking KNEW then that there was no coming back from that. Wanting to be free from penises when I go take a piss or change into my swimsuit doesn’t make me a genocide supporter.\n\nSo, I did what I do best and read up as many things as I could on the topic, and the more I did, the more I realized that so many of the things I had a problem with in “liberal feminism” were problems caused by the corruption of feminism by males. I was anti-porn, anti-prostitution, anti-stripping and anti-kink long before hitting peak trans, but I was often told that that was not a good way to be a feminist, that \\~empowerement\\~ is everything and I was just stuck in the past. Stuck in the past my ass. The people telling me that were just sucking it up to the patriarchy, and that was exactly what they were doing by trying to include “transwomen” into everything. I also realized that the numerous logical fallacies in gender theory had always bothered me, even back when I was a seemingly transfriendly woman. How is gender both a social construct and a feeling? How is non-binary a legit gender identity if you claim gender is a spectrum? If genitals do not a woman make, then why do transwomen cut off their dicks and get a hole to try and imitate a vagina? Etc. I never understood this sort of things, but never tried to question it too hard as an “ex lib fem” because I wanted to be a good ally.\n\nIt’s been a little over two years since my first, small peak trans, and almost two years since the big one, but I know now that deep down I was always gender critical. Me hitting peak trans was only a matter of time. Trans activism tries to drown the voices in women’s heads that try to tell us that transwomen are not women by shaming us and making us feel guilty. But no amount of female socialization will ever be stronger than our natural instincts and our intelligence. One day, all women will listen to that voice and hit peak trans, and I think the transwomen in sports debate is soon going to take us there.

I never felt connected to liberal ideology, always felt very estranged from it, which was a source of inner conflict because I knew that as a SSA woman I was supposed to be liberal by default, especially since I staunchly rejected my Christian upbringing, and back then I thought people were either liberal or conservative, wherein the latter was bad and the former was supposed to be good. (Luckily, this political disorientation led me to discovering the resource-based socioeconomic model, which really resonated with me and still does.) But ""feminism"" by modern interpretations always felt empty and vaguely counter-intuitive. I was always uncomfortable with sex pozzy culture and porn culture and hookup culture, and even though I ID\'d as trans for a couple years in my 20s, that was well before the cult developed into what it is now. No one denied biological sex back then. ""Terf"" didn\'t exist. We really were just trying to quietly live our lives and present ourselves in a way that made us feel comfortable (though of course, it never worked, because it was all performance and insecurity and denial and hiding). Even after I no longer went by my ""male name,"" I was privately ""nonbinary"" and ""genderfluid"" for years, y\'know, because I was just too damn special and unique to be an ordinary WOMAN, god forbid (even though I was the one on pro-trans threads pointing out that hey, we shouldn\'t call it ""boy\'s toys"" or ""girl\'s clothes"" because those things have no gender).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy peak libfem started developing around the time the \\~hijab positivity\\~ trend (for lack of a better term) began surfacing on social media, and as a passionate anti-theist, my first thought was, how can you fucking idiots possibly think this practice or religion could ever be labeled ""feminist""? So it started there... but even then, I was still supporting ""trans rights"" (whatever that meant) and celebrated Bruce Jenner\'s transition bullshit, but shortly after, it all went to hell. I started reading about what a sexist dick he actually was, and when I finally saw my first ""lesbians are bigots for not wanting dick"" post on Tumblr, that was it for me. Never looked back.

One local woman started a meetup last year, but we only had one meeting (my wife and I were the only other ones who showed up), and I thought it was really cool, but she\'s never organized anything since.

They were using the word “queer” quite happily, and I was shocked, as when I grew up that was considered an absolutely unacceptable insult. The “reclaiming” of that word came out of nowhere; I felt suddenly out of touch, and having considered myself a feminist I felt I should be paying more attention and trying harder. They talked about intersectionality, which I had to look up (I know, naive white feminist alert - I was young) and about how selling your body for sex was no different to selling your services as an accountant/bricklayer/consultant/whatever. I felt like I had so much to learn and so many prejudices to unlearn. I vowed to do better.\n\nOne video included an apology. In a previous video, they had said something about women and period poverty. Several people had commented to complain about this, and the YouTuber now apologised for their “clumsy” choice of words, clarifying that of course not all women have periods (fair enough, I thought, but a strange thing to be offended about) and… that not all people who have periods are women. Well now I was thoroughly confused. I read through the comments and came across the words “trans” and “transgender”. I had read about transexuals and met a few transvestites in my time, but transgender was a new term to me. After a little research I concluded that it was indeed cruel to deliberately call a transwoman a man when you knew they only felt comfortable presenting as a woman. Simple enough, I thought.\n\nFast forward a few years. Transgender was by now a commonly used term, and people were more open and accepting. Grand! Lovely. I felt lucky to live in such a time. But - I had questions. And it seemed very important to me to have these questions satisfactorily answered. I didn’t know any trans people personally, but I was conscious that this didn’t mean it had nothing to do with me. What if my future child comes to me and tells me they are trans? How can I best help and support them if I’m ignorant or confused about what that actually means? I was afraid of asking these questions outright on the internet in case I worded things wrong and upset someone (oh hai there, female socialisation) but I reckoned someone must’ve asked the same questions somewhere, so I went looking for the answers on Twitter and various online forums.\n\nSome of my questions were as follows… I have never found satisfactory answers\n\n\\- If sex and gender are not the same thing and have nothing to do with each other, why the need for medical transition to resemble the opposite sex? And why do we have transwomen saying things like “I am a woman therefore my body is female, therefore penises are not male”?\n\n\\- I read that the state of New York officially recognises 32 separate genders. What are they, and how are they defined?\n\n\\- What is gender? (most answers to this lead me to conclude that currently gender is viewed as a sort of personality label. How very progressive.)\n\n\\- If transwomen are women, in just the same way that black women are women and tall women are women, then what is a woman? What does it mean to be trans?\n\n\\- I read that most non-European cultures used to be very gender fluid and accepting of different sexualities, and that it was only the European colonialists that imposed heterosexuality and the idea of only two genders and two sexes. I couldn’t find much about this other than indigenous Mexican muxes and a similar equivalent in Native American culture, which people keep pointing to (along with intersex people) as evidence of a “third gender”, which A) doesn’t make sense, and B) third gender? I thought there were dozens? Which is it? Also, transvestites are still a thing, are we just erasing them completely now?\n\nNobody was able to answer these questions. The best you can hope for is circular logic such as “as woman is anyone who feels like a woman”. And if you question it, you’re insulted, blocked, and sometimes doxxed. Which made me think… these were logical questions which came from a place of wanting to understand, wanting to not be ignorant, wanting to be a good ally to the trans community. Why are people with such good intentions are being harassed when they won’t blindly accept the illogical nonsense they’re told? Why aren’t there real answers to these questions? This is when my peak trans moment started. Then it started to snowball…"", 'I think I may have hit peak trans....

All through high school and after I was a staunch supporter of gay rights and took it very seriously. I remember after high school, a little after gay marriage was legalized, that the focus shifted dramatically from supporting same sex attraction to supporting trans people. It was all very new to me and so I started following trans blogs and trying to learn everything I could and show my support to this newfound marginalized community. My first “wtf” moment was when I followed this girl that I thought was super attractive and she came out as a trans man. I would see her on tumblr posting nudes of her very female body and then... her comments... she would get upset that lesbians were hitting on her because she “was a man” and then spew this nonsense that “if you’re attracted to her you’re obviously straight”... It was a VERY confusing time for me because this was when I was coming out of a long depression after being raped and basically trying to perform conversion therapy on myself (I’d watch violent straight porn and try to become aroused and masturbate or frequently flirt with violent men) and thought I was probably gay because all this was making me MISERABLE. So for an obvious woman to tell me that my attraction to her made me straight... was BEYOND confusing at the time. But I still followed enough lesbian blogs and some would speak on their experiences that sounded so similar to mine and it sparked something after a while (that I would still try to suppress later on by sleeping with a guy the day I met my wife, that internalized homophobia y’all). Scrolling through tumblr one day I came across a post by a popular bisexual blogger who said that “it’s problematic to only be attracted to one set of genitals.” Now... I had really had it at that point because I was still trying to hook up with random dudes (thanks sex positive culture) and literally not being able to because I found their dicks disgusting and it was just making my depression worse. So I commented and asked how it was problematic. I got told I was “reducing people to their genitals” and how “sexist” that was and how “it isolates trans people who I should consider sexual partners.” I commented back how that makes no sense, some people don’t like all genitals because that’s how sexuality works and got called a TERF lol I had NO IDEA what that even was btw. I kept seeing it everywhere tho so I looked it up in the tags. Found a ton of radfems blogs that made sense to me. All speaking about biology and the dangers of trans activism and this postmodernist take on sexuality and it was like a veil was lifted and I was OBSESSED. All these women were so kind (well most lol) and just cared about informing people. So yeah... \n\nTLDR: I (a woman) got called straight for being attracted to a woman and then got called a TERF for saying that some people only like one sex. Thanks TRA’s for literally driving me into the arms of TERFS lol', '((long one, sorry))\n\ni don\'t know if i\'ve ever had one defining ""aha!"" moment, but years of living and dealing with my sister slowly led to me doubting not just her, but the entirety of the trans movement itself, until i finally turned to radical feminism.\n\nthe first moment being about four years ago. she\'s been claiming she\'s a man since we graduated high school, and at the time i was swallowing the libfem koolaid so i was gung-ho about being the supportive sister. i\'m a very curious person by nature, and i always want to know everything when introduced to something new, so i asked her a few questions about it. i distinctly remember her saying she was a man because she ""didn\'t enjoy the \'girly\' things."" you know, makeup, dresses, etc. i don\'t remember what all i asked her to get that answer. the only question i for sure remember asking her came right after though: ""how do you know you\'re trans and not just gnc?"" i\'ve never seen anyone shut down the way she did. she got very quiet, wouldn\'t look at me, and after probing for an answer i got something along the lines of ""it\'s just different, i just know, it\'s transphobic for you to keep asking me that."" as soon as we got to our destination everything was all hunky-dory, but i still didn\'t understand why what i\'d asked upset her or why i had to apologize. it became apparent very quickly to me that i wasn\'t allowed to try to understand this, i just had to accept and accommodate accordingly (which is the exact opposite of how i handle things in life).\n\ni feel it a little bit every time she looks for validation, too. i\'m a woman and a lesbian. i don\'t need people confirming this for me constantly in order to be comfortable with my existence. but she goes on and on about how putting up with her period makes her ""manlier"" than actual men or how ""gay"" she is when she swoons over actors/characters, then looks at me expectantly. like i\'m supposed to be all ""omg yaaaasssss you\'re so gay"" or something. there\'s even an animal at her work that is aggressive with males, and because it doesn\'t like her she thinks it\'s the greatest validation she\'s ever had in her life--never mind that this animal could do her some very serious harm (and is also aggressive to other animals, how does she know it isn\'t just smelling the other animals she\'s handled?????).\n\nedit: even when learning about the dangers of binding for long periods of time (and having a moment where she wore her binder out in public for so long she couldn\'t breathe and had a panic attack until i found a bathroom where she could remove it), she still insists that binding is better for her than existing with her breasts and she\'d ""just deal"" with the problems until her top surgery, and i was being super terfy for disagreeing. admittedly, i\'ve stolen both binders she bought and threw them away; she thinks the cats have taken them. maybe that isn\'t the most ethical way of dealing with that specific problem, but i\'m willing to be the bad guy if it means protecting her from actual physical harm.', 'I honestly felt like I was going crazy. Like many of you, I tried hard to be an ally. I wanted to be on what I thought was the right side of history and I tried desperately to drink the cool-aid but every little sip I would take tasted wrong and I couldn\'t put my finger on why. \n\nA lot of the arguments I\'ve found here are things I\'d actually come to on my own. Ie what the hell does it mean to feel female? or the weird idea that social constructs such as gender roles and gender stereotypes dictated a person\'s gender instead of proving that we are more than what social constructs say we are. I would write myself off and tell myself that I just didn\'t understand. That this many people can\'t be wrong. That if I just tried hard enough, eventually it will click... I even came to a point where I was angry at myself for not understanding, I thought I was a transphobe or a terf (despite not really know what a terf was other than it was apparently the equivalent of a nazi) and I didn\'t know how to overcome that.\n\nIt all started to come to a head when characters in fiction that I strongly identified with were being claimed by people as being NB because of gender stereotypes despite only ever using She/Her pronouns and it frustrated me because if these characters I related so strongly to were considered NB or Trans as some people claimed, than so was I.\n\nI\'m a lesbian. I don\'t get a lot of well done representation in media so when I find some and they start getting claimed by NB or trans people, it felt strangely personal. Like my own identity as a lesbian was being erased. I still wanted to be supportive but it frustrated me how any woman that showed traits that were stereotypically male, were suddenly considered not women.\n\nThe cancel culture that\'s so prevalent in social media didn\'t help either. No one speaks up publicly for fear of social suicide, or being labled as a terf. So I felt very alone. Like I was the only one feeling this way and therefor I HAD to be wrong. I HAD to be missing something. I was getting more an more frustrated with myself for not understanding these people even though within the Trans community, they couldn\'t even decide on anything and depending on who was talking, there was a whole other set of rules for what makes one trans.\n\nOn Lesbian day of Visibility I saw numerous posts on twitter cross my path telling people to love, support and lift up all lesbians. trans lesbians, non  binary lesbians, HE/HIM LESBIANS. How??? I don\'t even understand how you can be a lesbian if you don\'t even believe you have a gender, let alone actively referring to yourself as a man! Funnily enough I took more issue with those calling themselves NB than I did Trans because I very much wanted to believe them when they said they were born in the wrong body even though I felt guilty (yeah, guilty) knowing that I would never be able to embrace *""girldick""*. NB seemed more... abstract? At least trans women were calling themselves women so that didn\'t feel as jarring even though it still didn\'t sit right.\n\nI came to a point where I felt so alone in my confusion and anger at myself that I googled and googled the hell out of NB Lesbians to try to understand how you could have no gender/or both and still consider yourself a lesbian and I came across an article that talked about the erasure of lesbians because of gender theory and it started to click... I don\'t think I was fully there yet, but I finally knew I wasn\'t alone.\n\nThen there was a post on reddit in offmychest, I believe, where a woman went off about trans ideology and her situation mirrored mine almost exactly. A lesbian who tried desperately to be an ally and who got more and more frustrated by it all and the contradictions and the mentality of trans ideology that she angrily declared herself a terf. In the comments someone linked to this subreddit... and since then, I\'ve spent HOURS reading post after post after post. Suddenly... I don\'t feel so alone anymore. I realize now that I was being gaslit by the TRA\'s to a point that I was angry with myself for thinking logically and critically of gender theory.\n\nI no longer believe I\'m a transphobe or a terf either. I realize now that the word terf was specifically made to shut down any sort of criticism and silence those who had concerns. I honestly feel... really bad for the trans community. At worse they are fetishists, and at best they are innocents who have gotten caught up in the whirlwind of propaganda that if you have any body dysmorphia or don\'t ""feel"" female or male then you must be trans or NB. There are kids who are taking hormones and mutilating their bodies in order to feel like they belong when the truth is... we were all awkward ass kids who didn\'t know shit about who we were or where we fit in in the world... I hate that I feel like I can\'t even reach out to these individuals to help them see that they\'re being duped into a fucked up social construct for fear of outing myself, losing my job or being targeted. These kids are buying into gender ideology, a social construct... something *literally made up* rather than their biology and I actually fear for them and their futures. There are parents who truly believe they are helping and supporting their children by having their genitals mutilated... and speaking up for them can leave you ostracized, or even have you investigated for ""hate speech."" \n\nI\'m not longer mad at myself, but I\'m deeply sad and worried for the future of this world when we can\'t even have this discussion without being written off as hateful extremists by people who would gladly encourage people to join them in mutilating themselves and leaving themselves infertile or with crippling health problems for the rest of their lives.', 'My peak trans moment was in high school. I went to an ALL GIRLS’ SCHOOL for my high school education and while I was there one of my classmates came out as Trans. She claimed that people were to refer to her using “they/them OR he/him” pronouns. Now I think maybe I would’ve been fine with it had she left after that year, that was not the case.\n\nNot only did this person move up to become a “student leader” and head of our GSA but she also continued at our school until senior year. She even went to admissions and the head of our equity and inclusion to change school policy to let in people who are either not biologically female or who claim their gender is something that falls in between. It’s all girls’ school, has been since the 1800’s, it is a single sex school. I don’t understand why administration would agree with this one single student that they should change their policies to accept people with a different sex.\n\nI think that’s endangerment for the other girls. Imagine being roommates with a “girl” who has a penis, imagine walking into the locker rooms or going out for sports knowing that one of your peers could be a man claiming to be a woman. It’s dangerous, especially for high school girls who already deal with so much sexual harassment and abuse already by the misogynistic media that expects them to be, look and dress sexy by the time they’re 12. \n\nI just don’t understand it. And it still bother me to this day that this supposedly transgender person didn’t even move onto an all boy’s or a co-Ed college, instead she went to another All Girls’ School. Honestly? I think she’s just looking for attention, but I guess to her endangering her fellow students is a small price to pay for individualism.', 'My peak trans moment: \n\nI live in a very tolerant and alternative little town in the UK. A woman ran a ""Red Tent"" group in my town. The membership criterion is very simple: you must be a menstruating woman, or capable of menstruating (ie, you could be on the pill or some other menstruation-suppressing medication, or born female and not bleeding for other reasons). Cue a local TIM who has been crashing women\'s stuff in town demanding to be allowed to come along. He actually claims to have bleeding, which prompted a friend of mine to gently suggest that he needs to see a doctor if that\'s the case. No one actually knows if he\'s had surgery or not... in any case he can\'t menstruate because... male. My lovely kind friend who was genuinely worried that this person had had surgery which had gone wrong.... etc. etc. was then viciously verbally attacked for the crime of suggesting that this man might need medical care. WTF is wrong with these people? I have never experienced this level of delusional narcissism in any other group of people except maybe alt-right incels. So, after the public name-calling of my friend as  a ""transphobe"", the group actually disbanded.  So, another victory for the woman-hating fetishists.', ""Hitting peak trans AGAIN because I don't understand why people going around calling gross old hairy men in wigs and make up goddesses.

I also have been more outspoken about the correlation between legal prostitution and human trafficking and smacking down choice feminism.

I have spent the last two days in a complete fog of grief over the abortion bans and coming end of Roe. I logged on to my social media a few min ago, and it’s all a) people reminding us men can get pregnant too, so tsk tsk let’s not call it a women’s issue and b) calling it a white supremacy issue rather than a women’s issue. \n\nYou know what, I’m on an unfollow fucking roll right now. If your response to women losing autonomy over our bodies is to take away our autonomy over how we refer to ourselves and talk about our lives, then fuck you bye. \n\nYou think this is about whiteness?

Go to India and ask who is buying and selling child prostitutes. Go ask a woman of any color anywhere who is her domestic abuser. SPOILER ALERT: IT’S MEN! Not white men. Men. Black men white men Asian men middle eastern men. Men men men. \n\nYes this bill will hit black women harder. This is what we call intersectionality (surprise! It’s not actually about white men in dresses!). But FFS, WHY CAN WE NOT CALL THIS A WOMENS ISSUE?!!

She had always been very critical of my feminism (not in an illogical antifeminist way, in a completely fair critical thinking way, even if I didn\'t take it that way at the time). After a while, and some time in university during which I feel I was encouraged to learn critical thinking, I decided that if TERFs were really so bad and awful, reading their blogs shouldn\'t convert me. This was around February 2017; I was doing all kinds of stupid things back then like intentionally reading/watching things on the internet to make me angry, and I had a history of arguing with pro-lifers for literally DAYS online, so I thought ""hey, I\'d love a good hate read. I\'ll read a radical feminist blog."" That was it for me. The second I read actual radical feminist analysis, it immediately answered *so many* of the questions I\'d had for so long that liberal/mainstream feminism refused to answer... for so long I had thought I was just too stupid to understand the philosophical complexities of those problems and that if I waited long enough, they would make sense. Holy shit. Nope. I followed some blogs, got more and more into it, and eventually one of my friends had a huge long argument with me (the ""bathroom"" argument) during which he told me some patronizing bullshit about wanting me to be the best I can be and then said this conversation was making him suicidal (despite him not being trans) so we had to stop. He hasn\'t spoken to me since then.\n\nI think I peaked again when I had probably the only real mental breakdown of my life arguing with some idiot ""Ph.D"" on tumblr who claimed that biological sex wasn\'t dimorphic and that I was a stupid idiot who should never have been let into grad school. I realized tumblr was a hellhole and just signed out forever. ', '[deleted]', 'I don\'t know if this counts as ""peak trans"" because I was never really on board with the transgender stuff to begin with. I was angry and horrified at the movement, but my ""peak"" came when reading about those two TIMs in Connecticut who placed first and second in a state track meet. And people were going, with a straight face, like, ""Yup, looks like we\'ve got a new girls\' record here."" And the response of one of the officials was to basically say that girls shouldn\'t care about winning.\n\nI\'m at the point where I can no longer sit by and watch. I want to DO something to fight this. Step one for me is finding communities like this one and making connections with like-minded people.\n\nI\'m not a radfem; in fact I am mostly politically conservative.

Just read in today\'s (1/30/19) Telegraph that 8 members of Iran\'s National Women\'s football team were discovered to be male. Team authorities claimed they were trans women who had yet to transition surgically.

For the last few years, and especially last year, I’ve been blending into the community in support of trans people. I’ve always had a weird feeling about it, but before hey started being aggressive and demanding, I was accepting of their identity. Here’s what got me to come here between then and now:\n\n\n1- “Transbian” takeover of the ActualLesbians sub. God they are EVERYWHERE. I’d bet a good 40% of that sub are just TIMs. And have you noticed they’re almost all ‘lesbians’, not bisexuals? (So just straight men then). \n\n\n2- Uteruses and periods are not female anymore? I saw discussions on twitter about FGM and how women are discriminated against for having periods. Except there are people now trying to change the language to “bleeders” or “people with periods / uteruses”. What?! These issues are stigmatized in the first place because the people with these things are WOMEN. It stems from sexism! They are women’s issues.\n\n\n3- I read some studies about sex and the brain, and how there are only very minute differences between the two. Everyone is a spectrum and has qualities of both. It’s just physical biological differences and socialization that differentiate the sexes - something that no TIM will ever have! So they can’t be women. \n\n\n4- Reading a statistic that 70% of TIM keep their penis is disgusting. Even if the actual statistic is lower - around 50% or something - I trust absolutely no transgender person who isn’t yearning to change their biology to be the sex they want. And now we are forced to like their “girldick” (ew!) or be kicked out of their communities. \n\n\n\nThere’s SO much more, like the disgusting period appropriating thing, but I am so done with the vast majority of trans people. Especially TIMs. \n\n\n\n\n\n', ""Peak Trans again.  When younger, I was friends with a very androgynous man (well many, but one in particular) who eventually went 'non-binary' but is now somewhere between non-binary and 'she'.  I suspect in less than a year's time this person will completely identify as a woman.  This person is 'buying boobs' soon with the primary goal being to perform as a stripper.  As a female stripper of course, because that's for girls!  With boobs!  As you can expect, this is being championed by peers, mostly consisting of sex workers and sex worker advocates, etc.  No females that address this person are asking any questions because the whole scene is laden with sex workers who apparently see nothing wrong with a man well into his 40's waving his naked fake breasts around in a clownish parody of his idealized feminine self.  I'm not a stripper and the idea that a man who calls himself a woman is buying boobs to wave them around still makes me uncomfortable but I'd think if I was involved in what is commonly justified as a celebration of the female form, ad nauseum, I'd consider this a direct parody of how I was existing and not at all feminist or a celebration of women or women's sexuality.  I...I just don't understand."", 'I\'ve been through a lot and yet, my peak trans moment was fairly recent. I kept having gender critical opinions, such as reidentifying as a GNC woman instead of any flavor of ""genderqueer"" but trying to have it both ways, keep all my genderist associations and run a blog. But i was living in fear of being found out. Another blog on tumblr reblogged from me, a declared TERF. I hit block and then looked through their blog finding everything i agreed with and finally considered...why? \n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks that its a huge sign of cult level conditioning that i was so afraid of being harassed or exiled for SOMEONE ELSE I\'D NEVER FOLLOWED REBLOGGING FROM ME. That is absolute bananas. \n\nI unblocked, started reading gender critical stuff with that in mind, and it all came together how my abusive past with two TiMs was the catalyst for this madness. Though i will warn anyone reading in advance the following account is likely to be upsetting to survivors of similar abuse. \n\nMy first TiM partner was originally a gay man who started to have bisexual inclinations for me and then started to come out as openly trans once we reconciled a romantic relationship. Fucking. Bad. Idea. I had just gotten out of a severely emotionally abusive relationship and the pattern was about to continue with probably the most awful of my rebounds. With the added flavor and fun of TiM lunacy though! Buckle up!\n\nI tried to be accepting. I tried to understand. Nothing was ever good enough. I was constantly offending him by not immediately being the perfect, educated transactivist partner. He broke down my resistance with repeated heavy emotional abuse for every perceived aggression that was usually me not understanding or coping. He told me he was so reminded of his ex TiF partner in high school who committed suicide after a rape (i actually don\'t know if this, or many things this TiM told me was true). He started to insist things like how much i was like the TiF ex that it was not a coincidence. That i ""acted more like a little boy than any twink"" he\'d ever known. (In hindsight, really alarming that i was apparently like a ""little boy"" and not a full grown man.) He started to try to suggest i was a TiF. I was deeply uncomfortable but ""saw his point"" i guess. I started feeling very dysphoric, more than usual, so i decided he was right and i was, at the very least, a genderfluid person. Finally, and at long last, i couldn\'t take it anymore. My memory is fuzzy, probably due to trauma and dissociation, but i snapped and, while still considering myself a transactivist who was in an abusive relationship, broke it off and went no contact. Though i still was thoroughly conditioned to be vaguely genderqueer and a transactivist, the next couple of years calmed down. \n\nThat is, until, i got my silly little dumbass into trouble and started hanging in that crowd again. During this time, a person i was in unrequited love with and had not given up on truly came back into my life (that\'s a longer more personal story i don\'t want to get into but it was a thing.) They were in the tumblrsphere but not ""out"" yet. Shortly after we got together and, this man I\'d known since high school, who did have a cross dressing thing with at least mild dysphoria came out to me as a TiM. I was supportive. I told him i would love him no matter what and was willing to try this again. \n\nA dynamic in our relationship had always been that he would abuse and scapegoat me, put me down and make fun of who i was and what i believed. This didn\'t stop. It got worse. And the dynamic of my previous relationship repeated. Just being and living as a woman and talking about it was transphobia and cause for reprisal along with the silent treatment. If i wasn\'t metaphorically or literally sucking his dick he didn\'t care about me except to ""educate"" me. I got more dysphoric. I started feeling like i wanted to be nothing, like a void, so, we decided i was mostly ""agender"" and a they/them. \n\nI started to become very depressed. I acted like i was extremely off the wall in a way i don\'t know if I\'ve ever been. Nothing i ever did was right. Nothing about how i tried mattered. He got more and more distant. I got more clingy and toxic myself.  \n\nHe started saying i was like an incel. He started saying i was a creep. He started suggesting that wanting his attention or empathy was tantamount to severely sexually and emotionally abusing him. He said i was basically every predatory male he\'d ever been abused by basically. \n\nIt escalated into her severely abusing and discarding me to nearly the point of suicide. I had to have friends take me in to prevent that during the great final fallout. \n\nThen he came out more openly in real life and online. And when he did, he tried to take my identity in a way. He started believing things he used to trash about my beliefs. He started talking more like me. He would ""kin"" with fictional characters that looked or acted like me. He started being loudly ""body positive"" regarding specific physical traits i had that he was obviously himself unattracted to and would subtly make an issue out of. It was so bad. I was so angry.\n\nAnd then, he got noticed by a small group of trolls online, justifiably so. And I\'m not proud of this. But i joined the group trolling him and though i would not participate directly i told them all about his abuse and everything embarrassing i could for fuel. I was in so much pain and wanted him to hurt and thought maybe it would stop him abusing others. \n\nThen he retaliated when the group went too far with him. He began to speak about his ""abuser"" who was a violent transphobe, stalking him in real life and online, someone who had sexually abused and raped him and invalidated his identity violently several times. I was doing no such thing in real life. I would AVOID places irl i knew he might be. I avoided entire areas. And i don\'t think i need to tell anyone here that i certainly was NOT raping him. I was a (and still kinda am) socially awkward and sometimes have trouble with boundaries, however I\'d always been corrected about this in relationships and had never been called abusive! That\'s not even mentioning how i was the one pressured into sex all the time on demand and sometimes it would violate my boundaries. He didn\'t say my name but, It was like a threat: Stop talking about how i abused you or I\'ll dox you for real. \n\nSo i swallowed it. Convinced i was the abuser because i felt guilty about the group and what they did to him. I stopped talking. I blamed myself. It muted the gender critical thoughts i was starting to have and i dove full in to trans activism and my genderspecial bullshit, it was almost like this strange repentance. \n\nEven months after i shoved off i guess he resonated with certain hateful people again (other victims?? I\'m piecing it together bc at the time i had a friend keep an eye on him for my sake and i refused to look or be involved) and he started getting attention again,  at this time he doubled down on blaming this horrible transmisogynist stalker and we were scared i was getting doxed soon. So i started bracing for that and taking protective measures, and then suddenly! His last call out he emphasized i only abused him because I\'d been abused and he didn\'t want anyone finding and harassing me so he was not going to name this dreaded abuser. He suddenly deleted all his social media and has been gone since. But the damage was done. \n\nI was still convinced it was mutually abusive. It would take a lot of gradually distancing myself from the movement and going through some life changes to realize otherwise. It was recently, like i said, that i finally decided i wasn\'t at all gender queer and was secretly somewhat gender critical. Its now that I\'m finally embracing what i should have in the first place, all my instincts and questions i had when the trans phenomenon didn\'t add up for me. \n\nI no longer tolerate that kind of abuse and bullshit. Not from anyone and certainly not from the violent TiMs that operate much like a cult these days.', 'I thought I went into the valley, but hit another peak:\n\nA woman I know who has had a lot of serious trauma in her life caught the gendies and is now a ""nonbinary, queer softboi.""

At all. I\'ve always been in favour of trans rights and thought that ""TERF""s were conservatives masquerading as feminists. It\'s been a really quick change. Like within a month. There\'s been a few things that started my journey here. \n\nThe main things were Graham Linehan and Mermaids, and being a lesbian. I originally thought that Glinner was going too far and shouldn\'t have any part in deciding that a charity for trans children (think of the children!) shouldn\'t get money. But it was a post on ONTD, of all places, that helped me change my mind. If it was just counselling and talking to parents, I wouldn\'t care, but puberty blockers... That shouldn\'t just be handed out to kids because they aren\'t acting like they\'re supposed to according to society. There\'s going to be a generation of children with problems from that. As someone who grew up feeling sure I was supposed to be a boy and my parents made me have surgery to become a girl because I liked both traditionally masculine and feminine things, I secretly liked girls, I didn\'t understand my own anatomy, and I\'ve never felt like I fit the stereotypical ""female"" role however hard I tried. I thought I was genderfluid for a few months about 5 years ago. But it turns out that nobody fits the stereotypes perfectly, and once I accepted I was a lesbian I felt a lot more comfortable in myself. If I were to say that now, I would be on puberty blockers and told that I\'m transgender or gender nonconforming, when I just needed time and a society that wasn\'t pushing me to be something I wasn\'t. \n\nBut now I accept that I\'m a lesbian, it\'s been difficult in a different way. I am completely repulsed by any kind of penis. I\'m honestly kind of asexual? even when it comes to women, but penises are not at all something I want to be near or look at or touch. But I\'d go along like ""well, they\'re still women, so it\'s all fine maybe some people are okay with that"". And I honestly just have got really fed up of being told that not wanting to have sex with a penis, even a ""feminine penis"", is terrible and I\'m a massive TERF and I\'m just obsessed with genitalia. A penis is inherently male. Stop saying it\'s not. Stop telling me that I\'m wrong for being a raging dyke and stop pretending to be a lesbian when you\'re clearly bi. \n\nSome other things that brought me here: a different ONTD post which had comments talking about trans women in sports and how unfair that is, and how basic facts and safety were being ignored to seem ""inclusive"". Thinking if gender is supposed to be a spectrum, why do trans people seem to go to extremes? I\'ve seen very few androgynous trans women, but plenty that are extremely feminine, saying that wearing high heels and long hair and nail polish is important to their womanhood. So then women who don\'t do those things aren\'t women? I get a certain amount is wanting to pass, but I just don\'t get the rest. The middle of the spectrum just looks like women with short hair and bowties or men with short hair and makeup, maybe a skirt. You can do those things regardless of gender though? Also my little sister becoming involved in trans things. I don\'t understand it. She was a very feminine toddler, became a bit more of a tomboy during childhood and early teens, and now she\'s cut her hair off and has transgender flags everywhere. She has never (outwardly) shown any signs of being trans. She has always seemed comfortable in her body. But I don\'t understand why she thinks that she\'s not a woman. She is very similar to me in a lot of ways, also to our mum who also does/likes stuff regardless of whether it\'s ""masculine"" or ""feminine"". I honestly don\'t mind that she cut her hair off (even if I thought it was very pretty long, and she keeps wanting to cut it shorter which doesn\'t suit her face), I don\'t mind that she dresses in traditionally masculine clothes (I only wish she got better at dressing her body type - everything is so baggy and long). Genuinely. I just don\'t think she\'s transgender. I think she\'s an insecure teen who doesn\'t feel like a stereotypical woman and has adopted this new identity to explain why. But I can\'t tell her that because if I even mention something about how men suck or whatever around her then she\'ll start sulking. I don\'t know. I just hope that she grows up to be comfortable with herself.\n\nSorry that this was really long. It\'s been building up for a while and just exploded. I\'m still not entirely sure what I believe, and I\'m still getting used to being this side of the fence, but it feels like it makes a lot more sense and is way more easily proven. Now I\'ve just got to hide this from the rest of the leftist places I hang out in.\n\neta: I also got annoyed when trans women got annoyed at women for talking about having vaginas or periods, etc., or things like the pussy hats.

Another, who I don\'t actually *know*, is an individual I see around my town with some regularity. Every time I see him I feel terrified and leave the area quickly, if possible, because if he sees me, he gets this sick glint in his eye and makes a beeline for me. I have been literally chased around in a public area, forced to *sprint* away to safety, because he was following me less than a foot away and whispering weird shit in my ear.\n\nThe third one, the knowledge of whom I had apparently been repressing, somehow manages to be the most horrific of the three. When I was 18, I worked at a local bar/restaurant. I always worked the shift that had an open mic night. Most people who came were fairly benign. But one man left a permanent fucking scar on my psyche, and probably the psyches of other young women working there... He was 50ish and would come in wearing weird shit, filthy shawls and terribly applied makeup. His ""music"" was sometimes just a little off color, and very discordant. But many of his songs were literally too awful to describe. Seriously, just the worst shit humanity has to offer. What I can remember contained graphic references to pedophilia, violent antisemitism, and misogyny. He was allowed to carry on for *months* and was, to my knowledge, never asked to leave- a testament to the shittiness of that workplace. He would also constantly approach me when I was working, repeatedly asking me to ""be his girlfriend"". At the time, I was still brainwashed and felt I had to be kind to him.\n\nAnd it gets worse, somehow! One day, a coworker informed me that they had found this man\'s personal facebook. And oh boy, was it BAD. I seriously wish I had never searched it up... Among the bizarre, paranoid posts about how the CIA was trying to kill him, and photos of some random woman he photoshopped himself into, calling her his ""Chinese wife"", were posts about *me.* Me, and several other women I worked with. He would write explicit masturbation and rape fantasies about his, calling us by name. There were also a ton of sexualized photos of little girls. The restaurant would not ban him, and I would have to look this sick motherfucker in the face every time he came in. He wasn\'t even a paying customer!!!\n\nI sincerely was so much happier before about an hour ago when I remembered all of this. I really wish I hadn\'t made the rash decision to seek out his profile again. I don\'t know what else I expected other than dozens of posts talking about how he hangs out with Adolf Hitler, and (contextually) creepy as fuck photos of young Maddie Ziegler. It makes it even harder to deal with, knowing I couldn\'t even see a therapist or support group about this. The personal details in this are probably enough to get me recognized, but I can\'t even care anymore. Autogynephiles are a scourge and a menace. I\'ve had it up to fucking here, y\'all\n\n&#x200B;', 'I just hit a severe peak.  First I read the thread about a white TIM going to a center for Muslim refugee women, which was disgusting and appalling.  Then I got on Facebook to see that a TIM I know impregnated a really young TIF, and they’re going to have the baby.  Poor kid doesn’t stand a chance.', ""I'm peaking again, who knew. Had a dialogue with a self-professed female. Yep, you read that correctly. The definition of female is irrelevant to this person because he feels like he's felt female his entire life, associating with the word trans, or male is wrong and gross to him and incorrect. Apparently transitioning makes a male a female. My head has been spinning because there is zero logic behind that. These are some sick sick men that are trying to infringe on our spaces. It gets worse everyday."", 'Just dropping another peak trans moment. ""I\'m a man but I\'m celebrating mother\'s day for myself.""\n\nI feel like this woman is trying to hide from the trauma of an abusive relationship by calling herself a man. ', ""So I re-peak just about every time I get on Twitter. \n\nThere’s a person I follow on Twitter who’s not verified but has a huge following. She also uses “they/them” pronouns, and while I’m not 100% sure whether or not she identifies as non-binary, the pronoun thing is a decent indicator that she falls under the trans umbrella, right? Anyway, she posted a tweet expressing her desire that “men with dicks” not talk to her. In the same tweet she said that men with vaginas, ladies, theydies, etc. were fine, just not cis men. I scrolled down to see the replies and it was an absolute shit show. She was being attacked by people of all genders for being transphobic, but especially by transmen (FtMs/TIFs). Here are a handful of the replies I saw: \n\n“As a trans man this literally ruined my day.”\n\n“Hello as a trans guy this literally made me sigh. We're no fucking different than cis men other than how we’re born. If you're gonna be awful to men, be awful to ALL of us.”\n\n“Be inclusive without providing me with dysphoria.”\n\n“This is extremely triggering for people with dysphoria but mkay.”\n\n“Wow.. Thanks for the invalidating post I guess. Glad to know I'm more of a man light™.”\n\nMy first thought was that this was just so laughable..? If you don’t like what someone says, unfollow them or block them. In any case though, no one just automatically deserves validation from the people they follow. The OP has tens of thousands of followers; she can’t possibly please them all with everything she says. \n\nBut then I noticed how rude and awful the transmen were being. I understand that there’s varying forms of internalized misogyny that they face, but I couldn’t understand their desire to be grouped with cis men in this context. Why would you want to be grouped with the awful cis men? It was like the opposite of “Not All Men”...”Yes All Men!!!” Like the TIFs were saying, “Yes, all men are awful, and we’re ready to accept that role!” Here they were, berating this girl on Twitter, acting just like men, trying to make the situation about them. \n\nI don’t know the context of OP’s tweet, but it read as though she’d just experienced something traumatic/triggering. It’s just like a man, though, to intrude in woman’s space and complain and make demands to be centered. These TIFs wanted so badly to be men, and in the process, they let the misogyny come out. Even though OP looks like a typical AFAB enby (meaning her personal style is GNC but you can still tell she’s female) and uses they/them pronouns, the TIFs were we’re treating her exactly the way men treat women. Forget the fact that OP (most likely) falls under the trans umbrella. She’s not as trans as the transmen. I felt like I was experiencing some kind of deja vu. I’ve seen discourse like this between TIMs and lesbians. It was the Oppression Olympics all over again; the sport was the same, but only the players had changed.\n\nNow, as I reflect on what I read—a thread in which the majority of participants were AFAB people who use “he/him” or “they/them” pronouns—all I’m wondering is why they hate (being) women so much. Sure, we’re treated like crap. But why try to distance yourself from that only to end up treating other women that way?"", '[deleted]', 'Peaked long ago but made an account to vent about work.

So done with how everyone bows and scraps to the mere suggestion they\'re anything less than enthusiastic gender koolaid drinkers and the capitulation to an ideology that doesn\'t pass even superficial critique. Fingers crossed everything turns out okay but actively looking for a new job. \n\nBonus peak story: the time a TIM brought up hormones and them not working for him and how jealous he was of ""those things hanging off of your chest"". Meaning my breasts. ""Those things"" ffs', 'Made an alt account to start posting in here. Been lurking in the sub for a while and It\'s been so good to see that there is an entire community of like minded women.\n\nThis is gonna be a little lengthy...\n\nSo my peak trans moment is actually a collection of different moments that have occurred throughout the years. Although, I have always found something inherently and unequivocally wrong and off-putting with TRA\'s and the transfad.\n\n*Peak Trans 1.* Back in 2013 I joined a study abroad program while in college, and that was my very first face-to-face interaction with a trans who was a TiF. So she used the fact that she was a biological female in order to get a female roommate; and I just happened to be that unlucky lass. During the time that she and I were sharing the room together, she 110% identified as a man, and was very passing. All of the people who she made friends with were all men, and she had no problem inviting them into our room, while I was/wasn\'t there. I would find my things messed up, my underwear drawer looked like it had always been tampered with, and I always smelled mens cologne on my bed.  This TiF was also a porn addict, and for some reason she thought that it was completely cool to watch porn, with the volume sky high, on her laptop right in front of me. Another thing she would do was whenever she left the room, she would turn on her laptop and turn it towards my side of the room. It was sick.\n\nSo she considered herself a straight male, and she made it a point to regularly remind me that she found me attractive. She acted just like a disgusting  porn obsessed guy, and it made me so damn uncomfortable. So after an entire month of enduring this, I finally wrote a letter to the program organizers explaining that I felt disturbed, unsafe, was being sexually harassed by my transman roommate, and that I refused to pay my second deposit until I got a new room. It took a week for them to respond to me and another two weeks for them to actually move her to a different room. However, the day after they moved her, these fools demanded that I come in to the head-office to apologize to all of the libfem organizers for all the ""nasty things"" that I said about the TiF. (Nasty things = ""transman is sexually harassing me, and bringing male friends into the room, and I fear for my safety."")\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Peak Trans 2.* My second encounter was with a TiM just 2 years later in late 2015 while still in college. We were both art majors so he popped up in a lot of my art classes. This TiM was one of the creepiest people that I had ever met in my life. He did and said a lot of perverted shit to the women in the class, but they would just uncomfortably giggle and do nothing about it, because they were all libfems, and didn\'t want to seem transphobic. Oh and he had no problem calling women transphobic when they stood up to him. I had a figure drawing class with him, and right after every class session, when the nude model would step off the podium to go get dressed, he would immediately stop her and try to hold a conversation with her while she was butt-booty-ass naked. Like, he would literally stand directly in front of her to stop her from going to the storage room to get dressed. He was so rude and disgusting to all of the women in class, and during class critique he would always give the most disgusting and harsh ""critique"" to women. Only women. He didn\'t play that shit with the men in the class. The instructors never said anything, and would turn a blind eye. The women in the class wouldn\'t say anything, and would let him get away with it, lest he accuse them of being transphobic  and misogynistic.\n\nFast forward a few years later to 2019. I told my boyfriend this story last week, and that the TiM\'s preferred name was Lily. My boyfriend\'s eyes get wide, and he tells me to hold on a minute while he pulls out his phone and goes through his IG. He pulls up the IG of a Tim, and asks me if that was the guy, and I said hell yes it was! So it turns out that my boyfriend used to work with this very same TiM a few years ago, and he tells me that the TiM got fired for stalking female co-workers, sexually harassing them, and wearing skirts over his uniform, to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Peak Trans 3.*  Laverne Cox saying that he wanted to redefine black womanhood, or some shit.  So sick of TRA\'s trying to piggyback black women\'s issues and insert TiM\'s in with WOC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Peak Trans 4.*  Seeing TRA\'s on twitter pulling shit statistics out of their asses about how ""transwomen are violently murdered at an alarming rate, more than any other minority group of women, every year"" and they are actually keeping track of how many are killed (though I don\'t know where exactly they are getting the numbers), yet they do not say shit about, nor do they care about, the amount of actual women who are violently murdered every year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Peak Trans 5.* Seeing digital artists on Tumblr and Twitter being harrassed and attacked by TRA\'s for not drawing ""cute trans girls.""', "" My peak trans was a LONG process that took me years to finally reach. (This will be rambly)\n\nI am an ex-libfem for a long time and I used to believe ALL the BS. That gender was a feeling, you were what ever you said you were, etc. It got to a point where I was so confused about my own gender that I identified as gender fluid then agender because I never FELT like a woman so I must not be one. I also said I was pan because I had internal homophobia but I have accepted myself now and have come out as a lesbian.\n\nAnyways, the first step to my peak trans was actually a friend of mine. He is a trans man, we will call him L and I will be using he/him because as long as you show me respect I usually do use preferred pronouns. L was EVERYTHING you would expect with a libfem trans man. He was trans but did not have dysphoria. He was VERY pro self-diagnosing, so he said he had dyslexia, DID, autism, and SO MUCH MORE. This is the first thing that didn't make sense to me. My family has a medical background so I am VERY against self-diagnosing, self advocating yes though. And when he said he didn't have dysphoria I became confused. He was also very into kin which never made sense to me.\n\nHe was actually the one who accidentally got me introduced into the radfem community. He said TERFs were the devil but he couldn't actually tell me what they believed in. So, I looked it up. I read blog after blog after blog and... I agreed. THIS made sense to me. So, I made a blog and jumped in. I had question my sexuality at this point, but then a guy asked me out and I felt like I HAD to do it. (Homophobic family that I didn't want to disappoint so I forced myself to date him even though I was never sexually attracted to him, we never went that far though so yay)\n\nHe was also into gender politics but in the opposite side so I deleted my blog and back off. But then something happened.\n\nI go to college and there was an LGBTQ club and I went... but there was also a 50+ year old man there in a ratty wig and a dress that was WAY to short for my comfort and he had a scraggly beard. And... he was being *fawned over*. These 19 year old NB women were just gushing over this greasy man because he was trans. All of this just set off warning bells in my head and I got out of there fast. I'm not sure if the compliments aroused him, but there was definitely a reaction from him that I wanted no part of.\n\nIt was disgusting to me that this grown man wanted to be showered with compliments from women half his age. He wanted advice to how to seem more girly and they were giving it to him. This was the breaking point. I went back to reading radfem blogs and my bf (then fiancee) and I split. It hurt because we had been so close (and it still hurts because he broke my trust and I fucking left him) but it was for the best. I got to learn about myself and accept who I was. I met people irl who agreed with my thoughts on the trans movement and I gained the courage to get out there with my beliefs.\n\nTLDR: Friend was a transtrender and introduced me to radfems accidentally and then I saw a grown man get off on being called a girl by teens."", 'I was going to drop the name and peace out, but that might be against rules.

Nah, this user is an embodiment of every awful attribute this sub has described. So awful, he recently was banned from trollx. Even they couldn\'t take it anymore. He posted furry porn of children\'s characters, admitted to being a pedo, proclaimed he is transage, has threatened violence, thinks these women ""should die"", is a ""lesbian"" with a penis, admitted to spreading lies about his ex partners having STDs, hates on other trans people, goes on women\'s centered subs and causes general havoc, he has a kiwifarms thread where his antics go back even further from where he started to pop up on my radar.

My peak trans moment was not some monumental occurrence, like many of you it was a slow build till I knew I had had enough. I have always kinda had questions about what it means to be trans or non-binary and why anyone would change genders, but I maintained an ally stance for the most part. Over the last few years as I have become more politically progressive I found myself in a lot of FB groups with liberal feminist women. I just kinda went along with the whole “you are whatever you identify as” even though I never fully bought it. However with all of the awful anti abortion legislation that has come out the past few weeks across the US I couldn’t help but notice how a lot of my girlfriends were more concerned with correcting others on the use of the word women than they are with actually fighting back against what is happening. I swear it’s like something just snapped inside of me and all of the damn questions and doubts I had about the whole transgender/non-binary trend had been confirmed to be true. These women don’t care about other women. They care about being special snowflakes and are demanding the rest of us cater to their need to be the center of every convo regarding women’s issues. I am officially done with all of the bullshit and am just relieved to know that I am not alone in my extreme exasperation.', 'When I saw males starting to win gold in women’s sports while women were told to shut up and cheer in the name of “progress,” I was fucking done with this nonsense.', 'Not exactly peaktrans but peak libfem: two young adult authors trying to out-woke each other on Twitter by talking about how the depiction of sex work in teen novels should be more positive.\n\nIN TEEN NOVELS.', 'I won’t go into it too much but I’ve been told being upset at the mention of male transgenders because I was molested by one is transphobic.

I don\'t live in dresses and made-up to the eyeballs everyday. And then someone linked an article on twitter about some dude who climbed a mountain and then posed with a dress and heels at the top - wtf? I\'ve climbed a lot, do a lot of hiking and never once have I gone  - ooh I\'ll just whip my dress and heels out now. Ever since then I\'ve fallen down this interesting, enraging and logical rabbit hole that is gender critical and radical feminism. The posts on here and some of the threads on Twitter are so encouraging to know you\'re not alone. I definitely can\'t speak my mind due to my job (in mental health services) but it\'s such a relief to know you\'re not the only one that won\'t accept this illogical trend.', ""I've hit my peak trans on tumblr. I've spent *a lot* of time on that website, a solid few years, and for most of it I've been on the more liberal MOGAI-esque part of it. Multiple posts have taught me to hate those evil terfs and their insane ideology, so I never bothered looking up radfem beliefs. Everyone told me it was bad, so it had to be bad, right?\n\nI obsessively worshipped trans women, agreed with them on everything, did whatever I could to validate them, explicitly stated in my bio that I am 'cis' to please everyone and asked them to let me know if I said anything offensive. At the same time, I had a hard time accepting my sexuality and even though deep down I knew I wasn't attracted to male bodies, I actively tried convincing myself I was.\n\nAfter some time, I started having doubts. More and more users were getting called out for saying something 'offensive' to trans people (mostly trans women), blocklists were created, users started getting anonymous hate and threats for reblogging something from radfems. I was confused and, frankly, a bit scared. What if I said something bad and my friends turned on me, declaring me an evil terf?\n\nThen I saw that one comic, 'What cis people say vs what we hear'. I stared at it in disbelief and confusion. Because... What *are* we supposed to say if trans people deem every single normal question an oppressive statement? The comic suggested we should just shut up and not question anything, ever. I became upset. I wanted to talk about my experiences as a woman, but I couldn't. It was transphobic. I wanted to educate myself on my own biology, but it was transphobic. My attraction to females was transphobic. My sex was transphobic. *Everything* was transphobic.\n\nI decided to google what those 'evil terfs' actually were. As it turned out, I agreed with a lot of points in radical feminism. Then I made a new tumblr account and followed some people. People who could say what they thought without the fear of being ostracized, people who had scientific sources to back up their arguments, people who actually cared about women like me. I felt good and finally accepted.\n\nAnd, well. Here I am. From deep genderfluid hell to radical feminism on a single website. Thanks, tumblr!"", 'I don\'t know if this constitutes a peak, but I was just banned from /r/atheism for speaking negatively about transwomen.

To continue the doctor parallel, no medical professional would amputate someone\'s arm on the grounds that the patient felt like he was ""supposed"" to be one-handed.\n\n>A lot of women are identifying as men because they are taught that women are a second-class citizen. Their bodies are hypersexualized by porn and the media, and they want to escape and be treated as genuine human beings. But agreeing to mutilate their bodies and pretend that biology doesn\'t exist is not the way to help them.\n\n---\n\n>They can have the surgery if they want to -- just like with religion, I don\'t want to tell people what they have to believe -- but it simply doesn\'t make any sense that a person\'s chromosomes, genitalia, hormones, and secondary sex characteristics do not define their sex, while some nebulous, regressive idea of ""brain sex"" would. If a boy likes the color pink, is he actually a girl? If a woman is confident and assertive and doesn\'t adhere to harsh beauty standards, should we start calling her a man?\n\n>As for why it matters, look into Jonathan Yaniv, a man who claims to be a woman and who talks endlessly about seeing 10- to 12-year old girls\' ""tits and vag"" and inserting tampons into them. He is a pedophile, but is being widely protected because he calls himself a transwoman. He also sued a lot of beauty salons because they refused to wax his balls, which he said was discriminatory because he is a woman and they service women.\n\n>In just the same way that I won\'t let someone tell me that I have a soul and was born with original sin, I won\'t pretend that someone who has a Y chromosome and a penis is a woman, and vice versa.\n\n>I\'m actually kind of surprised to see the atheist subreddit reacting so negatively to these ideas. Although I\'m open to having a dialogue and changing my mind, I believe that the idea that ""transwomen are women"" is fundamentally irrational and toxic.', 'Okay my peak trans story time - \nI had always been super supportive of the transgender movement, ever since 2010 when I read an article in the Boston Globe about a young TIM from Maine. The story really moved me and I truly felt like it was possible for someone to be born in the “wrong” body. \n\nEver since that moment I defended the transgender movement - from Bruce Jenner coming out, to agreeing with TIMs when they labelled menstrual art shown at the Women’s March as “transphobic” and “cissexist.” I even had a TIM coworker who I defended even though he made no effort to appear feminine - even going as far as wearing a dress to work while having a full beard but insisting everyone refer to him as Kara and use female pronouns only. \n\nEven that wasn’t my peak trans moment though it was the catalyst that drove me to question the movement.  My final peak moment was when browsing tumblr I came across a blog run by a lesbian - someone I agreed with on politics and other various social issues. She described herself as a butch lesbian and was very vocal in her stance against capitalism and corporate greed. \n\n\n Turns out, this person wasn’t a butch lesbian at all - but was transgender, essentially a straight, gender conforming man who decided to call himself a butch lesbian. How can someone use these words to describe themself? It is clear appropriation of the struggle of butch lesbians, something a straight man would never understand! I was infuriated, despite not being a lesbian myself I couldn’t help but be angry. Turns out my old coworker was now calling himself a butch lesbian - a man with a full beard was saying this. \n\nIf any man can be a butch lesbian then the word has no meaning. We have definitions for male and female for a reason - you can still be a man and wear a dress but the second you insist this makes you a woman - I’m out, I can’t support something like this. Men will never know what it means to be a woman, and straight men will never know what it is like to be a lesbian. Be whoever you want but don’t lie about your biology, the essential thing that makes you who you are. \n\n', 'I\'m still a closeted ""TERF"" (I realize this can be seen as a slur), but I started having mixed feelings about the trans movement when I heard about transwomen competing in female sports and beating naturally born females.  Started researching what TRA\'s are pushing.\n\nI hit my trans peak when a facebook friend of mine posted a status that said something along the lines of ""If you aren\'t willing to date a man/woman because they are trans, YOU ARE TRANSPHOBIC,"" and that really rubbed me the wrong way.  I would consider dating a trans person, myself, but I don\'t think anyone has the right to call someone a bigot for having certain sexual preferences.  I don\'t think a lesbian should have to suck a dick to make someone feel better about their chosen sexual expression.  I don\'t think anyone is entitled to sex!  I don\'t think anyone is a bad person for wanting a mate they can LITERALLY mate with, or having a sexual preference based on specifically what\'s ""under the hood"".\n\nI have empathy for trans people.  I am a libertarian and respect their right to have surgeries and hormones or whatever to make themselves comfortable.  I do not respect the notion that you can call yourself a woman and suddenly be marginalized and demand to be welcomed to woman-specific events and places.  I don\'t respect that male-bodied transwomen are equivalent enough to naturally born women to compete against female athletes.\n\nI also don\'t like the idea that we may be enabling people with a serious mental illness that we are brushing under the rug as a personality trait and something to be proud of.  I 100% am not okay with children taking puberty blockers.', 'I’ve been posting here for awhile, but the last PT thread was closed when I joined so here I am! \n\nLike many people, my peak was a slow climb that was kind of a mix of peak trans and peak liberal feminism. \n\nI was under the impression that gender and sex were used interchangeably. I understood the need to transition from the “born in the wrong body” standpoint. I’ve struggled with an eating disorder and other mental health issues and have a lot of sympathy for what the brain can tell a person about their body, so if an adult could lead a happier life post transition I thought “why not”. There were things I heard from libfem friends about how pussy hats at a WOMEN’S march were exclusionary and just kind of assumed that the people sharing these articles were virtue signaling and that complaints about vagina imagery being transphobic were coming from a vocal fringe of people who spent too much time on tumblr. Every movement has their fringes, right? At the time, though I’m a lesbian, I wasn’t very involved with my local LGBT (oh excuse me “queer”) community so I just wasn’t paying attention to trans dynamics. \n\nOne of my friends mentioned something about someone we both know being a TERF. I had never heard the word before, so I looked at her blog, which brought me to GC. At first, I was just kind of fascinated by seeing Caitlyn Jenner called a man, but the more I read, the more what I read made sense. I was also happy to read articles and posts talking about the predatory nature of porn and people actually saying that the sex industry is not empowering. Finally, a place that actually seemed to care about women’s issues beyond “why getting my armpits waxed is a feminist choice”! \n\nMy peak moment was the cotton ceiling. Reading about it was horrifying. As I said, I’m a lesbian, and what I read was no different than conversion therapy. I read the site terfisaslur. I value critical thinking and taking ideas with a grain of salt (plus, I wanted to be a good ally etc etc) so I decided to see what a person had to say to get called a TERF or be called transphobic. After all, I reasoned, it’s easy to put a bunch of screenshots together and make it look like an opinion is widely held within a group when it isn’t. I’m in a local group for lesbians (so...actually lesbians are largely persona non grata lol) and when someone brought up aggression towards lesbians in the “queer” community I just said that I felt like it was homophobic to shame lesbians for not liking penis. That I, as a female homosexual, need a word to describe my sexual orientation. A TIM (naturally) jumped on my post and called me transphobic. I asked him how I could communicate my sexual orientation and he said “transphobic”. That was it. I was done. I had bent over backwards to use their language but I saw there was going to be zero respect for my identity. It was shocking to see other alleged lesbians bowing to this MALE and agreeing that sex is some kind of civil rights issue. I have seen more people in “queer” places fighting to normalize wanting to kink than standing up for personal boundaries. One of the questions that comes up over and over in this whole MeToo discussion is asserting boundaries. I will never ever support a movement that thinks it’s ok to shame a woman for having boundaries. I was done. And I was angry. The radikweers are destroying the LGB (and normal Ts) in the name of “inclusivity” at all costs. \n\nMy second peak moment was the reaction from the media when the women protested the erasure of lesbians. In my naïveté I thought people would be able to discuss the issue with nuance after hearing the voices of lesbians, but the way that the story was manipulated was horrifying to me as a journalism student. One thing I have always appreciated about myself is that I am willing to change my mind on issues when presented with compelling evidence. But seeing people just jump to villifying these women, choosing to stand up for sexual predators like Karen White, denying women the right to female only spaces while ignoring the unhinged behavior of trans activists is unacceptable to me. This movement is willfully obfuscating the truth. If a rape crisis center or DV shelter chooses to accept TIMs, I have no problem with that, but it should be a CHOICE. \n\nthanks to all the people who have called women TERFS for talking about biology and sexual orientation.

If ""trans rights"" were framed in a way that didn't attack women's rights, I'd join the cause. Unfortunately, modern ""trans rights"" are just about eliminating women's rights and even erasing what a woman *is* in favor of replacement with gender self-ID.

For example- Women's scholarships, women's competitions, women's prisons, women's shelters, women's career quotas, women's voices, and acknowledgement of women's realities-- the ""trans rights"" machine works tirelessly to eliminate them all, giving us [faux representation](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwinningwomenssport) instead and putting women and girls in physical danger under the guise of *tolerance*. 

Not only is acknowledging the realities of our own biological sex lambasted as TrAnsPhObIC, but so is voicing concern about the realities of the opposite sex, such as the physical threat they impose (yes, even after HRT), the 98.9% forcible rape stats, 96% global murder, 96% child sexual abuse with 1 in 20 men in USA committing it.

And are you fucking kidding me? No one on this earth knows what it means to be alienated from your own body more than ""cis"" women. 

Growing up we're slowly and subtly taught that our body isn't ours. It belongs to that boy that likes you. It belongs to those grown men catcalling at you on the street. Your head is cut off and your body plastered on ads, movie posters, not fully human. We're parsed and cut up into separate cuts of meat all the time. Our legs are wrong, our breasts are wrong, our stomachs are wrong. Sometimes our body is so ""wrong"" we get implants or liposuction. Sometimes our bodies are so foreign we starve ourselves because we're never ""skinny"" enough. Have these people forgotten that the first people on earth to experience dysmorphia, which we call dysphoria today, were *women* who didn't see our bodies the way they actually were? Our bodies are literally treated like objects that are separate from the mind. The first time I felt like my body wasn't mine was when I was 12 wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a cartoon owl on it, walking down the side of the road with my friend and being honked at several times. That's when I know that there was something wrong, that I wasn't allowed to simply exist.

I and every fucking woman alive today have been made to feel alienated about our bodies. And not just externally. There have been so many times I wished I could either detach my female physical attributes or detach my female body as a whole. 

Fuck you. *You* have no idea what it's like to be a woman. And when you say we don't know how it feels to be in the wrong body, you're proving me right.",612,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

cr5dpz,cr5dpz,Ex ‘Top Porn Star’ Jenny Lee showing how she lives now is honestly one of the saddest realities of the impact that the porn industry has on its “workers”,"I just saw this video posted on r/videos, and it is honestly so sad. [link](https://youtu.be/fW5B6ZrHkCE)
 
It goes without question that drug use is rife in the porn industry. And her usage has thoroughly destroyed her life. Not only that, look how she cringes when she’s asked her age. She knows she is no longer needed by the industry because of her age. 

She probably feels that there are no jobs open to her because instead of gaining a good education for long term job aspirations she turned to focus on pornography, which has obviously damaged her mental health and disposed of her at her darkest times.

Why are people still promoting this? It’s honestly so disgusting, these women, Even the most ‘successful’  ones are vulnerable. 


It’s sad that the original post on r/videos was all comments saying “I used to love her videos!! Such a shame”. So many pathetic men that have no empathy for her position in life. Them videos made her that way.  Also, she probably gains 0 royalties from most the videos she put out now....",606,"[""Those young liberal feminists - especially the ones in the sex industry who parrot the line ''sex work is empowering'' should watch this video and see what they really mean to men. Once men no longer find these women in the sex industry attractive, or more likely, once these women are past a certain age, men chuck them away . The sad thing is, it's only when these young women grow into their 30s and beyond that they will see how little men actually value them and were only using them.\n\nOf course, young women think that they will nver grow older - we all think like that when we are young, when we are in our 20s we think that we will always be young and never one of those ''old people''. \n\nMen simply couldn't care less about women in the sex industry, they only care about their own d\\*ck. But young liberal feminist women can't see this and they won't see it until they to are thrown away for some new early 20 year old."", 'Linda Lovelace ended up on welfare if I am not mistaken.

The “such a shame” part is usually something along the lines of “I just discovered her vids and now she’s dead. Such a shame there won’t be any more fresh stuff from her!” Yeah, ZERO empathy.

It's so upsetting that anyone with any shred of humanity wouldn't understand that having sex for money is destructive to people, especially women.   \n\n\nThere is a podcast called The Butterfly Effect. It is Jon Ronson, who I generally enjoy as a journalist, and it is very interesting and there's a lot of discussion of how free internet porn is pervasive and not all good fun. However, it is also an example of how a man will buy what other men are saying and so will the women who need money. The story they try to sell is that how dare society shame ANYONE for this stuff. And then they talk about how women have to look VERY young (in order to pass as jailbait) and then they have to look older (in order to appeal to the concept of MILFs), so if you're in your mid-20s through early30s, you're just out of luck. (Or, as I said out loud when I was listening, SO SO LUCKY RUN.)  \n\n\nRonson is also fairly well known for his book about shaming people online and in the podcast, the example he gives of a person unfairly followed by a porn past is -- take a deep breath -- A MAN. And, in my least favorite story in the situation, he discusses bespoke porn (since everything's free, people are making videos specific to an individual to make money). The example is a married couple who claim that they're recording them having sex in their home because they didn't want to downsize when they financial crisis hit. The main complication is they have a daughter and at lunch at middle school, some boy showed her a porn video on his phone and it was her mom and dad doing it IN HER BEDROOM. Because even the custom stuff gets out into the world and is free.  \n\n\nAnd Ronson is talking about this with the mother and he's explaining to her that the mother shouldn't feel bad and the daughter is being unreasonable.   \n\n\nI'll just leave it there because it was literally a moment when I was completely shocked. People do misguided and wrong-headed things all the time. ALL. THE. TIME. But the idea that a person would blame a CHILD for being upset that her mom sold a video of herself having sex in her daughter's bedroom and somehow it's the kid who is being childish about it just took my breath away.  \n\n\nMen gonna men.  \n\n\nI hope we can be compassionate to the women who end up in the grinding maw of this terrible industry.

It's so disheartening."", ""Back when I drank the porn kool aid two of my favorite performers were Ginger Lynn and Asia Carrara.

I was a stripper for 5 years, and this is very similar to the life of a stripper. Once they hit their 40s, they have no other prospects, so they're stuck in the clubs having to compete with girls half their age and have a difficult time making any money. If they're lucky, the club will give them a job as a waitress once they get to the point they can't make any money anymore. Basically, the older women work the day shift, which is slower, and the younger, prettier women work night shift when it's busier. So once you get to a certain age, you get demoted to day shift. Usually, the only way they can make any money is to undercut the younger girls by offering to do things in VIP that the younger girls won't do for half the price, so they basically become prostitutes. A few of them can still make some money without resorting to that, but there will come a time when they can't work anymore, and now they have no job skills, no experience, no education, and they'll end up somewhere working minimum wage."", 'It’s so sad listening to her speak; she’s an intelligent woman.

These disgusting men take advantage of women with no other options. Out of all the sex industry jobs, porn is the worst. All are bad with negative effects on women but porn is just so extreme and is the least well paid.

Nope. Not my male Facebook friend, who wrote the post. Not his sympathizing male friends who commented.

It was I, Melanie, who got flamed publicly and inboxed. 

And not by a TiM either. By a sympathizing female liberal, who is being brainwashed into hating her own kind.

She told my sister that we “women” have to stick together, which includes TiMs in her eyes, and that I was not participating in our “sisterhood”. Whatever that means.

My sister then asked her why she felt the need to threaten and insult me and she replied that “TERFs are bottom feeding scum” or something of the sort, Whatever that means, I’m certainly not a bottom feeder in any sense. She then blocked her too. Of course.

aczcjy,aczcjy,im being told to respect my rapists pronouns and its making me feel crazy,"im sorry if this doesn’t follow rules or anything but im just looking to talk to someone. my boyfriend understands but there’s only so much insight you can get from one person and i don’t know where to turn. 

in hs i was raped by someone who i thought was a close friend. it’s been about three years. i had a substance abuse problem, specifically with benzos, and they took advantage of that. they sent me a text the next day apologizing and telling me what had happened. i kept the texts and got a drug test administered just in case. word got out about what happened, and i was hit with a cease and desist letter for slander from their lawyer telling me to stop engaging in my “slanderous behavior”. i come from a poor family, and even with the overwhelming evidence i had that i wasn’t lying, didn’t have the energy or finances to defend myself

many people know about it but i stopped talking about it. last night i had to drive past their house to get to another friends, and the person i was with brought my rapist up and gave me a detailed update on their life, down to how many people were donating to their gofundme for surgery to transition. she wanted to “let me know about their new pronouns just in case i ever had to talk about them again” so that i wouldn’t misgender my rapist, because “even though they’re a piece of shit, we’re still going to be respectful” 

i feel really gross. why the fuck would you bring that up... i haven’t checked up on my rapist since I got that cease and desist. she really gave me a detailed update on a rapists life to make sure that i would use correct pronouns if it ever came up for me to talk about the time i was raped. ive spent three years trying to move on from this. my rapist has over $1000 on gofundme for gender reassignment surgery and im supposed to recall what happened to me in order to be respectful to a rapist, not myself. 

im sorry if this isn’t worded well, i just wanted to tell someone because if i tell any of my friends they’ll probably get mad at me for being transphobic. i don’t know if this is the right place to go. i generally don’t really care about identity politics. i just feel hurt that people care so much about their feelings that they’re willing to tell a rape victim to have some respect for their pronouns.

She called me transphobic a few months ago, and so I explained how the word transphobia is thrown around to oppress women. I don’t give a stuff how a woman interprets femininity or how a man interprets masculinity, but their inherent sex cannot change and will never change.

* Is it fair for males to compete with girls and women in women's sports? 

* Should women be called ""cis women"" even when they don't identify with sexist gender roles, just because they aren't trans?

* Should girls who don't like dolls or dresses be treated with double mastectomies and lifelong hormones? 

* Should women be shamed as trans-exclusionary for talking about our reproductive health and anatomy? Are ""pussy hats"" transphobic?

* Is it acceptable for lesbians to be bullied for not wanting to have relationships with trans women? Doesn't the struggle against the ""cotton ceiling"" contradict everything we've been saying about enthusiastic consent and rape culture?

* Should women be denied the option of not seeing a penis in a women's shower room? Is it really transphobia that makes women alarmed at seeing males in women-only spaces? 

* Is it transphobic for women to not want trans women in women-only rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, or prisons?

Never did he hint at it by asking if I was comfortable with trans individuals. We talk about the usual small talk. Likes, dislikes, seeing if we had any friends in common, stupid stuff. I know I expressed that I used to consider myself bisexual, but I figured out that my discomfort from sex was due to penises. He said nothing.

The date went well and we went back to my place. I’m not going to go into detail but eventually, after I was vulnerable (naked after oral), he began to undress and revealed to me that he had a penis. Without thinking I said something along the lines of ‘holy shit, no.’ He had the gall to act confused as to why I, a lesbian who had expressed in previous conversations that I didn’t like penises, was freaking out.\n\nAt first, he tried to convince me. PIV sex with another woman felt *so* different than with a *man*. I would enjoy it, just give *him* a chance.

What set me off was when I relayed the story to a “lesbian” friend with a TIM partner at the time. She said what’s the issue with a, and I’m quoting here, “big ole bio dick.” She said she felt fine with her partner and wasn’t by his genitalia.

But I kept these feelings to myself, figuring that there was just something I wasn\'t understanding about what it meant to be transgender. I remained skeptical but open-minded and I always tried to be polite to transgender people. I used their new names, preferred pronouns, tried my best not to misgender them and to be exclusive etc. But there were three big experiences that made me much more critical towards transgender individuals and TRAs. Here is experience ONE:\n\nI am a neuroscience researcher. One project that I was collaborating on in my PhD program as a study looking at math-related stereotype threat in young women. For those of you who don\'t know, stereotype threat is when people  feel themselves to be at risk of conforming a negative stereotype about their social group. Because of these fears individuals sometimes really do end up doing poorly at the task. For example, because there is a stereotype that women are worse at math than men, women can do poorly at math tasks simply because they are mentally preoccupied with confirming that negative stereotype.\n\nIn this study, we collected data from both men and women and compared them on a variety of different dependent variables.\n\nOne of the participants I ran was a MTF transgender individual. This was an fMRI study, so I was running subjects one-at-a-time. The TIM participant had to fill out a demographics questionnaire that asked for their sex. He double checked with me regarding whether he should put his biological sex or gender, and I told him that he should put biological sex for that question and that the next question on the questionnaire would ask for gender identify. No big deal. He asked why those were important for the study, I just said we weren\'t supposed to tell participants too much about the purpose of the study and he would be debriefed after he was done. Data collection went fine and afterwards he stayed behind and talked to me about the purpose of the study, the anticipated results, etc. I told him that this was a study on stereotype threat.\n\nHe seemed to find the topic interesting and asked if biological sex or gender identify was more important, and if I thought that TIMs would be susceptible to math-related stereotype threat in the same way that ""cis"" women are.\n\nI told him that I thought that was a very interesting question that I didn\'t know the answer to because not a lot of work had been done at that point on ST in transgender individuals. I hypothesized out loud that I would assume based on the research that MTF transgenders probably would NOT experience stereotype threat in the same way that cis women would, because they were socialized as males growing up. I wasn\'t sure about FTM transgender people.\n\nApparently that was NOT the answer he wanted to hear. He seemed fine with my answer when I gave it to him, but later I got called into a meeting by my project supervisor and the department head. The TIM in question had complained about me being ""transphobic"" and called me a bigot. All for saying that BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON STEREOTYPE THREAT THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUGGEST THAT A LATER-TRANSITIONING MTF TRANSGENDER WOULD EXPERIENCE MATH-RELATED STEREOTYPE, DUE TO EARLY MALE SOCIALIZATION.\n\nI was baffled. I didn\'t bar this person from doing the study. I didn\'t misgender them. Hell, I didn\'t even include his data in with the male participants\' data in the subsequent analyses. I explained the situation to my supervisor and the head, and they were sympathetic towards me, thankfully. But I saw this TIM around the department and every time he would shoot me eye daggers and make snide remarks. He also complained on social media about me, calling me a bitch, accusing me of harassing him and being uneducated, etc. The acronym TERF wasn\'t really used back then, but if it was I\'m sure I would be called a TERF as well. And he had tons of friends on social media lavishing him with sympathy and praise for standing up to the bigot in the psych department.\n\nThis wasn\'t what made me peak trans, but it did make me rethink my attitude that all TIMs were innocent women who could do no wrong.\n\nWill share my other two peak trans stories later!', 'My peak trans story happened a year ago when my boyfriend of 4 years came out as MTF when I tried to break up with him. (Sorry if this is a bit disorganized and long)\n\nI had  always supported the T as part of LGB and never genuinely questioned anything much prior to that. Thus, at first although I was devastated I tried to support him (painted his nails with my favorite polish, told him I loved him for who he was and not his gender etc). \n\nOne of the first things that snapped me back to reality was some of the very cruel things he said along the way. I jokingly told him the first day I didn’t care too much what he wore as long as he wasn’t prettier than me. He gave me this very disdainful look and said “I mean that would kinda be the point.” Later he also told me he was glad my friends weren’t attractive because he would get dysphoric around attractive women. \n\nI started realizing how many lies he had told me to make the story he was telling me true. I continued to try to support him because I feared being labeled a transphobe if I left him immediately after he came out (even though I was trying to breakup even before this started). This resulted in a slump of depression. He would get angry when I cried and tell me I was being unsupportive even though I explained I was sad due to the lies rather than his identity. He would follow me to continue this criticism if I left the room even taking out headphones I wore if I tried to bury myself in music to cope. \n\nSome gems he disclosed  during the following week included having been cross dressing for years behind my back (especially when I was out of town), talking to trans people for years online about his feelings (never thinking to share it with me), having a massive porn addiction (especially to sissification porn) and having posed as a woman online to catfish men. Apparently along with the porn thing he had been penetrating himself with random objects around the house and masturbating incessantly whenever I wasn’t home while wearing my clothes. This truly disgusted me on so many levels I can’t even begin to describe it. He also wanted to be a “stay-at-home-mom,” quit his job, and draw cartoons from home for fun while I would presumably support us both financially. \n\nIn the process of trying to understand how being trans worked for him, I asked what it felt like to be a woman to him. He described the most insulting list of stereotypes such as feeling delicate, submissive, wanting to be cute, being weak, emotional etc. I pointed out those were actually inaccurate and insulting stereotypes and  how little this aligned with my own personality as a woman. He actually told me in response I was just an anomaly and didn’t count or know what women felt. I REPEAT: THE DUDE TOLD ME HE KNEW BETTER WHAT BEING A WOMAN IS LIKE! He also sighted “phantom limb” for having an hourglass figure, wide hips, and large breasts. Baffled, I pointed out that few women truly have that shape and that we come in all kinds of shapes without having “phantom limb” but was shouted down again for being unsupportive and transphobic. \n\nA particularly infuriating moment was when I tried to have a serious discussion and he told me I couldn’t expect maturity from him  because he was now “a little girl” since he was starting over. \n\nA very scary moment was when he told me about how hard coming out can be for trans people and cited a case where the stress of coming out led one man to murder his pregnant wife. I was so terrified since he never made any disclaimer to say such an action was wrong or assure me he wouldn’t hurt me. I have never been sure if this was intentionally meant as a threat. The way he said it was chilling because it was as though he thought that was just a normal response to do something so violent in the process. \n\nAfter about a week of this I gave up the pretense of support and demanded to know “the rest” (I had this sense there was more from the beginning). This was where things escalated to an even more extreme level. He admitted to having been hiring pre-op trans males to have sex with for most of our relationship. I immediately made him get out, leave his keys behind and blocked him on everything. \n\nAfter kicking him out he stalked me, I learned he had been using my image to catfish online, he spread rumors of me being abusive and transphobic, I ended up having to leave my own home and hide with friends/family and eventually had to get a restraining order. \n\nAt one point after the split he sent me a package. I realized nothing in it would EVER change how I felt about him so I sent it back unopened. He contacted my mom in a rage to tell her we were both hateful transphobic people and that we had RUINED HIS CLOSURE by sending it back. \n\nShockingly, despite the cheating, threats, insults, stalking, and identity theft a number of my own friends and family reached out to try to support him specifically because he was now identifying as trans and they were also concerned for him. I cannot imagine if he hadn’t identified that way that anyone who cares about me would have reached out to a cis man who had done the same. I genuinely believe this prolonged him stalking me. I think it validated his feelings that in some way he was the real victim and my refusal to stay and tolerate his behavior was comparable to a hate crime. \n\nI found radical feminism after a search to try to understand if some of the worst things he had said were isolated to just him or part of the wider trans culture. It turns out I have found a lot of people with similar questions to what I found myself faced with through this experience! It has really helped reading other stories on here.', 'I reached peak trans in the abstract long ago, but today I had an experience that made me finally reach peak nonbinary in a much more grounded way, so I thought I’d share it. \n\nI haven’t had much contact with nonbinaries irl (my native language doesn’t have an agreed-upon neutral pronoun, so that limits the trend I think) and prior to today I was willing to cut them some slack because I hadn’t quite realized just how revoltingly misogynist the whole movement is. \n\nSo, I was at a open D&D event today. Obviously, the crowd was mostly male as they tend to be at those events, but it wasn’t an hostile nerd bro atmosphere at all - just a bunch of average guys and a few women, mostly strangers, playing fantasy games together. It’s an international event, so the crowd is very mixed, and everything is very politely friendly without assuming much of a shared world view. Ordinary people, as much as game nerds can be ordinary.\n\nAt my table, however, was an archetypical tumblr NB. You know the type: clearly female, wears a binder, androgynous ‘punk’ clothes, piercings and dyed hair. Right away, this person introduces herself with they/them pronouns (unprompted, this is not a woke space) with the excuse that ‘it’s just really important’. Her character was a precious twee boi of course (and generally her approach to D&D was thoroughly tumblr, which made it even more of an internet come to life experience). She was also a dominant ass of a player, but that’s neither here nor there. \n\nNow obviously, since this was not a woke space, things did not go smoothly. I defected by only ever referring to her in the second person or as her character, but the guys at my table kept forgetting and calling this person ‘she’, because she looked, acted and sounded like a tomboy at best. In the beginning she just responded by correcting with ‘they’, which, sure, whatever. I can deal with that even if constant correxing is obnoxious and domineering. But THEN really quickly it turned from insisting on the pronoun she wanted to repeatedly emphasizing that she were NOT a girl and would NOT be called ‘she’ in this disgusted tone of voice that made ‘girl’ sound like the worst insult, over and over again. Of course ‘he’ was fine, all her characters were male, but ‘she’ was offensive and insulting. It honestly felt like her ‘identity’ wasn’t ‘neutral’ so much as just ‘not some nasty GIRL’. \n\nObviously, I’ve met this type online before, but this was my first IRL experience with someone like this, and I was actually surpised by how much it hurt me. Hearing my sex referred to with that level of contempt was legitimately painful, especially from someone who objectively speaking is a woman herself, and ESPECIALLY in otherwise all-male company where I already feel kind of self-conscious about my sex. Like, sure, just talk about what I am as if it’s endlessly disgusting to a bunch of guys, that’s not hurtful or misogynist at all. Just take your own internalized misogyny out on the only woman in the room who admits to being one.\n\nAnd through all this, she kept acting towards me like we should be great friends and she was not at all being the biggest misogynist in a room full of gamer bros. All I could do was just refuse to engage with her as much as possible for the rest of the game. Legitimately no man has made me feel as bad about being female at the gaming table as this person did. \n\nOn some level I know I should feel sad for her because how much she’s clearly hating herself and how hopeless her quest to escape femaleness is, but right now I just don’t care. You don’t want to be a lowly woman? Fine. But don’t expect me to be nice to you, don’t expect my sisterhood when you throw me all every other woman under the bus like that.\n\nFuck her, fuck her pronouns, and fuck nonbinary.', 'My peak trans has been building for awhile but peaked today. Over the weekend I commented on a news article online about “pregnant people”. I stated that only women could become pregnant. A TIF commented that she wasn’t a woman yet had a child. So I said “Oh you’re a TIF. I’m thankful that we live in a country that allows you to identify as you wish”. She then kept insisting she wasn’t female and scorned me and said I didn’t know anything about biology, which is funny, because I have a doctorate in biology, which I mentioned in a comment. Anyway there was some back and forth, nothing crazy. Today I got a phone call from HR at my place of employment that someone contacted them and reported me for harassing a transgender person and making hateful comments that were anti-science. I sent HR the original posts before deleting them off fb (to avoid any further controversy - just not worth it) and they agreed that I did nothing wrong. From the details provided by them I was able to figure out who reported me, she is a female activist, that based on her internet history, has a GED.  I can’t get over the irony that someone with barely a high school education could argue that my 13+ years of postgraduate education and advanced training are completely invalidated and I don’t know anything about sex and biology. I also can’t get over that she spent half an afternoon stalking me to figure out where I work and try to get me fired. This is madness.', 'Peak trans: it is okay to have all-trans productions of The Vagina Monologues, but not okay to have only cis actresses.\n\nI hate this timeline.', 'Peak for me was a couple of years ago. I was at a small bonfire with the friends of a friend I just met (I used to call myself queer but when I moved from a large city to a smaller town I switched to lesbian thinking that made more sense to the locale). I was talking to a man with a beard and a pink highlight in his hair. I didn’t know what his sexual orientation was and I didn’t care but he was interested in mine so I told him I was a lesbian. His response was “so what do you mean by that?” I was pretty taken aback but still answered something along the lines of “it means I only date women and non binary people (it’s incredible hard these days to find young wlw who identity as women so that modifier is necessary or I’d be single forever) and he starts his interrogation with “so would you date trans women?” I knew what he was doing now. I responded “I date women.” Trans women are women right? My answer didn’t need any more details. “Okay well would you date someone with a penis?” I couldn’t think of a response so I just repeated “I date women”. Which again, if this man believes that women can have a penis, nothing I’ve said is incriminating. And keeps going . “ I have a penis, would you have sex with me?” There it is. “No because I’m not attracted to you” “why not?” Now I start to stand up for myself. “I don’t need to be interrogated by a random person I literally just met about my sexual orientation, which genitals I prefer, and whether or not I’m interested in a strangers dick”. His response was to tell me to just calm down and that “I’m only trying to protect my trans friends”. So there we have it, cis hetero men are appropriating trans discussions and using it solely to sexually harass women and then try to bait them into admitting they’re transphobic by interrogating them about genital preference. This guy honestly thought that he could guilt anyone into sleeping with him by spinning them into a web where they’re forced to say that they have 0 preference of what they’re attracted to bc that would be (gasp) transphobic', 'Re-peaked today when I saw a TIM post on r/UnethicalLifeProTips. He said that if you want to “win the housing lottery” on campus, tell them you’re transgender to get the best room and newest bathrooms. \n\nHe also posts on r/ActualLesbians, and had another post in the traaaannnnssss sub about how he is “thinking like a lesbian” now. \n\n##🤦\u200d♀️', 'My peak was when a TIM said I was transphobic for being asexual.\n\nI\'m super happily asexual. I tried for years to understand \'what was wrong with me\'  and why I didn\'t find anyone attractive. At first I thought I MUST be gay because if you\'re not attracted to men, you\'re gay (Southern logic.) Then when I had sex with a woman for the first time, I learned that relationship-wise I was down, but sex-wise I was definitely not down.  I went to a bunch of gynecologists, physical therapists, and sex therapists before I stumbled upon asexuality and hey, what do you know! I\'m asexual.\n\nWell, before that happened, I had a very good male friend who I spoke to multiple times a day. We hung out on weekends, we played video games, we were great friends. He leaned on me emotionally much more than I leaned on him, but that was fine. At  some point he asks me out, I tell him I\'m not attracted to dudes, he proceeds to drop me completely and never talk to me again. It was a super serious blow to me at the time. I thought of him as an amazing friend and couldn\'t believe that he would cut all contact and pretend I didn\'t exist after we had built up such an amazing friendship. Yes, at this point, he said I ""friendzoned"" him.\n\nFast forward to the present, he\'s now a TIM. After THREE YEARS of zero contact with me, he hits me up on messenger and proceeds to explain that he\'s transitioned and would I go out with him? I told him how much it hurt that he had dropped contact just because I turned him down, that I was now living 9 hours away, and that no, I wasn\'t interested, also I was asexual.\n\nHe proceeded to LOSE. HIS. SHIT. He called me a bitch, said he was sorry I was A T\\*RF MANIAC and a PSYCHOPATH INCAPABLE OF LOVE all because I politely turned him down twice and said how hard it was for me to lose contact completely just because I didn\'t want to date. He said it was transphobic to not consider dating him because I had originally told him I wasn\'t interested in men and he was DEFINITELY not a man, and how did I not understand that??? His typing style was over-the-top cutesy and totally a mockery of how women talk and type. I just told him I wasn\'t attracted to ANYONE, and he continued to press that it was still transphobic, because I had ""lied"" to him about not being attracted to men and that it was even MORE transphobic to say that I had ""no attraction"" to transwomen.\n\nThe whole thing was one big peak. Apparently saying ""sex isn\'t my thing, sorry"" is super transphobic (eyeroll) and knowing how long and hard it was for me to come to this conclusion that I wasn\'t a broken psychopath incapable of love is so, so important to me. He just waltzed in at the end of this journey of self-understanding and calls me a T\\*RF because I\'m not attracted to ""transwomen"" (aka, him.)\n\nI miss MY FRIEND. I miss the friend I used to support and encourage and play games with. Now he\'s obsessed with gender clownery  and guilting people into screw him. I don\'t know how this happened but I\'m deeply saddened and frustrated that he would call me a slur because I turned him down after he completely abandoned our friendship for three years.\n\nTLDR; women who aren\'t interested in sex at all are transphobic because they won\'t have sex with \'transwomen\' and it\'s totally cool to call them psychopaths incapable of love.', ""The second I saw that a transwoman had shut down the funding to a women's rape relief centre because they wouldn't allow males that identify as women in that did it for me.

You can tell this was written by a man 'lots and lots of lesbians who don't dislike dick' uhh sure jan. Then goes on to compare strap-on to dick?

For  most of my life, I\'ve enjoyed reading the news, feminist blogs, and  generally being slightly politically engaged/aware. But for various  reasons over the past 5 years I was on a near total media diet  (stressful job that only left me time for reading technical work news,  then quit the job to travel the world and only went on the internet to  organise flights, then had a baby). During that time my awareness of trans  issues was frozen at my 2014 understanding: that there is a very small %  of humans who have a severe condition that causes body dysmorphia  leading to great suffering, and that if they clear the quite high medical hurdles to have hormonal/surgical intervention to relieve their suffering, they deserve our support & respect.  \n\nRecently  I started looking at news sites and feminist blogs again, and so a  ""peak trans"" process that might have taken 5 years was accelerated into a few hours, as follows:\n\n<clicks on feminist blogs for the first time in 5 years>: Huh. There sure are a lot more  articles about transgender issues than I remember on this site about women.\n\n<keeps  clicking>: Hmm. There are lots of articles telling biological women  how to be good allies to trans women. But haven\'t they transitioned from  the dominant gender class and male socialisation? Why aren\'t there any  articles about how trans women can educate themselves to be good allies  for women?\n\n<clicks on>: ""Women have penises"" wtf?!\n\n<clicks on>: ""Lesbians should be open to having sex with ppl with penises or they are transphobic"" wtf wtf wtf?!\n\n<reads comment thread>: WHOAHHH. Also, what\'s a ""TERF""?\n\n<reads  mainstream news site>: Gosh, there sure are a lot of MTF people  competing in womens\' sports. That seems weird to me. But people take  sports so seriously, surely there has been exhaustive scientific  research specific to each sport to determine the number of years of  hormone therapy necessary to eradicate any potential competitive  advantage....\n\n<does a bit more research>: Holy s\\*\\*\\*  nobody has a clue, but going through male puberty probably has massive  permanent advantages for most sports, and male bodied people are just  coming in and taking trophies from female athletes and getting fawning  media coverage?!\n\n<views Four Corners video on Hannah Mouncey and news stories about Fallon Fox smashing a woman\'s skull>: WTF WTF WTF\n\n<finds Gender Critical reddit thread>: OMG WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE  WORLD THESE PAST FEW YEARS?! HOW DID LESBIANS GET BOOTED OUT OF THE  LGBTQ MOVEMENT AND WHY ARE LITTLE BOYS BEING GIVEN PUBERTY BLOCKERS BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO PLAY WITH DOLLS??? HOW AM I AGREEING WITH CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS ON ISSUES?!? DID I FALL INTO SOME KIND OF  ALTERNATIVE REALITY WORMHOLE WTF WTF WTF  \n\n\nI just want to note a couple more things.\n\n1.  It breaks my heart to see that the lesbian community is getting the  worst of this. I\'ve always felt a lot of respect and gratitude for the lesbian community, I know lesbians have always been on the front lines of feminism fighting for the rights I now enjoy. I have noticed that in the ""peak trans"" comment thread,  non-lesbian commenters\' peak trans moments are more likely to be along the lines of ""I read this news article about something ridiculous"" and  lesbian commenters are more likely to be ""I got rape-ily pressured to  accept a ladydick/all my women-only spaces where I was able to find community and meet romantic partners got shut down by trans activists and I don\'t have a social life anymore."" I have a male partner and a baby and none of this madness has affected my own day to day life yet. It\'s so unfair - it was hard enough to be a lesbian already!\n\n2.  This is maybe my own naivete or an insight into the kinds of assumptions people make who aren\'t deeply involved in the issues. Back  in 2014 when I was uninformed and had vaguely heard some things about bathrooms, etc, I had this assumption that there was a vast amount of  advice and information for MtT people to learn about the female  experience and undoing their male socialisation in order to fit smoothly  into womens\' spaces. I didn\'t have any evidence for this assumption, I  just unthinkingly assumed it was true because if \\*I\\* had been born into a  male body, and decided I wanted to live as a woman and be accepted into woman-only spaces, my very first concern would be making sure I didn\'t make anyone feel upset or unsafe. I just assumed there was lots and lots  of dialogue around MtT people educating themselves about feminism, learning how to be good allies, learning about the different ways that women may have been traumatised and needs special consideration, how to  communicate sensitively, etc. Of course, four years later I realise that  all the advice was going in the other direction - men lecturing women  how to support them and put their needs first!!\n\n3.  My partner is a bisexual man who has dated transwomen, and had others as friends, and I think always thought of himself as a strong ally. Like  me, he also took a few years off reading news stories and also  immediately hit peak trans along with me. He is a personal trainer and  has studied sports science, so the news stories about trans athletes  particularly piss him off.  \n\n\nI really  appreciate all the people contributing to this site and most of all the  brave people speaking up publicly in the face of what seems to be some  1984-level doublethink pressure.', 'I recently took a professional class in my field. The class was about 20 adults, mostly very woke but in a neoliberal, capitalist way. One of the people in the class looks and dresses like a young woman, but introduced themselves as non-binary, and let us know that we needed to use they/them pronouns. Okay, fine. Then the non-binary person insisted that everyone else in the room go around and say their pronouns, as well. Most people in the class had been exposed to this before and knew how to play the game, but.... another classmate was a person I read as an older butch lesbian, and she just didn\'t understand what was happening. (I think she was also hard of hearing, but of course, why accommodate real problems that make it hard for people to follow a class, when we could do this other crap instead?) \n\nInstructor: How about you? What are your pronouns? \n\nLesbian classmate: What? What do you mean, ""my pronouns""? \n\nNon-binary classmate: When people talk about you, do you want them to say ""she"" or ""he""? \n\nLesbian classmate: ...Well... I mean, I don\'t really care. It isn\'t really important to me. \n\nNon-binary classmate: But people say ""she"", don\'t they? \n\nIt gave me angry, hurt feelings to see this happen, to see a really young ""non-binary"" woman tell an older butch woman that her gender identity had to be really important to her, even though she seemed to me to be expressing that this wasn\'t a big deal to her and not something she wanted to focus on. And to just see a whole classroom of woke identity politics folks swallow this whole. While meanwhile, it was older gay and lesbian folks who had been doing so much of the heavy lifting around challenging rigid gender norms! Now suddenly that makes you bad and wrong?!? I cannot deal with this. I feel like we\'re rushing backward toward more and more rigid gender norms. \n\nFor the rest of the class time, a couple of times, one of the students would use the wrong pronoun for the non-binary person (the non-binary person gave zero clues in their presentation that they weren\'t a woman, so people were trying but slipped up once or twice) and the whole class would shut down as the person who slipped groveled. Later, my lesbian classmate told me that she had been approached by the teacher and reprimanded because she had said ""she"" when she was supposed to say ""they"". I hadn\'t thought this prior to the class, but by the end, to be honest... I felt like it was a power grab. As though this non-binary person had figured out that having a unique identity that you could force others to do labor to accommodate was a powerful strategy for getting attention and forcing others to do things for you. \n\nI felt like I was taking crazy pills. The non-binary person made it difficult to get through apolitical, technical class time, because suddenly everything would have to stop so we could all talk about decolonializing sidewalk design. I used to be much more sympathetic to issues around trans identity and identity in general, but I dunno. I later realized that I actually felt quite offended and pissed that this class had decided that we needed to stop our actual work and focus on peoples\' unrelated gender feelings so much. I had really been looking forward to learning more about things I find interesting, in a space where it doesn\'t matter if you\'re male/female/whatever. Only to find that escape is no longer possible. Even if I, as a woman, seek out spaces where my being a woman is irrelevant and we\'re all equals, now that isn\'t good enough. Now everything has to be about gender. \n\nI really resent it!', ""I peaked a long time ago, years and years back, when I was told by a TIM at work that I was lucky to have had a miscarriage. \n\nI'd had time off and was honest when I came back, and really I came back too soon, I was still heartbroken.

He actually paused for me to sympathise. It was all I could do to make an excuse and walk politely away.

He used to frequently come over later in the evening, particular when my boyfriend would be gone and I honestly think he was trying to make some kind of move on me. I eventually started saying ""I\'m super tired"" and he stopped coming around. \n\nOne night there\'s a party at the apartment complex. Someone calls him by his pre transition name and he slaps the other person, they get into a fight and he/she breaks his/her wrist. \n\nHe shows up at my law office a few weeks later. I do small criminal charges (possession, dui, traffic) and wants to sue the person who he got into a fight with. I tell him that a) the chances of it going anywhere are minimal at best b) even if he were awarded a judgment it wouldn\'t be worth it and c) both parties were under the influence of drugs and alcohol and that would make the case much more difficult. He wanted to sue the person who threw the party, I also shot that down. None of this was about advancing his/her rights as a trans person. It was a money grab. He asked if there was enough money in it to have bottom surgery. I told him that after my fee if all went well he\'d walk away with maybe a few thousand and his medical bills paid, provided the defendandnt had the cash on hand.\n\nHe tried for weeks to get me to take the case, I jokingly said I\'d do it for a huge retainer and that if he was serious he should go to another attorney who was better qualified for this kind of stuff. I called a couple of colleagues around town and told them not to entertain this case. Anyway trans dude/girl says I\'m transphobic, badmouths me and the firm I work for and tells the whole trans community that I am refusing to represent her/him because he\'s trans, I\'m refusing to represent him because his case sucks and it\'s a money grab and I don\'t even do civil cases. It would be like asking a dermatologist to perform brain surgery. He\'s threatened to call the bar association and it\'s become a headache. \n\nThe self-victimization of trans people is so off putting. The oversensitivity of the whole thing is beyond the pale. All he had to do was not to slap the person who made an honest mistake.', ""I always accepted the notion that someone who was trans had the mind of say a female but the body of a male and they wanted to change their outside to match their inside\n\nThat changed when I was on a placement at a GP. There was a male patient who had transitioned into a female in his 30's with his wife's support . Now, they were 80 and had dementia and his wife came in very distressed because he would wake up in the mornings and scream stuff like 'what have you done to my body' and wouldn't let doctors near him because he thought we had experimented on him. \n\nHe cut his long hair, threw out all his female clothes and (When he was super upset) had tried to cut of his breasts. The wife had him placed inn a home and he needed security. \n\nThe issue we had was that the wife wanted to know if he could de transition but because of his dementia he didn't have the capacity to consent.\n\nThe entire time we were dealing with this I thought that if he truly had a female mind why was he so distressed by his female body? Yes, dementia makes you forget so many things but I've never seen a patient with dementia forget their gender \n\nI'm scared that this is going to become more common as this generation ages"", 'My 14-year old “niece” (who is a lesbian) got groomed by two online  “activists” - both in their 40s.

Cue the “what about meeeennnnn who are assaulted by women? What about female on female rape?” (Yes because I’m sure you care so much about those victims without first hearing someone speak up for male on female violence victims 🙄🙄) Suggesting a space that is gender neutral that is separate from the other locker rooms also got me downvoted.

I used to be a libfem, my mum is a radfem, and I always thought she was transphobic and tried to tell her TiMs were “born in the wrong body”, which I now realise has no scientific basis but is a catchy saying that provokes sympathy from progressive young women like me.\n\nMy mum is also anti-porn which I also disagreed with her on, even though watching straight porn made me incredibly uncomfortable, but I was encouraged to think watching porn and getting choked and slapped is ‘cool’ by my friends. \n\nBut I hit peak trans when I saw an article about those trans girls beating all the other girls at a track meet and I remember thinking ‘Wait what? This is allowed?’ I looked into the comments for someone else to state this and the few who did were called transphobic. I thought I was losing it, how did no one else see how obviously unfair it was? How women are being erased from their own sport? How a mediocre man could transition and blow the women out of the water? I soon found the GC community and was so happy there was a whole feminist movement that didn’t include tolerating that porn positive, TRA bullshit. \n\nIt’s funny my mum recently told me she was coming around on the trans issue and I told her not to worry, that I was coming around on radical feminists instead, and she was very happy.', 'Two events (both on facebook, based on things I shared) that peaked me. \n\nI shared the tweet by Lucy Lawless that read: \n\n>In the age of [~~#~~**MeToo**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeToo?src=hash)📷\xa0  and reboots, the fact that Xena has not been revived is crazy.

And Xena should represent ALL women not just XX women!!!  \n\nMy Biggest Fuckup was when I posted an article about Angelina Jolie\'s 4-year old daughter wanting to change genders, and I listed a series of questions about whether children were just making simple associations like ""I like trucks.  Boys like trucks.

Another trans man told me that HRT had no consequences because ""if I stop taking T, I can get pregnant"" (ignoring the fact that I was talking about children who were not permitted to undergo their natural puberty).\n\nOne of my long time friends (about a 15 year friendship) took it upon herself to directly message me and tell me that I had hurt a lot of people.

He also still tells me things about womanhood he supposedly understands because he ""was a woman for five years"" and mentions how when he had huge breast implants he was treated differently, so that\'s what sexism must be like. Hes even gone as far as to say when he was taking hormones and his dick didnt work, he would get emotional, break out, and his stomach would hurt & likened and referred to that as his ""period"", while I was recovering from excision surgery for my stage IV endometriosis.

Yup.\n\nImagine being so heartless that you don't think men can empathize and support women - no, it must mean they're actually women."", 'I’ve been waiting for when I had the time to tell my peak trans story because tbh I have multiple peak trans stories… but for me it always has to go back to trans kids. I know way too many “trans kids” to be statistically probable. (I’ve already written on here about a distant relative who found my tight-knit clan on ancestry.com, joined our family reunion in Fiji, let her toddler son wear a sulu (sari/skirt) like all the other men and boys on the trip, and when he liked the cool and breathable fabric in the tropical humidity, she realised he was really a girl! And not just a regular trans girl, but an islander ‘third gender’ trans girl, even though her family is lily-white and is connected to us through ancestors of ours in Europe who never actually left for Fiji in the early 1800s… they have zero connection to, or understanding of, our island culture, ugh, ugh, ugh.)\n\nBut the ultimate in trendy trans kids stories is HipMom. I lived in Hollywood for 10 years, and my 7yo son’s original mommy group now has more trans kids than cis kids in it, not joking. If you have two kids and at least one isn’t trans, you’re just not open-minded enough! Now, I first met HipMom before either of us had kids, and we shared a mutual fandom of a certain gender non-conforming music legend (think David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Annie Lennox, Grace Jones….) She also told me how much she was hoping against hope that the baby she and her husband were trying for would be a girl. (And also trying weird things with her diet and supplements, sexual positions, timing sex at highly specific times around ovulation… look up ‘gender swinging’ or ‘ttc a girl,’ it’s a trip.)\n\nWell, baby 1 was a boy. This is Hollywood, so all her kids had ridiculous names, but baby boy 2, the same age as my son, was named for our favorite gender-bender (think Bowie/ Mercury/ Lennox. Let’s go with Mercury.) Little Mercury was all boy, which wasn’t a problem since HipMom’s husband was still down to try for that girl she wanted so badly. (In a rare moment of insight for my ex-husband, once after they’d talked to us about trying for no. 3 to finally get ‘mommy’s princess,’ my ex said “if it’s not a girl, she’s just going to make the prettiest one trans.” I’d already been thinking it, but didn’t dare say it.)\n\nThe minute baby 3 came out a boy, and HipDad felt the family was complete with three healthy kids, not-quite-3-year-old Mercury started showing up at preschool in pink shirts with a glittery purple unicorn backpack. Hipmom said she’d ‘always known’ he was really a girl. HipDad did not seem convinced, and neither were any of us who spent time with little Mercury. But luckily this only lasted about six months – and unluckily, when Mercury was suddenly allowed to be a boy again, I could only surmise one thing: HipMom was pregnant again.\n\nSadly, I was right. She told me soon after that she had deliberately “slipped one past the goalkeeper” because she would never be happy until she was a girl mom. She just knew baby 4 was a girl, but her husband had to fight her to keep to their usual low-intervention crunchy hippie pregnancy plans (I later discovered this was because she had started talking about wanting an ultrasound when previously she’d been against all that – again, Hollywood – dad was genuinely scared she’d abort a healthy baby boy to ‘try again’ if an ultrasound confirmed the fourth baby was not the girl she needed.) Well guess what? Boy no. 4! \n\nWe all helped prop mom up, she had very severe PPD. But as soon as the new baby was born, little Mercury was back in the pink shirts and glitter shoes and unicorn backpack. It took him a good year of obvious prompting from mom to start calling himself a girl, but the fix was in. My ex was right – the ‘pretty’, fair-haired one with delicate features and big blue eyes had been chosen to be her little princess, whether he wanted to be a girl or not.\n\nAt this point I left the US and only kept up with this family through Facebook. I saw every single freaking picture with the “rainbow” filter on it. I saw little Mercury get 10x the social media updates of his ‘boy’ brothers. I saw the announcement that HipMom and HipDad were divorcing, and another premonition traveled up my spine… but no, how ridiculous, surely I was just a paranoid TERF…\n\nNot even one week later, she announced that baby no. 4, not even eighteen months old, was also trans and was also “really” a girl, and would be going by a stupid name from a big-deal fantasy series (yes, that one.) This was explained as the reason for the divorce; her horrible husband just would not support the children becoming their authentic selves!\n\nSo HipMom has now transed two of her four boys, one at age three, and one at eighteen months. Her Facebook is nothing but “trans murders” and “trans suicide” and rainbow-filtered shots of her two ‘girls’ not just in girl’s clothing, but in full Disney princess garb. Her boys might as well not exist.\n\nThe saddest part? I was back in LA a couple of months ago and organized a ‘reunion’ sleepover for my son with his little friends. Mercury showed up in an Elsa dress, completely morose, and as soon as HipMom left, asked me if he could borrow some of my son’s “real boy clothes.”\n\nThis woman is a force – think head of the PTA, room mother for all of her kids, now an activist for trans kids – there’s no stopping her or challenging her without instant social death. But it remains my all-time peak trans story, and I fear for Mercury and his youngest brother as they get older – her whole life is consumed by the special identities she’s imposed on them. It’s like a weird Munchausen’s by Proxy.\n\nTL, DR: A woman I knew who was obsessed with being a “girl mom” transed two of her four sons at age three and eighteen months, despite very clear indicators that neither ‘feels like a girl’ in any way.', ""Finding this subreddit feels like I can breathe again. I started to feel really angry about the word 'cis' and suddenly I'm supposed to be ok being referred to as a 'biological woman', and pretending that having periods and a fanny and sexual harrasment from pre-teens doesn't make my experiences as a woman valid because we have to shift aside for trans women. I hate that even rational friends shut down this chat because there's no room for debate or possibly giving offence. So yes thank you for starting this subreddit, I need it."", 'It was a while ago so I don\'t remember all the details. I was your classic didn\'t spend too much time thinking about trans issues libfem - it was like, whatever I\'ll respect people\'s pronouns because it makes them happy so why not.\n\nBut then a parenting group I was in on Facebook had this one mom whose kindergarten child was transgender, and not only that but she very involved in activism about it so she kept posting about how transphobic the other parents in the kindergarten were for getting upset that she brought ""I am jazz"" to the kindergarten and read it to the kids and then had her kid explain why he was actually a girl etc etc.\n\nI thought that was pretty weird. I didn\'t understand how transgender could be a condition you\'d have in kindergarten already, kids like playing with being different, my kindergarten age niece would announce she was a father, etc. So I started googling around...\n\nI don\'t remember the exact sequence from there. I know that I discovered a lot of detransition blogs and started to be a bit horrified by what they were describing in terms of medical pressure to transition and the side effects, which I\'d had no idea of. I think searching about detransition on Tumblr led me to radblr, specifically auntiwanda.\n\nSo I started to get a lot of cognitive dissonance that what I believed was wrong. I went seeking out writing by trans people to convince myself back to my original libfem attitude but it didn\'t work... Nothing they said made half as much sense as radical feminism. I reached out to a few people to try to argue me out of my ""terf"" beliefs because I really didn\'t want to be a terf since... Yanno...terfs are evil... But their arguments were so weak and circular it didn\'t help.\n\nSo then I just gave up fighting it. I read lots and lots of radfem stuff, it really helped clarify a *lot* of things for me in basic feminism way above and beyond any trans issues.\n\nThe negative side is I\'ve become really fed up with libfem circles. I loved the website metafilter and it\'s like nails on a chalkboard, now. There will be an article about male violence and someone will promptly chime up ""please stop equating being a man with having a penis"" and there\'s a witch hunt against terfs. Thus far ive been keeping my mouth shut because I know I\'ll be instantly banned if I say anything terfy. But I think I\'m reaching a breaking point... I\'ve been slowly ""coming out"" more irl and online (it really is insane that something that, at a minimum, is a fairly basic opinion - it is impossible to change sex - is so taboo and unacceptable, wow). Some friends promptly admitted they agreed, some I fought with over it...

Naturally, another coworker (a trans man) chimes in to chide her on her use of “female” sexual organs. He made it clear that since he still has a uterus, but isn’t a woman, they’re just sexual organs. He then goes on to condescend to her that they’re “not bad words” and she should just use the terms “vagina” or “uterus”. \n\nI was absolutely floored.

How can you even be a trans man, rather than **just a man** if there’s no such thing as female or male reproductive organs? Honestly I just found it really offensive. I’m a woman and I do **not** have ambiguous sexual organs. \n\nThis shit is wild.', 'I feel like I have hit lots of little mini-peaks over the past several months. I still would not consider myself ""fully"" GC. But it still amazes me how uncritically I absorbed information put forth as fact by the transgender lobby, in an effort to be as progressive and welcoming as possible. So here\'s another mini-peak: finally coming to realize that neovaginas are NOT, and never have been, ""the same"" as actual vaginas.\n\n.\n\nBackground. I have a biology degree and work (tangentially) with the medical field, so I really should have known better. I was very interested for a long time in the process/techniques of gender-reassignment surgery. I also happen to have a history of actively hating my body, my vagina, my femininity, my vulnerability to pregnancy. So when trans rights advocates would insist that their neovagina was ""exactly the same as a cis vagina"", I just sort of accepted it. Why wouldn\'t I? Isn\'t a vagina just a fuck-hole? A vessel, with the primary function being penetration, and everything else (pregnancy, childbirth, pleasure) just secondary? I saw several pictures of neovaginas (really, neo-vulvas) that looked okay-ish from the outside and just thought, ""Well, vulvas are just kind of lumpy and individualistic anyway...even if ***I*** think they\'re weird-looking, plenty of other vaginas don\'t look \'perfect\' so why would these?"" So previously, I had believed that, ""Of course if a person doesn\'t want to date a pre-op/non-op MtF person, that\'s their right to avoid penis if they don\'t want it, but once they have surgery, *it would be bigoted to refuse because* ***a neovagina is the same as a regular vagina, of course.***"" (Ugh. It hurts just to type that.)\n\n.\n\nThere\'s a myth that a neovagina\'s bacterial flora will eventually start to resemble that of a real vagina\'s (it won\'t), and that recycled scrotal skin will eventually epithelialize on its own to become more similar to the internal walls of an actual vagina (it doesn\'t). These ""facts"" are frequently paraded throughout trans communities online, and I just ate them up. ""Wow, isn\'t the human body amazing? **Look how it totally changes with the right hormones, a scalpel, and a can-do attitude!""**\n\n.\n\nThen I saw pictures and read stories of post-op complications. About suspicious discharge, hypergranulation tissue, post-op neuromas, horrible chronic pain, internal hair growth, prolapse, bleeding, infection, the need for constant revision surgeries, loss of ability to orgasm. And really, what first ""peaked"" me in this regard (apologies for being graphic) was the thought of someone\'s partner feeling societally pressured to have oral sex with an artificial orifice filled with strange bacteria and malodorous discharge. ""*You don\'t want to be a bigot, do you?* ***Because a neovagina is the same as a regular vagina, of course***.""\n\n\n.\n\n\n**No.** It\'s not. Even in those surgeries with ""good"" outcomes, it\'s still not the same. And it should be a partner\'s right to know that in advance, regardless of ""how realistic it looks"". How is that even controversial?\n\n.\n\nAnd finally, it was also terrible to read the stories of these transwomen who had gone through all of this money, pain, time, and effort, to achieve something that ultimately brought them more suffering than it did healing. **Gender dysphoria fucking sucks.** I can\'t imagine how desperate one must be, in order to consider such barbaric surgeries the solution to their distress. And the thought of one of these transwomen, full of hope, longing, and wishes for a brighter future, going under the knife and coming out on the other side full of horrible pain... it\'s utterly awful. I feel horrible for them. And it frustrates me to no end that their own community has tried to push surgery as the ultimate ""fix"", and when complications are brought up, this is all waved away in order to preserve this fantasy.\n\n.\n\nSo that\'s where I\'m at. Neovaginas aren\'t real vaginas. Pretending otherwise is illogical in the best-case scenario, and cruel and dangerous in the worst.', ""I'm new here, but I just need to vent so here it goes. I grew up in the 1960s when women had few rights and by 4 years old I was a radical feminist. I fought against the discrimination that was ingrained in the legal system that allowed my brother freedoms and rights that were denied to me because of my sex. In the 1970s women were finally winning legal rights to be treated as fully autonomous human beings and I thought my days of fighting against the patriarchy were soon to be over. I got on with living my life and doing things that my mother and grandmother had never been allowed to do in their days. \n\nAfter a lifetime of hard physical labour I finally retired from work 3 years ago and became absorbed in my new country life without reading newspapers, watching TV, or touching a computer. I deliberately cut myself off from the world and had been very happy living in my rural bubble unaware of what was going on in society. That bubble burst in February. I went online to read my local independent newspaper and there was a story on self-ID and changing sex on birth certificates. My state had become transgender aware and the politicians had taken the sex-based rights I had fought tooth and nail for and had given them to any man who asked for them. Suddenly, women had penises, men were women, lesbians didn't exist, and children were being told they were in the wrong bodies. I had only looked away for 3 years yet when I turned around it seemed like the world had lost the plot. \n\nHow could this bullshit happen in such a short time? Who are these progressive left feminists who think that feminism means putting men in dresses first? Why is everybody falling over themselves to go along with this mass delusion that males can be females and that biological facts, and reality itself, do not exist? I have been reading up on this trans takeover and it is bullshit. I can't believe how this cult has managed to become so powerful in such a short amount of time. I see people being punished for questioning trans-ideology and losing their jobs for having an opinion. Luckily, I have no job, no boss, no children, and no public profile to be threatened  if I speak out, but I am seeing several formerly outspoken people silenced by the trans-lobby with threats to their careers and reputations. I am bloody outraged at the women I fought so hard to give sex-based rights to that have given those rights away to men. I should not have to fight for my rights all over again in my old age.  End of rant."", '[deleted]', 'TIM co-worker\n\nThe sad thing is that this person wasn\'t initially despised for being trans (even though it was quite noticeable, he had sort of a neckbeard tbh). He just had a reputation for being lazy and walking out in the middle of shifts. One thing that always rubbed me the wrong way,though, was the fact that he would always touch mine and other womens arms when talking to us. Like not even in a friendly way, he\'d just put his palm flat against our arms for some reason. That\'s genuinely something I\'ve never seen anybody do before. Another thing was the fact that whenever he was bailing on his job he only ever asked women to cover his spot.\n\nAnyway, after about 2 and a half weeks of working there he starts complaining about being sick and tired every day and wanting to go home. One night he seems to be trying especially hard to leave. This would have been his 3rd night in a row that he went home due to being sick so I advised him against it since I thought he would get fired. He demands a chair to sit down and we give him one with no problem. A couple hours pass and he realizes his complaints are getting him nowhere so he finally walks up to me and says ""I need to go home, I have cramps."" Yeah... as in literally period cramps. ""My entire down-there region is aching. I need to leave.""  I really tried to keep a straight face and told him I\'d see what I would do.\n\nI told the woman running the shift this and she offerd to get him some midol (he declined) and they sent him home. He\'s the only person at that store whose ever been allowed to leave due to period cramps. This employee quit the very next day due to not being allowed to sit in the break room and eat while on the clock. He demanded we give him his money back for the expensive work shoes he ordered through the company catalog a couple days prior that he never got to use.\n\nAfter he left the whole debacle basically just turned into a running joke. Male employees still jokingly ask to leave do to cramps or morning sickness. The more I think about it, though, the more angry I get. I have cramps so severe that I\'ve been working my shift, leaning against tables and trying to fight back tears and they never let me so much as sit down. Most women aren\'t allowed to use ""cramps"" as an excuse to miss work. There are also 2 pregnant women on our shift who aren\'t given chairs to sit down and aren\'t allowed to leave early. Needless to say they are as angry about it as I am. I just feel like this person gets to benefit from our female-specific suffering. Like, ""you\'re welcome I go through so much pain every month so you can have an excuse to leave me with extra work."" And the attitude that went with it just adds to it. It\'s almost like he thought that he could just play the ""woman-card"" and get whatever he wanted. Even worse is that it actually worked, but only because he\'s not an actual woman.

I wanted to find more content like that so I got into reading Germaine Greer and Andrea Dworkin. \n\nI told my best friend (female friendship of SIX YEARS) about these things and about Germaine and her ideas about lowering the sentence for rape etc. and my best friend was like “I think I don’t like Germaine Greer but I don’t remember why” \n\nSo a week passes and then she sends me CONTRAPOINTS’ video on “gender critical feminists” and says “this is why I fucking hate Germaine Greer this is the most vile disgusting thing I’ve ever seen” in reference to a cherry picked quote that contrapoints used in his video where Germaine said that she didn’t write her book the female eunuch for “transwomen” and that it does less than nothing for them......which is true\n\nSo I’m like....well I think it was pretty misogynist for contrapoints to mockingly make fun of not only Germaine but also SYLVIA PLATH...a woman who fucking killed herself. and my best friend literally told me that I’m “hateful and naive” and “beyond reasoning” and she blocked me!!! my best friend of six years who I talked to every single day broke up with me over the trans cult shit...when I wasnt even being like conclusive about my radical feminism at that point. I just pointed out I didn’t like how he spoke about these notable literary women in his video!! \n\nanyway so that spurred me to find the radical feminist community online and I came across leah tverly and Terri Strange and many others on YouTube and I realized how fucking psychotic it all is\n\nI had another conversation with my best friend before she blocked me again and I told her how contrapoints is a aggressive autogynephile who harassed terri strange by sending her violent porn and she just responded by going “k” and blocking me again :/\n\nI also posted a video of youtuber cari Stella talking about her detransition and several of my online friends contacted me and called me a terf and contacted mutual friends to tell them how disgusting I was. Over literally just posting a video of a woman talking about her experience....one of these was a gay man who “identifies as non binary” and he of course couldn’t respond to any of my points when I brought up women’s safety and the instances of TiM mma fighter Fallon Fox giving his female opponent a concussion and breaking her skull, or Karen white the TiM inmate in the UK who got sent to a women’s prison and then proceeded to rape several of the female inmates he had access to. This guy told me I was “pushing a personal agenda” and that I “need help” which is a typical male behavior of accusing me of female hysteria LOL so annoying \n\nalso all the “trans” people I’ve met irl are socially inept, total assholes, or clearly are in need of therapy OBVIOUSLY. I always knew deep down that the libfem shit was stupid. I never understood how it was problematic to call a male person....male.....like how do they even say that shit lmfao. Peak transing also helped me get access to analysis of pornography and prostitution which I’ve also always been suspicious about but tried to justify it since libfems are all about sex positivity. so many girls my age (22) are prostituting themselves on apps and I think that’s deeply disturbing and wrong but of course to libfems it’s “empowering”', 'I didn\'t have a problem towards trans people, until I started reading some post written by trans people about how they realized they were trans, and I found the reasons SO stupid, embedded on traditional gender roles that I saw as regresive that I couldn\'t believe it. At that point, still I was cool with in since I\'m on the opinion that an individual can do whatever they chose with their body and life.\n\nBut after a while I started seeing than in any post, piece of news or article about something regarding to women there were always very rude an aggresive transwomen with this ""and what about transwomen???"" claim.\n\nThe last straw was finding this shit about trans women claiming that lesbians should accept them since they feel like women. \n\nLately I\'m following some feminists from my country on twitter, and seing the average shit they are dealing with (and that\'s taking into account that things are as bad here regarding that topic as in the USA) made me peak completely.', ""Lavern Cox coming out to say it's black women's fault that black men are not attracted or open to trans women, causing violence  and that we need to educate them. \n\nYet again black women are to blame. Black trans women have been going extra hard with the gaslighting and entitlement towards us. I'm all the way done."", ' A while back, I wrote my peak trans moments, but realised I actually peaked a lot earlier. I used to use Tumblr a lot; this was 4 or 5 years ago now. I was part of a fandom in which there are a lot of LGBT and one girl aged 13, who started off as a bisexual tomboy, suddenly decided she was trans. She demanded we all start calling her Alex, and people complied without question. Well “Alex” soon had a severe mental health decline, displaying signs of psychosis (claims of hallucinations), delusions of grandeur as if she’d transcended into a superior being, constant suicide threats, demanding people put trigger warnings on all posts, turning from friendly and sweet to the source of all the drama in the community. I tried to help as much as I could, despite being the other side of the Atlantic, feeling it was my duty as one of the grown adults in the fandom, as I’d felt like I couldn’t relate to other females at her age too. I told her not to pursue transitioning until she knows who she really is, because at 13, you simply haven’t figured out who you are yet, because puberty is a confusing time and that she’s going to be alright, but it was met with more hysteria and accusations of me patronising her. It was so sad to see what had been an intelligent and witty kid turn into a complete hysterical wreck soon after joining the gender cult.  \n\nHer parents banned her from the internet twice but she found ways of sneaking back. Eventually, she disappeared for three weeks – they’d had her admitted to hospital and she’d been sectioned. She came out a lot more stable, but still going by “Alex”. However, she started talking to the trans kids again and was sucked back down into the trans whirlpool and wound up back in hospital. It showed me that Tumblr Trans are fuelling each other’s dysphoria and dysmorphia. If one is having a nice self-accepting day, and feels ‘cured’, they’ll soon be pulled right back down into it, by the “resist cis brainwashing” blue-haired soft-bois crew. It was pure self-obsession. They talk about people dehumanising and ‘othering’ them, but they were segregating themselves as ""protection"", despite most people complying with their demands. \n\nAfter spending a month away, she returned, announced she was a girl, she was now using her birth name and female pronouns, that Tumblr is a hive of trans cult and censoring free speech and we had our funny, witty tomboy girl back. She was completely normal again and shortly after quit the “unhealthy” website for good, began learning to play in a marching band and she got into art. She even acted repulsed by the whole ‘soft trans boi’ girls and mocked them. I’m so relieved she didn’t end up having a double mastectomy and hormone treatment and I’m glad her parents got her sectioned and that her doctors didn’t pander to this whole “she must go to a gender clinic” nonsense.', 'I recall the exact moment that I peaked. \n\nI was in a FB group called ""Raising your daughter to be a feminist"" or something like that. \n\nAt first, most of the content was pretty good. But then it all started centering around trans activism. \n\nOne woman wrote a very sincere post asking advice. She said that in her workplace, there is a TIM, who, before telling everyone that he was now a woman and starting to transition, was totally sexist, made horrible, misogynistic comments to his coworkers, men and women both, and was, in general, an all around jerk. \n\nNow that he decided he was a woman, he started using the woman\'s locker room at work - changing, showering, etc. She also mentioned that he quite obviously hadn\'t had bottom surgery.   \nA lot of the women felt very uncomfortable about this, especially considering what a sexist pig he was, and well, because he clearly had a penis. \n\nShe was asking how to handle the situation. \n\nThe comments turned into a clusterf\\*\\*\\*, mostly attacking her. The worst was one of the mods, who is a TiM. \n\nThey told her that this guy was ALWAYS a woman, and that some women can be jerks as well, but it\'s not a reason for them to not be allowed to use the women\'s locker room. \n\nThey told her that this butthead may have been acting out of internalized sexism, since he was always a woman, and that was his way of dealing. \n\nThey said she was a TERF because she referred to the guy as a ""he"" before he transitioned. \n\nThey said that women didn\'t only have vaginas. That he is a woman, therefore every part of his body is a woman\'s.\n\nI honestly couldn\'t believe it. I think that because I don\'t live in the US or Europe, I assumed that stuff like this was exaggerated. \n\nThe worst part was the OP couldn\'t apologize enough. She was so sorry to have offended, she\'s just trying to learn, thanks to all the commenters for helping to put her straight. \n\nI thought - how is this space, a space for feminists, a space for women, being used to abuse and heap shame and guilt on some poor woman who was posting about having to allow a disgusting, sexist pig of a man into the women\'s locker room? Complete erasure of women\'s rights and total shaming to boot. \n\nI wrote a nasty comment that this was the biggest load of bullshit that I\'ve ever seen, and I left the group.\n\nThen I found GC and realized that I\'m not alone. Thank you all.', ""I am so grateful I found this sub. I'm a student in the medical field, and my own experiences along with my education have drastically changed my opinion. \n\nI'm a straight woman. I have identified as a feminist since my teens, and certainly have never identified as a conservative. \n\nHere is the turning point that led to peaking: I had a part-time job a few years ago. An ex-military man who decided to start identifying as a woman started to message me via social media. I pulled together that he knew a co-worker of mine at the part-time job. That's it. His only connection to me was seeing me online as a mutual friend of my co-worker. He started messaging me frequently using language that seemed to pantomime that of a ditzy woman in a movie. Calling me honey, babe, doll, etc. I thought this person was just rather lonely, perhaps on the spectrum, and I didn't really mind their minor presence. At first. \n\nHe then asked me to get coffee or drinks. The compliments turned into declarations. He said He wanted to look like me as a woman, to wear the sort of clothes I wear and style his hair like I do. I was supportive, but I also did not understand why he wanted to meet me. I did not respond in a particularly engaging way to him, and our degrees of separation were so flimsy that I did not understand why he insisted we get our nails done or go shopping. As a student, I do my nails at home, if at all, and there's not even much time or money for shopping. Plus, I was starting to get uncomfortable with his fixation on me. I did not want to seem bigoted or mean, but I just felt something was off about this person.\n\nAfter a few weeks of not responding to his requests to do stereotypically girly things, he messaged again. He said he wanted to beat up conservatives and TERFS.  His basic training means the physical harm he would cause would be considered assaults with a deadly weapon. He described how satisfying it would be to punch women and conservatives with glee, adding a lol at the end. I blocked him after that. I heard the message loud and clear.  \n\nIncidentally, this was the first time I heard the term TERF. I thought it related to a misspelling of accusing women of wanting to defend their turf. \n\nI've been feeling guilty about this for many months. I have been sexually assaulted numerous times in my life, including this past weekend. Men truly feel they deserve access to women's bodies and spaces and experiences -- even victimhood -- in ways that frighten me. They will never know what it's like to be looked at sexually by a man at 10 because your breasts are developing a little too early. They will never know what it's like to go through painful fertility treatments. They will never understand the basic mechanisms of the body and the socialization of a growing girl and yet they  demand we identity them as one.

She apologised for her lie about being trans but said she didn't know how else to play it.

However, I was convinced to respect pronouns or men in our bathrooms etc because ""it doesn\'t cost you anything to \'be nice\'"" (the fact that that type of reasoning is 1000% aimed at women is something else that annoys me). \n\nMy peak trans moment came about as a result of some major drama in a friend group that I was peripherally attached to. There was a couple (heterosexual) that dated for about two years within that group. A few months after they broke up, the woman posted a long facebook note about how the relationship was super abusive and he coerced her into sex many times (including making her lose her virginity before she was ready) by threatening her physically, financially, and emotionally. The post was really long and descriptive and horrifying and I remember feeling sick to my stomach reading it. Immediately that entire friend group posted messages in support. About 2 days later the man from the relationship posted that he identified as a trans woman and this was his coming out post and that he had ""committed some mistakes in his past while struggling with coming to terms with his gender identity."" Immediately, their entire mutual friend group rushed to support him and fall over themselves to ask for forgiveness for condemning him earlier because they didn\'t know his struggles. \n\nNow, this woman and I did not have a very friendly relationship because we had had to share an apartment for a short time and really did not get along as roommates. However, I was so horrified by the way all her supposed friends were so quick to forgive her rapist/abuser just because he was a ""trans woman"" that I felt compelled to reach out to her and she told me that pretty much all those friends told her that if she didn\'t stop mentioning the abuse she was being transphobic. I think my brain exploded from hearing about that and the rest is history. Turns out that of the 6 TIMs I have met/have transitioned since then, all 6 of them are major creeps who constantly push women\'s boundaries to the extreme and each one serves to confirm my opinion. They\'re all miraculously ""lesbians"" of course.', '&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** please do not screen-cap this or re-post it elsewhere. I\'m posting from a secondary account for a reason. I understand the amount of criticism and backlash I might face if someone where to figure out who I am irl, and I do not want this spread beyond this community. I\'m thankful to have this space to share my thoughts; please, do not jeopardize that.\n\nI want to make it clear that I do not harbor any ill will or hate towards trans-identifying individuals. I believe everyone deserves respect, care, and decency no matter their identity and I understand that dysphoria is a deeply distressing experience that causes extreme pain to many people. I can empathize with the experience of feeling disconnected from one\'s own body and I know, to some extent, how painful that can be. I wish the very best to anyone struggling with their gender and/or identity and that is a sentiment I feel above all others mentioned here.\n\n**Now that that\'s out of the way, here\'s my story.**\n\nSo, by April of this year, I\'d been browsing some GC blogs and I knew a little bit about GC feminist theory...and I found myself on the fence about most of it.\n\nDuring the month of April, my college announced that there\'d be an event held at the art museum on campus. The event would be entitled ""Women"". That\'s it. I was curious and eager to go and see what the event would be like.\n\nSo, I arrived to the art museum at the specified date and time, and got ready to have a good conversation with other women. I went into the seating area, and took a seat.\n\nStanding at the podium was a (clearly) biological male. I\'ll admit, my heart dropped a little, but I thought I\'d give it a chance. Maybe there was something I could learn, some positive experience I could have here. After all, I don\'t think it is right to discount someone\'s experience on the basis of their identity. Originally, I have come there to have a discussion with other women about the experience of womanhood, but I figured that could always happen later. Why not see what this individual had to say?\n\nI didn\'t know who Andrea Long Chu was at the time, because I\'m not one to get caught up in discourse and twitter arguments. But, by the end of the talk I attended, I had formed a pretty unshakable opinion of them: they had no idea what they were talking about.\n\nI took the liberty of jotting down some quotes from the talk while I was there. I should be pretty clear why many of these came off as problematic to me:\n\n1. Feminists don\'t want to be female\n2. Everyone is female and everyone hates it\n3. Becoming subject to beauty standards IS female\n4. To be female is to be an object\n5. Gender is something people have to give you\n6. The asshole - a universal vagina through which femaleness is experienced\n7. Fuck is what a female is; being fucked makes you female\n\nI didn\'t just find these claims impossible, I found them deeply degrading. Not only that; I found them cowardly. Because I think Andrea Long Chu knew these claims were offensive and degrading. Many times throughout the talk they tried to deflect criticism by saying stuff like ""I\'m trying to be provocative. I\'m trying to take the most extreme stances possible"". Thankfully, during the question section afterwards, an older women who\'d been paying attention caught onto this and asked ""If you\'re only trying to be provocative, what\'s the point? What do you really believe? What are you really de-constructing?"" I was so glad this woman was sharp enough to realize what games Andrea was trying to play and held her accountable - and I imagine she did so because, at her age, she\'d seen a lot of actual oppression of women in her time.\n\nNow, Andrea didn\'t have an immediate answer to this, and responded by looking like a deer in the headlights for a moment. Then, sheepishly, they said:\n\n""Well...I mean...just because I acknowledge they\'re extreme doesn\'t mean I don\'t believe these things"". Here, they essentially admitted to the fact that they did believe these outrageous things, and were trying to deflect accountability earlier.\n\nI stayed for most of the talk, but I did leave at one point - during the monologue about sissy porn - because I was just so fed up. I returned, but the talk was just about over anyways. I\'ll admit, the whole thing really shook me and made me feel pretty shitty. Afterwards I went to a good friend (who happens to be male) and talked to them about the experience. They were very understanding and admitted they also thought the statements made had been offensive. Briefly, I found myself thinking: this cis man understands more of what it\'s like to be a woman than whoever it was standing at that podium dressed as one.\n\nThe whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, but it also left me feeling vindicated. I used to feel constant guilt for questioning trans rhetoric but after that event, I felt it was only natural.\n\nI will end by answering this central question, which will no doubt be raised anyways:\n\nDo I believe Andrea Long Chu is a woman? Well, the answer to that is complicated. You see, **I do not believe I can grant, deny, or assign the title of ""woman"" to Andrea Long Chu. Because, unlike them, I do not believe the status of ""woman"" can be granted, denied, or assigned in the first place.** We disagree on this fundamental matter. If you were to ask ALC, they\'d probably accuse me of denying them their womanhood - however, I never mean to do such a thing, because I don\'t think that\'s even possible.', ' [https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/kinks-fetishes-place-pride/#gs.ipti6x](https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/kinks-fetishes-place-pride/#gs.ipti6x) \n\nPeak queer.

Weakly apologizes the next day with no real explanation or remorse for behavior. Has inserted himself into the women’s group at work without any prior consent and the women respond with open arms publicly when I know in private there’s discomfort. TIM has also brought other fetishistic behaviors into work that have raised eyebrows. Complains about having to use the GN restrooms. Constantly tries to draw attention to himself when in women’s clothes or other feminine accessories. A lot of the TIM’s behaviors feel disingenuous and attention seeking. I know other TIMs that don’t exhibit any of these behaviors.', ""I am new to the broader online community of openly gender critical women. Firstly I want to thank all the brave souls who are speaking out and organising despite the rising hostility against those that have the audacity to be biological women and refuse to apologise for it. \n\nI am a lesbian of mixed middle eastern (ex-muslim) heritage and grew up in a supposedly lesbian-friendly city. While my disillusionment with the broader ‘lgbtqia+??’’community’ was mounting due to the queering and nullifying of overt lesbianism and the word lesbian itself becoming a signifier of a lack of ‘woke’ status and transphobia; I didn't reach peak trans until I joined an lgbt mental health ‘women’s group’ and was confronted with just how deep the rot has set in. I was one of two biological women in a group of seven. The toilets at the meeting place were labelled for Men and All Genders, women were out of luck if they wanted some privacy. Each week involved rants against ‘cis’ people, complaints about side effects of hormone treatment, how make up defined their femininity (with make up tips) and one TIM group member made inappropriate advances towards me that made me extremely uncomfortable in a supposedly safe and supportive setting which despite happening blatantly in front of the facilitator received no comment. My discomfort was seen as transphobia by the TIM in question. In short there was no space for me; one of two actual women in the women's group to speak freely or at all.\n\nThe resentment, bitterness and rage towards ‘cis-scum’ struck me as indistinguishable from manifestoes of inceldom and religious fundamentalism that see women as property at best. I can’t stand idly by any longer while TRAs undermine, belittle and actively harm women and harm efforts to end sex based oppression which being privy to the struggles of women in Iran and Iraq (my ethnic background) and the world at large is nothing less than abhorrent."", 'THANK YOU FOR THIS BOUNTY. I read the entire sub over the past several days in a fevered state, like I had discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls. I even signed up for reddit just to post this.

I always supported LGB rights. Trans was something that passed me by until a few things: Jenner as Woman of the Year, Rose McGowan getting attacked, people listing their preferred pronouns in their email signatures. The bathroom/changing room stories and the transwomen competing in women’s sports gave me a WTF reaction but I thought I was the only one who thought this way. A few weeks ago on NPR hearing a guest insist that  ""Trans women are women."" I was like, no. You can express yourself how you like but no. The guest went unchallenged as the host tied himself in knots. Hearing about the hormones and surgery on kids and young adults just made me lie down in despair. And then I nearly lost my mind when reading about the cotton ceiling. Only someone with intact, fully functional ballz would come up with that concept.\n\nI reached peak trans in an IRL conversation with a friend about the rape scandals in our church.  She’s a professor in a liberal arts discipline and she told me that the Terf/Trans thing is roiling her field. We got to talking about men using clerical dress or these days a skirt and heels as cover in order to invade spaces intended for women or children. Men have been doing this shit forever, just using different tactics and always blaming the victims.\n\nI am the product of all-girls schools and was educated by a bunch of radical feminist nuns. They might not call themselves that, but they were. The head of the religious order, all the faculty and administration were women, and they emphasized academic and athletic achievement, character, and pre SJW-type social justice. The RCC is the definition of patriarchy but in my lived experience, my K-12 education was the only place where women were in charge and afforded respect. Largely because of this upbringing, I\'m not ""game."" I don\'t know how to read men and don\'t defer to them. I didn\'t realize that not yielding to men in meetings or in conversation was a no-no. I refused to, and would not even know how to, play expected female roles of fawning girl or mom to the men I worked with. Raise your hand with me if you’ve been called abrasive in a performance review or told to smile more.\n\nI was lucky. As a kid I had a supportive environment and none of the men in my life abused me. Does it mean they haven’t abused anybody? No, sadly, given the sheer volume of stories out there. But even with an unusual amount of support, I absorbed and internalized misogyny. I hated my body. Hated it!  I would pray to never develop. I hid my period from my mom for as long as possible. I would bind my breasts with an ace bandage, trying to flatten myself or at least immobilize them. DIY binding, 1980s style. Looking back, I was trying to escape womanhood. I could see what it meant and I didn\'t like it. I knew instinctively, before reading a word of radical feminist text, that based on my sex I\'d be subject to a whole raft of shit that I did not want.  If I did that today, would I have been considered trans?\n\nI get what motivates some girls/women not to want to be identified as girls/women. But it doesn\'t change their sex.  And transwomen are not women. Their idea of girlhood/womanhood is laughable. In my life girlhood/womanhood has meant this:  police the shit out of yourself. This encompasses how you sit, how you walk, how you comport yourself. Protect your reputation. Always be conscious of your body.  It can even encompass our experience of physical pain and how doctors treat us--police yourself, don\'t complain. Never ever let your guard down. If you fail, whatever happens is on you.\n\nThat is what the trans activists want: to have access to women and girls when their guard is down. That is some rapey shit right there. I am astounded at how trans activism has surpassed, in such a short time period, so many other causes that struggle for visibility, legislation, funding, etc.  Whoever is funding the trans rights movement is having a laugh watching people suffer.\n\nedited: typos\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver, stranger!', 'Hi everyone, again.

It’s so fucking vile. If I needed anymore assurance as to why I will never support TIMs/trans rights again, today really really solidified that. This is fucking vile.

It was so frustrating and demoralizing to get to the starting line next to her and already know the outcome of the race.  (My coach said I was still gaining on her to the end tho!)  But then afterwards too, people at my work knew I had a race, and when they ask me how it went and what do I say, ""I got second, but its because the person who got first is trans ..."" ...?  It sucks!  But also she\'s such a silly person -- and now everyone tells her how gorgeous she is and how great she looks etc. etc.  She asked me once about how one does bench pulls with boobs ... lol well I actually don\'t have any boobs (A cups yippee) to get in the way! so they\'ve never been a problem for me!', 'This is my 3rd peak but I still think it’s worth telling.\n\nRecently, a friend of mine was telling me about one of her ancestors. This ancestor faked her own death and then went to live as a man with their girlfriend/wife. She later had to pay hush money to her family who found out that she was alive. \n\nMy friend is absolutely convinced that the reason that she did this was because she was trans and wanted to live her life as a man (which, tbf, is reasonable given the awful conditions that women lived in historically). My friend is so insistent on this that she used ‘he/him’ pronouns to refer to this women and says that her family couldn’t understand why she’d done this because they were ‘cis people’. My friend thinks that the hush money was paid so that people would be aware of her being trans but keep quiet about it. \n\nBut I’m not so convinced of this story. I think this woman lived as a man publicly in order to hide the fact that she was actually a lesbian and was married to a woman. I think she faked her own death so no one would think about tracking her down and so that she could start a new life with her girlfriend/wife. And I think that she payed the hush money because so much of her life (dressing/acting like a man and being married to a woman) was illegal and both of them could be sent to prison or an asylum if they were ever caught. \n\nI think then I realised how much being trans is the centre of their life to the point that they can’t even consider something like this to be completely unrelated to being trans. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened; women who dressed up as men in order to benefit from male privilege (including having access to an education) have been labelled as trans or gender fluid.

I work for a liberal tech company, and our old self-formed group for women programmers got renamed by popular vote to be a group for ""oppressed gender identities.""

Until then I had really believed TWAW, but leaving that conversation I realized it was exactly like talking to a cranky senior male programmer who didn\'t listen to a thing I said. At that point I realized the TRA argument that ""trans women didn\'t experience male socialization because inside they were always women"" was a lie.\n\nAnd recently I\'ve done thorough research and decided that gender identity is bullshit.

Nope, sorry, a dick in a dress makes my vagina dry. Next. \n\nSo I’m here, and angry.', 'I never entirely understood the whole trans thing, but as a lesbian I used to think we\'re part of the same community and should support each other.

I just took it to mean they were ""born in the wrong bodies"", because that\'s what I\'d heard over and over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wasn\'t just these two, though. People I know, some very casually and some a little better, kept coming out as trans. Eventually it occurred to me that it\'s a little weird that I know this many trans people, all of whom I\'d met in places and situations in no way related to transness or ""queerness"". Like how many can there be? The thing that really bothered me, though, wasn\'t the amount but the similarities. All of these people were female, around the same age, had previously identified as something other than straight, had nerdy hobbies and interests and had low self-esteem. Several of them fetishised gay men (and what do you know, after starting to identify as men were suddenly ""gay men"" themselves). I kept my mouth shut, but I started to question things a little.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat drove me over the edge was experiencing the open hostility \\~woke\\~ trans activists have towards lesbians and the massive hypocrisy regarding how people are expected to treat trans people and trans issues. Men can be criticised, but there\'s no special word for men who aren\'t woke enough on trans matters. Meanwhile terf is thrown around at the drop of a hat if a woman dares step out of line. At the same time trans activists post memes about beating up and killing terfs, just to make it clear how much they hate women who disagree with them. I\'ve seen stuff about wanting to rape terfs and other such lovely content receive nothing but support. That\'s fucking disgusting and horribly misogynistic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, as a lesbian I got tired of being expected to be sexually available to biological males, even if they still have male genitalia. I\'ve seen this kind of shit directed towards gay men a couple of times, but it gets criticised heavily, including by people who aren\'t gay men themselves. Not so for us. If someone knows I\'m a lesbian, there\'s no way I should have to explain to that person why I don\'t want to suck dick. AND YET. The prevalence of rapey cotton ceiling shit along with all the other ridiculous demands on lesbians (we\'re on thin ice before we\'ve even said anything because we\'re probably one of those horrible terfs anyway) make ""queer"" spaces fucking unbearable. I had a hard time dealing with the fact that I\'m a lesbian, and now I have to deal with this shit from people I thought were on my side and part of the same community.

And I just thought to myself, ""Of course OP was including trans men and female NBs, they\'re biologically female and have periods, and they know that."" The OP didn\'t have to specifically say ""everyone who has periods"" to be inclusive, because everyone who was female was automatically included, right?\n\nBut I realized that wasn\'t the problem at hand.... the OP was implying that all ""menstruators"" were women and that was the problem. The trans men and NBs in question were mad that they were being addressed and referred to as female. And that\'s when I peaked. Why the hell are these people trying so hard to deny that they are biologically female? You\'re having periods because you have a functioning female reproductive system, and that\'s because you **are** female! Many of you are (young) adult human females, aka WOMEN! And there shouldn\'t be anything wrong with that! It was honestly depressing to see.\n\nAlso I just hate the bending of language (and the reality that comes with it). Vaginas shouldn\'t be referred to as ""front holes"". No, men do not get periods. Not some men, not any men. Adult human males will never menstruate.

It\'s taken months for me to gain clear vision.\n\n1. Background: I have recently been sorting through years of trauma I accumulated as a woman and as a black person. This has led me to see more clearly how people occupy different ""worlds"" depending on the groups we belong to\n2. For example, the men in my life cannot empathize with my pain and outrage over sexism. In fact, they can barely SEE misogyny and its prevalence. I have to have other women in my life for that, and the implicit understanding is there. If the men do catch a whiff of misogyny, they still do not react with in-their-bones outrage to blatant injustice and abuse of women. They can learn cognitive empathy, with time and hard work. But they will continue to lack the experience of being a woman and can only see the world through their perspective as men (it\'s not an insult, just reality).\n3. Ditto to my white family and friends being all but blind to racism and white supremacy and the deep pain it causes, so I need to interact with non-white, especially other black people for perspective and reprieve from that\n4. Seeing these distinctions more clearly made me catch the social justice bug in an even stronger way. I wanted to be more aware of my *own* blind spots and areas of privilege too, in order to understand and support other marginalized people\n5. Plus, I caught myself thinking the ""transphobic"" thought in point #2 about noticing...well...that men are not women and have a certain ""male-pattern blindness."" When I realized this contradicted the message of trans people, I quickly covered the thought up out of respect. I quickly decided transwomen are the exception to men not being women, or rather, I just stopped thinking about it. I didn\'t want to venture where my cis-privileged self didn\'t belong\n6. I later found GC by researching unrelated topics on feminism. This place is CONFUSING at first. I had trouble comprehending wtf I had stumbled upon. On the one hand, the radical feminism in here gave me LIFE. Sanity at last! On the other hand, are we seriously trashing trans people here?! We have to accept and protect these people! I had never critically examined trans ideology and doing so actually felt immoral and abhorrent at first.\n7. I remained confused for a long time, but checked in occasionally for the radical feminism. My first mini-peak was when I tried to expand my understanding of non-binary people. I was like, ""I\'ll get the information unadulterated, straight from their own mouths!"" Well, that backfired. They were either describing pretty much everyone. Or reinforcing stereotypes (""I\'m a girl when I present like this, but a boy when I present like that""). Whatever, I\'m super live and let live. Logically, I could no longer agree with it. But shhhhhhh.\n8. Then, through GC, I found other subs where I ended up reading stories from disillusioned trans people. I myself have lost years of my life to cultic groups and brainwashing, so I knew what I was looking at when I read their stories. For the first time, I saw that this celebrated, ""progressive\' movement was actually harming and indoctrinating some, if not many--harming its own members. It angered me so much. That was my first \\*record-scratch\\* peak.\n9. I also started to pick this apart in other ways, realizing that demands were being made of women, but I questioned if transwomen actually empathized with--or even *cared* about--women as a group, despite their claim to womanhood. (Spoiler alert: they don\'t). Hmm, it\'s a lot like how men don\'t care about misogyny.\n10. Further, I saw that this movement is extremely individualistic--\\*I\\* want, what makes \\*me\\* comfortable, \\*my\\* feelings, \\*my\\* truth, \\*my\\* journey, \\*my\\* validity (\\*my\\* balls). There is no unity with, alliance with, or empathizing with women. We do not matter. They do.\n11. And then I started to understand GC. WTF, changing sex IS impossible. Men do not lose their male socialization. There is no ""woman feeling"" or ""woman essence""!!! The fetish and occasional overlapping pedo aspects (PEAK PEAK PEAK!). *""It\'s M\'AM!""* The indoctrination of and experimentation on *children* in the name ideology. Regressive stereotypes, misogyny, homophobia, porn-sickness, sissy hypno bullshit. Trans billionaires with the financial clout to push this into mainstream acceptance. 4,000% increase in female children in the UK! Cotton ceiling. Self ID. Women raped in prisons. The sick, surreal joke of taking immigrant women to human rights court to compel them to WAX BALLS cause the pedophile says he\'s a lady. There\'s too much to list. Fucking madness.\n\nThis is the darkest timeline. In my opinion, if you care about people, kids, women, society, free speech, sanity... you cannot support this regressive ideology.', 'A bit over a year ago, a longtime friend came out as trans. Like a good liberal woman, I showed immediate support, used the preferred pronouns of she/her, and the new name. I had been fully into the whole TWAW thing, agreed that feminism that didn\'t accept TIMs as women was wrong, engaged in the mental gymnastics needed to accept that a TIM experience of being raised as a man was also valid as a variation of a woman\'s experience, all of it.\n\nSince that time, my partner, a GNC man who studies and teaches sociology with an emphasis on gender and who had tried transitioning to living as a woman back in his mid-20s before abandoning that path after about a year, started planting the seeds of what I now recognize as radfem thinking. He has been very subtle and diplomatic, approaching it in a ""Have you considered this? What do you think about it?"" way. Things like, ""let me tell you about autogynephilia, do you think it\'s a real thing and is it as harmful to the trans community as they think it is?"" and, ""well if you say trans women can benefit from trans only spaces, then doesn\'t it follow that natal women should have their own women only spaces?"" These discussions really got me to thinking, along with what are basically free lectures about gender and society and various social movements. My eyes were gradually opening.\n\nFlash forward to a few weeks ago. My TIM friend retweeted something along the lines of ""there should be classes for trans women that teach them all the things that women learn as girls."" I had opinions about this, including ""stuff like this reduces the lived experience of women\'s childhoods to a fantasy stereotype and makes many very inaccurate assumptions,"" which I voiced in a quote-retweet.\n\nThis was unacceptable enough to my TIM friend that he unfollowed my personal (locked) Twitter account. He didn\'t say anything to me, didn\'t use the much more subtle mute function. Just unfollowed. I was very bothered by that. I thought we were friends? Well, fine. I decided to excuse myself from his life by leaving the groups he\'d started, and unfollowing/unfriending on various other social media.\xa0I didn\'t want to cause him further distress by voicing what I felt were very basic feminist points of view.\n\nDuring the weeks between then and now, I sat and asked myself a lot of questions. Two of the biggest were: Why did I find this so upsetting? Am I actually one of those transphobic women who the TWAW group thinks should be physically harmed?\n\nI realized that it upset me because a longtime friend had done something that effectively silenced me without even trying to discuss it. Me, a woman, who has dealt with this crap all my life. Silenced yet again by someone with a man\'s upbringing--by a man--who went from hypermasculine to spending over $1000 at Sephora and god knows how much at Torrid in the span of six months because he thinks that\'s what being a woman is about. And he somehow thinks he has more right to play out a caricature of womanhood without giving real thought to real experiences of women, than I have a right to point out the harmful gender stereotypes I have to see and live through every day.\n\nThen, my answer to my second big question: Firstly, wow no, I definitely shouldn\'t be physically harmed for what I said. Secondly, no, I\'m not transphobic. Recognizing that there are huge differences in how boys and girls are raised and socialized is just recognizing facts, and no amount of makeup or clothing or voice coaching or changing how you sit/stand/move will ever, ever erase that. I have no problem with someone identifying as trans, I just don\'t believe that they can ever declare themselves a woman like any other, or a man like any other, and stay honest in their life, including things like saying they support women\'s rights. How can you support women\'s rights if you won\'t even let women talk about their periods in your company? But you can talk about your ""girldick"" anywhere and everywhere? \n\nSo, it got to where I was continuing to Google various gender and trans related things in my spare time, and yesterday I came across an article written by a TIM, as well as a blog by another TIM, where they discussed things like autogynephilia and how the TRA has been damaging to feminism. They also, of course, talked about the backlash they and others have gotten as a result of voicing legitimate criticisms of today\'s trans rights movement. Eventually I found myself on this sub, and spent some hours reading, and seeing so much that makes sense. It actually moved me enough to finally make a Reddit account. I didn\'t realize how much I needed this until now, and I\'ve been reading and reading the threads and resources. I just blindly accepted what the TRAs around me were saying (well, except for the whole wishing death on all women and men who aren\'t trans thing), and didn\'t understand until now that it\'s being used as another way for men to silence  women. \n\nI\'m super new to this sub and GC, so I don\'t have all of the language down, and I\'m still working through critically reviewing my years and years of libfem thinking, but I feel like I\'m on the right track by coming here.', 'Semi small peak but apparently, according to TIMs we are so intimidated by them! Apparently bottom surgery results are so dang good that even the worst results are a great approximation 🤦🏽\u200d♀️ Do these men not hear themselves or read what they type? Not a single woman is intimidated by a larping male with a fetish. The only reason we would be isn’t because of your surgically altered genitalia sir, it’s because you’re male. Sorry we’re more concerned about having our rights stripped away and trying to maintain sex segregated spaces while having to be lumped with you lot of misogynistic assholes that truly, deep down think women’s anatomy is just a fuckhole. Their heads are so far up their own ass.', 'When I realized they are hypocritical and illogical. According to them, sex is not equal to gender (e.g. “biological males are not men”) but gender is equal to sex (e.g. “transwomen are women”). I fully peaked when I saw the “genital preference is transphobic” side of Twitter and I saw people bully lesbians for saying they don’t want to date TIMs.', ""Steven Hassan uses the BITE model (behavior control, information control, thought control, and emotional control) to break down if a group can be considered a cult. \n\nHits the mark with the Trans movement in many aspects. That's when the light bulb really came on for me."", ""The fact that THEY ARE SO SURE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A WOMAN. If I was a guest or newcomer in someone's community, I would listen. See what I could do to help. Maybe make some friends. Not hijack the conversation, unless, idk, I've been used to being a dude in room full of women."", ' I\'ve been reading this sub for a while, as someone who\'s become increasingly dissatisfied with liberal feminism -- I\'m trying to learn some alternative points of view, because I don\'t like where things are going. I don\'t like the eerie feeling I get when all my liberal friends seem to be reading from the same script and not thinking. These are highly intelligent people which makes it all the more disturbing; the place where I see this happen the most is in discussions of trans issues. \n\nI\'ve always tried to be extremely supportive of trans people. No, it\'s more than that -- I feel genuinely joyful for them, for people who have discovered a new life and found fulfillment and authenticity and happiness. I want that for all of us. \n\nBut I\'m becoming less and less able to tolerate the idea that ""if your feminism doesn\'t include trans women, it isn\'t feminism"". The thing that triggered my need to post here was reading an article about how to feminize your voice if you\'re a trans woman. It actually made me feel nauseated, so offended and upset. It was a small thing -- something about how to sound like a woman you need to sound less sure of yourself, less confrontational, to finish your sentences as if they\'re questions. \n\nAnd I thought about how women absorb these imperatives from birth -- the necessity of being quiet and unsure and yielding and gentle and unassuming -- and I just got so upset. Like... These are not cute affectations we put on because our feminity is a fundamental part of our identity! They are symptomatic of oppression that women learn from the moment we are born! I\'m not a ""cis woman"" who ends my sentences like questions because I\'m so feminine! I\'m an intelligent human who was raised to hate herself because of her biology. \n\nI don\'t know how to reconcile these realizations with my desire to be supportive and open minded and accepting, but I also know I could never share these feelings with my liberal friends, even (especially?) the most feminist among them. So I came here, because I needed to tell someone. Thanks for listening.', 'I think my first wake up call that something wasn’t right is when the whole “pussy hats”/women’s march discourse unfolded. Being told that women weren’t inclusive for celebrating their vaginas was the first time I was like “Wait... huh?”\n\nBut my real peak trans moment happened afterwards. I love watching the tv show Botched. Seeing the realistic consequences of plastic surgery has really helped me come to peace with my body. I’d rather accept my flaws than potentially disfigure myself.\n\nAnyway, I watched one episode where a TiM was getting a revision on their breast augmentation because they didn’t think it was good enough. The doctor ended up giving them very nice, proportionate and even breasts.\n\nBut this person was so upset and threw a fit because they weren’t “feminine” or “perfect” enough.\n\nI immediately had this wash of anger over me. I was a “late bloomer” and flat chested until I was in high school. All of a sudden I sprouted these small breasts and was so upset and uncomfortable when my mom sat me down and told me it was time to wear a bra to school.\n\nI’m 100% a woman and I did not get to choose my breasts. None of us did. The idea that a TiM is crying because their surgically engineered breasts aren’t “feminine” enough when we “cis “ women have had to accept whatever we were born with sent me over the edge', ""I am female, and have two little girls. We are part of an international club.  There was man... Probably 50's or 60's? He followed me around at meetings, stood way too close behind me, etc.  At one point I tried to escape without confrontation, by going into the women's bathroom for a while. When I came out, he was waiting for me. He asked me if I would comb his long hair for him once.  Eventually, the women in the group compared notes and realized we had all had uncomfortable experiences with him. We established a distress signal, and made sure to watch out for newcomers and head him off.  \n\nThen he grabbed my 7 year old.  \n\nHe grabbed her by the hips as she went by and held on.  I told her very firmly to come here Right Now, as I didn't want to scare her by screaming or hitting, or inspire him to get violent.  They were on the other side of a table from me.  He wouldn't let her go, he just laughed.  A man who knew what had been going on and happened to be sitting right by him tore him a new one, and he finally let go.  I gathered up my girls and hustled them out the door while creepy dude was getting a tongue lashing.  \n\nCreepy dude made it to between us and the exit in the hallway outside, and demanded to know if he had gone too far, to apologize, to explain, whatever. I mumbled something and got out, and he went back inside and screamed at everyone, calling them bullies and mean, to the point where the police were almost called because they feared there would be violence.  \n\nHe was banned from the group, and some people volunteered to walked me to my car to make sure he wouldn't try anything.  He was also told not to contact me or my children at any time, ever.  \n\nA couple months later, he contacts me again!  I had him blocked, but apparently if you are a member of the same group on Facebook, that doesn't count.  And lo, he is now a woman. And now that he is a woman, everything is fine!  There is no need to worry.  We can hang out!  Also he is helping out with children's activities now!  Because he is a woman!  And it's fine!  And his son misses my girls and wants to play with them again, and misses the food I make because I am such a good cook (true), and wants to learn!! And it's fine!  Everything is fine.

I have to admit- like others have said- I don\'t think I had \\*one\\* moment, but rather a series, and a conviction that got stronger, and a growing sense of urgency about this issue. I\'ve always been on the gender critical side, and instinctively felt that third wave feminism was self-defeating bullshit, but couldn\'t really articulate that feeling well until a few years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember having reservations when friends started pushing petitions to transfer particular trans identified males, convicted for violent crimes, sometimes against women, into female prisons about 5 or so years ago, arguing that they weren\'t safe in men\'s prisons. The logical inconsistency of that seemed obvious to me, even if one were to fully accept the idea of innate gender identity, but friends simply could not or would not see it. So I couldn\'t bring myself to support it, and took some flak for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next two events that set off alarm bells for me were a feminist assaulted by a trans woman at Hyde Park Corner and the intimidation of feminists at Goldsmiths ""radical"" book fair. I didn\'t witness either in person, but read all the accounts, from both sides- there\'s video footage of the first, and it\'s clear what happened, yet there was incredible cognitive dissonance about it. That cognitive dissonance told me that something was deeply wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have a rights movement, and someone really fucks up- say, by being racist, or assaulting a woman- you eject that person from your movement. In this case, they didn\'t do that- they tried to pretend it didn\'t happen, and blamed the assault on the woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext up was a certain misogynistic teenage male trying to get a women\'s officer in the Labour party fired, so he could take her role.  He led a campaign of continual harassment against women and particularly lesbians, and now calls himself one, and is now the women\'s officer for my constituency. We were called to a meeting and asked to sign a statement, and to \\*chant\\* a pledge, saying that we believed that all women\'s roles in the party should be open to anyone identifying as a woman on the basis of self ID, that trans women were women, and that there was no place for transphobes (by which they meant gender critical women) in the party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were also asked to endorse the sexist ramblings of a certain trans-identified academic at Goldsmiths, who has led a nationwide witch hunt to remove GC feminist academics from their posts, and to welcome him to address the women\'s conference. I lost my rag, and left the party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere\'s actually too much to list. But the worst thing I have witnessed, and to me the most terrifying, was the treatment of my lesbian friends (I\'m straight, but these things do not escape my notice). Two friends in particular were told their sexuality was wrong, that they were ""genital fetishists"" and that they need to ""reconsider"" their dating preferences. This is the final straw for me, and I will not countenance this badly repackaged rapey bullshit being directed at lesbians.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and then there was the stitch up consultation followed by Hampstead Heath ladies pond being opened up to males. That was a special place for me- it enabled me to swim again, 15 years after being assaulted as a child at a swimming baths, and years of phobia and severe PTSD. I met other women there who used it for the same reason. It makes me desperately sad that it\'s been lost to us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for such a long post- I feel like I\'m finally venting everything in one place! I think I\'ll imminently be suspended from twitter, so this seemed like a logical place to find some feminists and sanity...', 'Recently a black trans woman was killed. Before that the same trans woman was on video being beaten by men.

But no matter what you do is enough so...\n\nAnd the real kicker is that women are afraid to talk about abortion rights anymore due to trans folks derailing the convo to say ""not all women have vaginas"" ""you\'re excluding trans people"".

It just makes me sick thinking about it. \nI keep thinking I have prodessed all of his lies and then some thing else hits me."", 'I\'ve been always openly gender critical. But my philosophy is that adults can do whatever they wish with their body for whatever reason (which isn\'t the same as misleading people about rationality of those decisions, abusing kids and feeling entitled to violate boundaries and distort the reality). \n\nBeing gender critical went perfectly well for me with being trans-friendly (and those I met online and offline were not TRAs).  I was just hugely ignorant and underestimated the problems with transgenderism. My peak trans came after I commented on a couple of articles and the AI decided that I was interested in more trans stories and recommended me a bunch of them. They were intended to be trans positive but instead read as bizarrely grotesque and promoting gender stereotypes. Those were written by autogynephilic males but at the time I had no idea about autogynephilia. Curious, I started googling and found out the current state of things. \n\nAs I traced old publications and remembered my own discussions, transgenderism seems to have grown from gender criticism flipped on its head. \n\n\\- First, there were discussions about gender stereotypes and bias, how they hurt women and girls in STEM, toys should not be gendered, let gender non-conforming kids be themselves etc. (feels like centuries ago but it was less than a decade). \n\n\\- Then came ""trans kids"" claiming to be the opposite sex and there was a lot of screaming that they should be allowed to use bathrooms matching their ""gender identity"" (according to the editing history on Wikipedia, this term also went through changes). \n\n\\- (my peak trans) Parents and doctors started transing kids and trans women became women. \n\n\\- (you are here) Biological sex is conflated with self-declared ""gender identity"", which is fluid and vulnerable to ""misgendering"" at the same time. Biological sex in government records changed at will, pronoun control, language manipulation, males in women sports, endless lies and shaming with ""transphobia"" etc. Left is right, up is down and visa versa. \n\nHow long do we have before:\n\n\\- All women shelters close down as they can\'t resolve a conflict between serving vulnerable women and ""human rights"" of intact males to share rooms with them?\n\n\\- Women sports cease to exist for those born female?\n\n\\- Employers realise that they don\'t have to hire ""uterus owners"" (who can get pregnant) if they can declare half of their male workforce to be ""women""? \n\n\\- We have a society with 657 genders, where the Maiden gender is obliged to carry babies impregnated by the Commander gender, as the remaining genders were sterilized as children and got their genitals shaped into flowers and butterflies?', 'I recently peaked again when someone posted in a Facebook group a news article about the TIM that sexually assaulted a 10 year old girl in a public bathroom (the title actually said trans woman instead of just woman) and most of the comments were hurling misogynistic slurs at the perp for making trans people look bad. There were maybe 2 comments sympathizing with the victim.', 'I saw a tweet by Caitlyn Jenner saying he wishes a man would be ""confident"" enough to compliment his appearance. (someone replied ""nice balls dude"" lol). I know that most men have no issue whatsoever complimenting an actual female on her looks. They don\'t do it to him because they know he is a man and they respect him and his humanity. It is the same reason men are anti feminism until it is pro trans, and are suddenly such ardent feminists they tell real women that they are bigots and silence them. Women born women will never, have never, gotten that respect. When we talk about feminism, they don\'t take our word for it. But once a TIM (these terms are new to me, be patient!) says it is real, at least their version of it, suddenly it is truth... In a way women have been trying to get themselves to be seen for decades and decades and have failed.', 'I am forcing myself to have the courage to post my peak trans story here because it\'s been building up for the past several months and I seriously need to get it out lol. So to start, I basically drank the gender kool-aid since high school to mid-way junior year of college, which is like six years of my life, and it is blowing my mind how much I have changed in such a short period of time. \n\nAround Nov-Dec last year, this guy in one of my classes made the Classic ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" and there are ""52 genders"" joke. Instead of getting offended (like I would\'ve at that time), I decided to take it upon myself to research the internet because I was like, you know what, I am going to find the answer to how many genders there are and end the debate once and for all (lol). So literally my entire Christmas break was just me reading article after article, watching video after video, and I was kind of obsessed with finding the answer, but I was never satisfied with what I found. \n\nI remember by the time I got back to school, I was even more confused than before I went into it. I kept asking all the questions like “what really is a woman” and “what does being a woman feel like and how could you know” etc., because I realized that I never had to ask these questions as a woman myself. I also had heard the term TERF and it was apparently anti-trans, but I decided I wanted to learn what it meant anyway to see if I could understand it. I think I eventually ended up here and I found that I was finally getting answers that made sense and followed logically (aka I learned the crazy concept that a woman is really an adult human female).\n\nIt’s kind of embarrassing how quickly I accepted the idea of gender identity and I cringe at how I blindly followed it like I was a freaking zombie. I mean, I was a pretty heavy tumblr user in my high school days, so that probably explains it. But I always think about the kinds of conversations I would have with the friends I had at that time (who were also SJWs) and its crazy how it seemed to make so much sense in my head then. Comparing this with who I am now, I feel like I’ve changed for the better (or at least I hope). I’ve learned that it’s really important to think critically, don’t let your own bias get in the way, and always listen to opposing arguments because you never know what you might find. \n\nAnyways, my story is dumb, but I’m here now lol. And I’m kind of angry (more like a lot angry) at how it all seems to be getting worse. I think the thing that bothers me the most is how the definition of homosexuality seems to be changing amongst these people. Like I’ve struggled for so long trying to come to terms with who I am and what it means to be a lesbian. But now all of a sudden, people are just trying to change it like it means nothing! Or like they are acting as if the term lesbian has “always” included TIMs. Suddenly, I am actually a “vagina fetishist” or I am obsessed with what’s in other people’s pants. As if I don\'t already feel ostracized enough as it is, now I gotta deal with my supposed fetish -_- I mean I know it\'s BS, but I don\'t think they realize how harmful they\'re being saying that to someone like me.\n\nAnything I read now that has to do with that or gender identity, I just face palm. This subreddit has changed my views on so many things, but I’m done ranting now and if you actually read all this, hi.', 'Apologies if I articulate this poorly, I’ll try to keep it short. \n\nBasically, I’m a straight, cis-woman. I have a very straight type body, so small chest, butt, not a lot of shape going on, and reasonably tall.

Look, I get it. It’s usually when someone sees me from behind. I know a ton of women this happens to and we all laugh about it. I always tell people its cool and move on with my day. \n\nAnyway, with that being said, I used to support trans rights. Why don’t I anymore? Probably because I’ve had trans people and supporters tell me in person that I’m probably a TIF. Umm...just because I have short hair and don’t wear make up on a daily basis? I’ve been told how lucky I am to look the way I do because passing would be so easy. \nThat, combined with the overwhelmingly male presence as TIMs. The whole “how did you first know you were a woman?” And their response is always some kind of “oh, well, I’ve always loved make up and wearing dresses and pink!” And then their obsession with how women “look” and it’s all about the boobs and hair and wearing tight fitting short skirts. \nSo now somehow I’m less of a woman for just being kinda flat chested and playing in the dirt?\nI was a total tomboy of a kid. That does not mean I am secretly a boy. \nI guess the whole notion of sex versus gender pisses me off.

I logged into Facebook where I was a member of a tag group called ""This Man Makes Me So Thankful I\'m a Lesbian."" Most of the posts were what you would think, AKA men being ignorant/misogynist/etc. But someone posted some bullshit article about how we lesbians are just the worst if we don\'t want to date TW. The post itself and the ensuing comments are like a fully-checked bingo card of the typical lesbophobic TRA bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScreenshots are [here](https://imgur.com/a/ENEtCNj).

I left the group in disgust because obviously, despite having ""lesbian"" in the name it is not welcoming to lesbians.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to try to empathize with TW,.I really did. I even had a friend who is one, but honestly this person was so self-centered and exhausting that I just let the friendship fizzle out over time. Also they told me they masturbated to me when they KNEW I wasn\'t into them and it just made me feel so creeped out and gross. By the way, what is with the ""well most TW don\'t want to use their penises during sex"" argument? Part of the problem is the presence of a dick, yes, but it\'s also the absence of a vulva! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThankfully I am now married to another GC lesbian so I do not have to worry about dating again. I worry about my sisters, though, and all the butch girls being transed. I\'m femme but my wife is butch. We\'re in our thirties. If she were  too much younger she probably would have been transed because she liked to play in dirt, hated wearing dresses/pink/anything girly, wouldn\'t carry a purse, was upset about growing breasts (both because they weighed her down and it changed how people/men treated her), etc. Interestingly, her super homophobic family probably has a better grasp on what the actual definition of the word ""lesbian"" is than the ultra-woke tumblr crowd. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that has bothered me is the fact that my local Pride celebration changed part of the name of something associated with it from ""lez"" to ""rainbow,"" when it had been ""lez"" for years precisely because lesbians have historically been on the margin of large male-oriented Pride celebrations. But now it\'s not ""inclusive"" enough. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to belong to a group called XX Fitness but they changed the name to ""anything but cis men fitness"" because it\'s heresy to acknowledge that XX people (also known as WOMEN) have different needs and challenges than XY people (also known as MEN) do in the area of fitness! Let\'s center men in the title instead! Oh and the Lady Parts Justice League thing! Can\'t call \'em ""lady parts"" because some folks might be butthurt. Better to say ""people with uteruses"" because that isn\'t dehumanizing and degrading at all. BTW, does anyone know how many TIFs actually have abortions?

Thanks for reading this far.', 'I think my peaking happened gradually (especially since I never fully subscribed to the trans ideology in the first place, but at that time also couldn\'t see the harm in it.) One thing I remember though is this man who was a member of the same Facebook group as I. The group wasn\'t focused on transgenderism per se but there was a wide acceptance for it. The man in question had a wife and a daughter that was around ten I think, and the man had now decided that he was a woman. His wife apparently had some concerns about this and was especially adamant that she still saw herself as a heterosexual woman and not a lesbian. This hurt the mans feeling because it meant that his wife didn\'t see him as a woman. \n\nWhat really got to me was the massive support this man recieved from the group. So many people said that his wife had to think about her behaviour, understand that sexuality was fluid, realize how she made *him* feel. Nothing about how strange it must be for this woman to have her husband suddenly insisting on her being a lesbian. I found it absolutely insane how no one seemed to understand that it was completely ridiculous to suggest that this woman\'s sexuality would somehow change because her husband thought differently regarding his personal identitiy.\n\nThere was also some issue with the woman wanting their daughter to still be allowed to call the man ""dad"", but this was hurtful to the mans feeling. It was very clear to me then that a lot of these men are egotistical and that their supporters are supporting this behaviour at the expense of women and children.', 'I\'ve had many peak trans moments, but a recent-ish one reminded me of why I peaked in the first place.\n\nThere was a discussion about why so many fanfiction readers hate mpreg (aka male pregnancy/stories in which men get pregnant), and a TIF was like, ""this is erasure because some men can get pregnant.""\n\nI said something like, ""that\'s great and all, but mpreg is male pregnancy, and no human males can get pregnant.""\n\nCue the TIF getting mad.

It was so fucking useless. \n\nI\'ve had serious mental health issues since I was pre-teen, lots of trauma relating to my sex and sexuality and I was extremely dissociative and out of my body while going through the self-mutilation called transitioning. I wanted to abandon my whole past, my painful womanhood and start all over again as anything other than female. Only when I had awful trauma flashbacks about sexual abuse, stopped dissociating and ""came back to my body"" one year after the mastectomy I realized what has been done to my beautiful body. Even though I was mentally ill, it was easy for me to have the trans diagnosis and access hormones and get a mastectomy. I was deep in the trans activist /queer community and I pretty much cut all the contact with every friend who wasn\'t in that cult cause I feared they might be ""transphobic"". In that cult I was told how to lie to mental health professionals to get the right diagnosis as soon as possible. When I had any second thoughts, other cult members said ""if you think whether you are trans, you are trans. Cis people don\'t question their gender."" How fucking dangerous is to say things like that? Just lies lies lies and delusions.\n\nWhen I tried to publicly talk about my detransition, some trans activist accused me of lying about what I\'ve experienced (like wtf how could she know about what I\'ve experienced??) and also told me I\'m being irresponsible for making the trans community look bad and that I should be more careful with my words etc. Now I actually feel that I actually WANT TO make it look bad, because the community is so cult-like.\n\nI don\'t know what\'s my single ""peak trans moment"" because there has been so many absolutely fucked up things in the TRA community that I\'ve witnessed closely. It\'s hard to understand now how I didn\'t question all that bullshit when I wanted to transition. Non of that ideology makes sense to me anymore. I was fully engaged in all the ""die cis scum"" madness and it\'s so hard to understand how it all happened. It had a lot to do with two of my friends who I related to a lot and who were both transitioning. I thought that I\'m so much like them that I have to be trans too. Now they have both detransitioned too and dealt a lot with their trauma and dissociation. Like yeah, I related to them - not because we were all trans, but because we were all fucking severely traumatized and mentally ill gender noncorming women. And that\'s how it happens, trans identity is like a contagious disease among dissociative young people, especially young women. My dysphoria was real, their dysphoria was real, but not because we were trans but because we were women in misogynist world.\n\n[EDIT: I deleted everything I wrote about an aggressive ""trans butch dyke"" I know, because I\'m afraid (s)he somehow finds out about this thread and about my comment. Maybe the fact that I need to edit this comment because of my own safety tells you enough about the people in TRA movement]\n\nAnd one more ""peak trans moment"": another friend of mine, trans woman who I have always supported 100% with her transition, always talks to me about her ""periods"" and it drives me fucking mad. I have had unbearably painful and heavy periods since I was 9 years old. No doctor has ever taken me seriously. Every month I cry and scream in my bed for days, sometimes pass out and vomit because of the pain. It feels so fucking horrible when someone who doesn\'t know a shit about how pms and menstruation feels like talks about having pms symptoms and ""periods"". No no no no.\n\nThe whole trans movement makes me so sad. I wish I could stop all the young people making permanent changes to their bodies. I miss all the gender noncorforming men and women who have ceased to exist because of the trans ideology.\n\nI also know some trans people who seem to really feel much better and ""more like themselves"" after transitioning, so this issue is not all black and white even though I am becoming more and more ""terfy"".', 'I peaked months ago, but I’m peaking again due to all these “12th TRANS WOMAN MURDERED THIS YEAR, NATIONAL CRISIS”  news headlines.\n\nNearly 2,000 WOMEN per year are murdered in the US. That number is at maximum like 30 for TIMs.\n\nI do not advocate for murder and violence towards any human being. Not at all. But why is it that when I look up “women murdered statistics” the first results that come up are all about “transgender women”? You have to do some digging with specific searches to find results for actual adult human females. \n\nWhen I look up statistics on women being murdered - I should immediately see those statistics.

My peak trans moment was realizing how willfully oblivious people have become to this biological nature. Despite having always been a staunch LGBT+ advocate, I\'ve come to realize this has all gone way, way too far.\n\nI have the uterus and the ovaries. I had to go through all the painful and invasive tests.  I had to undergo multiple surgeries. Innumberable blood tests. Hundreds of self-injected hormones up to 3 times a day for weeks or months on end. (And yes, that includes Lupron, the dangerous transitioning drug.) I had to deal with the pain and visibility of miscarriages. My partner? He had to do an HIV blood test and cum in a cup a few times. Not saying it wasn\'t emotionally hard on him, but as a woman, I had to undergo all the physical strain to get pregnant, stay pregnant, function during pregnancy complications, give birth, breastfeed, etc. No matter how much my loving huband \\*wanted\\* to take that load from me, he couldn\'t. Because, ya know, biology.\n\nMy peak trans moment came when I finally, finally got pregnant and kept the pregnancy to the second trimester. I finally braved joining one of the reddit ""bumper"" groups for other women due at the same time as me. This then transitioned to a Facebook group which implemented this terrible, reality-bending rule.\n\nYou could not say ""Hey mamas!"" because what if someone there identifies as a birth-giving father? You cannot say ""us pregnant ladies"" because what if someone there identifies as a pregnant \\*man\\*. You cannot say ""We\'re all badass life-giving women!"" because men can give life too!\n\nNote that no trans people advocated for this rule nor made their existence known. This was entirely on the pregnant women who created the group trying to make sure they didn\'t hurt anybody\'s feelings just in case they \\*did\\* exist. The language policing was ridiculous and downright offensive as someone who can tell you a \\*man\\*, by definition, cannot ever get pregnant or endure what I and other infertile women have had to endure.\n\nIn closing, let me point out that even in cases where the man is infertile (low sperm issues) and the woman is not, it is the WOMAN who goes through all the medical procedures because the science is still focused on pumping the woman full of hormones and doing invasive procedures like IUIs and IVF to increase the couple\'s chances. There is simply no ability to change the inherent biology with ""transition"" surgeries or hormones, and anybody who has struggled to get pregnant should be able to see this for what it is.', ""Little things have been building up over time, but something about Jazz Jennings made it so I can't lie to myself about this anymore, I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't speak up about this.\n\nThat and the cotton ceiling.

There was no specific incident that made me critical of the trans movement, but dealing with one of my friends becoming a TIF and the aftermath might count as a drawn out peak trans.\n\nBackstory: A female friend of mine (who was a huuuge fujoshi/yaoi fangirl as a teen) came out as a \'transman\' after her first year of college and started dating another girl. I and the rest of her friends tried to be supportive, but she was a huge pain in the ass- unrelentingly narcissistic, hyper-emotional, and she would randomly devolve into bizarre misogynistic spiels. She would also mistreat and belittle her gf, and it was obvious that she was only with this girl to sponge off of her (since the other girl was quite well off). \n\nSome of her greatest hits:\n\n\\>She broke up with her wealthy girlfriend and declared that she was a gay man, and that she only dated this woman due to structural homophobia, transphobia, and heteronormativity. \n\n\\>She briefly got into a FWB arrangement with one of our straight male friends who she knew had a crush on her, and started to publicly demand he start calling himself bi or gay lest he \\~invalidate her identity\\~. She and the rest of her trans friends harassed him for *weeks* until he eventually cut off all contact with her and the rest of us.\n\n\\>She had a tumblr where she would post her yaoi fanfiction and art (keep in mind she is an adult at this point), and would harass the teenage girls who followed her or reblogged her art for ""fetishizing gay men"" and call them homophobes. Despite her insistence that she was a real gay man, it was very clear that she expected gay relationships to be just like the ones in fanfiction.\n\n\\>Meanwhile, in real life she was catfishing actual gay men and trying to guilt them into sex. After she would inevitably get rejected, she\'d go on social media to whine about ""cis f\\*ggots"". \n\n\\>She took to calling herself a ""dirty sodomite"", ""cocksucking f\\*g"", and a number of other disgusting homophobic slurs.\n\n\\>After getting rejected by actual gay men for the umpteenth time, she eventually decided to settle for another TIF who she met through tumblr. (CONTENT WARNING: MEGA CRINGE) She introduces this woman to others as her ""bottom boy"" and casually refers to her as a ""cumslut"". Since they met due to being part of the same fandom, they occasionally refer to one another by the names of their favorite male/male OTP, with my TIF ex-friend being the \'top\' character and her gf being the \'bottom\' one.', 'Spending time with my friend’s baby was probably what led me to peak. It’s all well and good to believe things when you’re around a bunch of likeminded people online and away from the inherency of humans, but when you get into the biological reality of men and women, it just really illuminates how absolutely ridiculous transgenderism is. My friend had a baby late last year and I’ve been spending time with it. Obviously, I wasn’t present during delivery, but it’s piqued my interest in having kids. \n\nSeeing the absolute beauty that women are able to create is mind boggling. My friend made a fucking human. The fact that a bunch of weird men who feel left out of sleepovers and like wearing makeup think that they can claim the word woman makes me sick.', 'Been lurking for a while and it\'s probably time I should contribute to this. \n\nI frequently used tumblr as a teenager. I was (like tons of teens) uncomfortable with the changes happening to my body and people on tumblr convinced me that I must be transgender. Regardless of the fact that I was the first person in my school cohort to grow breasts at age 11 and was bullied by my peers for this, and I am bisexual and was pretty GNC as a teen - people on the internet readily suggested I was transgender even though they did not know me in real life. \n\nAround age 17/18 I came out to family and friends as being transgender and asked that they use a different name and pronouns, wore a binder (there is literally no safe way to wear a binder!), and wore clothes for teen guys. I even went through a process of counselling with a local transgender support service, where even in the first counselling session the counsellor suggested I begin to plan my medical transition if I was already interested in getting it started. \n\nDue to finances and career circumstances I thankfully did not go through a medical transition. I\'m near the end of my years at university and it was one of the best things to happen to me - I was exposed to many political views and ideologies that I did not see on the parts of the internet I usually went on and this has absolutely lead me to re-examine my identity. I\'ve found this reddit forum after already spending a few months rediscovering what being a woman means to me and trying to find people who had similar experiences to me, and finding feminists who are advocating for women being women has been honestly inspiring. \n\nMy peak trans is definitely every person I encounted on my journey - the people on tumblr, the enthusiastic and biased counsellors, the ""transgender"" people at my university who used to minimise the problems affecting women, ethnic minorities, and GLB people in favour of promoting discussion of their own issues and treating these people disrespectfully because of their ""transphobia"". But I feel sorry for other ""transgender"" youth I met who are clearly struggling with other issues and have had the same experience as me but haven\'t realised yet.', ""As I've mentioned in another comment, I used to be crazy libfem.

Then I started reading more of what TIMs were saying online, about having 'periods' specifically, that their 'periods' are just as bad as a female's. That really bothered me, because I have insanely bad periods, I've bled out to the point of needing hospitalization twice (and I'm pretty young). When I tried to bring this up, I was told that I was being a bitch and making it to be about me. \nThen I really started seeing the insane entitlement of people around me, that nothing would ever be enough. They couldn't just have a gender neutral space, they had to have access to female spaces because ut validated them, and they only cared about their validation and not the needs or words of women. \nThen I found this group and have a new peak almost every day.

You can\'t make that sort of dissonance up.', ""  \n\nI’m new to all this and Reddit, so hope I’m doing it right. I’m nervous! I’d been searching for people who share my views and recently discovered Gender Critical Feminism and Woman’s Place. Sorry this is long. I used to be a ‘live and let live, if it makes them happy, whatever’ person, but Tumblr made me see it’s a cult. I had five peaks: \n\nTumblr: I had to blacklist trans issues, because although I got on well with some, they invaded every topic/fandom and derailed the conversation. The main thing that bothered me was that they are often perpetrators of homosexual erasure They transify celebrities, even dead ones and claim gays are either bisexual/pan or on the trans spectrum. No one was allowed to be bog-standard gay anymore, according to the trans kids. Everyone is bisexual or pansexual and their life depends on this belief; suicide threats ensue if challenged. They insist fictional characters are trans and have tantrums and when people don’t like their interpretation of it. This is followed by tons of anon hate messages, which I suspect are sent to themselves so they can copy and paste pre-written ‘sassy’ clapbacks, whilst simultaneously playing victim. \n\nPeak 2: There’s an aggressive and narcissistic teenage trans ‘boy’ who is around 16 now: I’ll refer to this individual as SHE. She wears ridiculously hyperfeminine clothes: pink tights, old ladies’ pearl necklaces, frilly, lacey doily-like clothes, Pat Butcher style dangly earrings, glittery makeup. However, she demands you address her as a man. Woe betide anyone who ‘mistakes’ her for a woman on account of the clothes, because ‘fabric has no gender’ and she has to dress like my great grandmother to hide from the ‘transphobic oppressive society’ around her somewhere in eastern USA. Other days she wears typical tomboy clothes. She was recently dating a boy, but has since ‘gone heterosexual.’ My opinion? She’s a lesbian who experiments with both feminine and masculine looks. I don't even think she's bisexual. She most certainly is not a hetero man who happens to like hyper-feminine outfits 3 days per week and has changed her name several times, each sounding more Victorian than the last.\n\nPeak 3: The Autistic Women’s Network added Non-Binary to its title. I unfollowed for two reasons – trans people were dominating the comments with their usual narcissism, but also, many articles were focused on trans issues. Even though I relate to the whole gender-non-conforming stuff like many autistic people do, it was yet another hijacking by unconvincing trans people. If they’re non-binary – which I personally don’t believe in, then surely they believe they’re female some days, so why should they desperately need to rename it non-binary? It’s another way of men pushing into a female space. Secondly, a lot of these trans people use autism as a badge of honour and an excuse to act an entitled douche. “oh, it’s my bad social skills, made even worse by the fact I was socialised according to the gender forced on me at birth. PS I’m so unique’. As a real autistic person, I refuse to be associated with these narcissists.\n\nPeak 4: Seeing a TIM complaining of his period cramps. When asked how, if he has neither the organ nor the prostaglandin action required, real women supported him by saying period pain isn’t necessarily in just the uterus. When a rational person explained that leg/back pain is referred pain from the uterus, via connected nerves and suggested he should get his kidneys and digestive system checked, there was a lot of ‘TERF SCUM’ stuff, being thrown around, not just from trans people but women too. One came in to say her mother had a hysterectomy and still gets PMS, so the trans person is really having period pain. Turned out her mother still had ovaries and this is a common thing amongst women who have had PARTIAL-hysterectomies. That fact didn’t go down well. \n\nPeak 5, last one! A girl I used to know transitioned, detransitioned and retransitioned again and completely lied about how she was treated growing up. Claimed to be a sweet meek victim, who was ostracised for presenting male. She was actually a loud, confident and feminine girl, more the bully than the victim and it was her sister that was the tomboy. She’s a raging narcissistic TRA and I just rolled my eyes when I found out all her lies and claims of constant oppression, plus the usual ‘I’m autistic’ badge."", 'Ally-to-Radfem here. I’m about 3 months post-peak, still in recovery, and experiencing some unexpected side effects from the transition. Nevertheless, I’m certain that this was the right choice. I’m so much happier living as a feminist now instead of dealing with the daily agony of cognitive ~~dysphoria~~ dissonance as a trans ally. \n\nIt hasn’t always been easy – I’ve had to make some sacrifices to adjust to my new life, but I think it’s been worth it. For example, yesterday I gave up the last of my fucks about men’s opinions of me. I’ve held on to those for so many years that they were nearly a crutch for my self-worth. I was worried that letting go might be destabilizing but amazingly my self-worth has only gotten more validated in in their absence.

It sounded like she was having body image issues, which is sad, but I don't see how this doesn't make her a woman?"", 'I\'ve been lurking for a while but made an account because I shift from being perplexed to irritated to angry each time a trans issue arises. Twenty years ago I was accepting of people with GID. It was fairly rare and it was commonly understood as a mental disorder. As with anyone who had a mental illness, I felt they deserved sympathy and reasonable support from society. I thought their therapy should be covered by insurance and that people who saw them in public should keep their mouths shut and not harass them. I never imagined that the medical community\'s solution for GID would be to participate in the delusion. There are some disorders where playing along is the path of least resistance, but that usually happens in an institutional setting with people who are too far gone to function in society. \n\nI have taken classes on gender and sexuality. I\'m fully aware that there are intersex conditions that can run the gamut from AIS to extra chromosomes to all sorts of other fascinating anomalies. But those conditions are just that - anomalies. Just as people who have GID are not healthy typical humans but are suffering from a mental condition like those of us with depression or anxiety or BPD. \n\nI feel like the medical field is using people with genuine mental health issues as guinea pigs for John Money-like experiments and they\'re wreaking havoc on people\'s lives under the guise of being ""supportive"" and ""accepting"". I\'ve read articles and posts from people who have detransitioned and most of them are heartbreaking. What I find absolutely disgusting is that the rest of society is being bullied into this ridiculous game and told that if we don\'t play along then we\'re transphobic. Even worse, if we live in a liberal community and hold these opinions then we\'ll be perceived as being as immoral as Ted Bundy and become social pariahs. \n\nIf someone is intersex then perhaps a surgical intervention is necessary depending on their condition. If someone has a gender disorder then they need therapy and maybe psychopharmaceuticals, but certainly not surgery. Most people acknowledge that an amputation fetishist shouldn\'t be allowed to ask their surgeon to cut off their leg, but this can be less harmful than what many doctors are doing to teens who claim they were ""misidentified"". \n\nThen, of course, we get into the infuriating self-righteousness of trans activists. They\'re absolutely self-centered, full of judgmental criticism, and have such destructive and invasive agendas. It is not right that men can compete in women\'s sports. It is not right that women\'s spaces and issues get deprioritized in favor of a **minority** of **men**. I can\'t stand that this disorder has been popularized so much that people are either jumping or being pushed into being TIMs or TIFs from social pressure. I do not like being told I\'m discriminating if I forget someone\'s non-intuitive pronouns. I loathe that 14-year-old kids (boys & girls) are being allowed to take hormones and mutilate themselves before they\'ve even really reached an age where they can make big decisions like that. \n\nFinally, it\'s maddening that society (driven by TRAs) has double downed on old stereotypes of male and female. Girls can be into other girls, fixing cars, wearing pants, and having short hair while still being girls. Boys can be into other boys and sewing dresses. Toys and hobbies and sexual attraction don\'t change our sex and absolutely shouldn\'t require any kind of medical intervention.', '[deleted]', 'I\'m not sure if I\'ve had my peak trans moment yet since I\'m still struggling with it.   \nI\'ve always identified myself with the liberal left and I considered it to be one of my ""good traits"" that I was so open-minded. I\'ve always been proud of calling myself a feminist. At 19 I started questioning my sexuality and hence started reading everything I could find about the lgbt community.  For me it was part of the package of accepting myself as bisexual that I also had to approve of all the other genders and sexualities. Phrases like ""born in the wrong body"" , ""gender is a spectrum"" or ""you are transphobic for not letting us participate in women\'s sports"" didn\'t strike me as illogical.

I was a libfem and part of a very liberal friend group on tumblr. I never thought critically about the trans movement, I was just like “oh it’s what all the other progressive people support, I have to support it too!” I reblogged all the cringey mansplaining posts about gender identity and ~friendly reminders~ in order to let everyone know that I, too, was a good feminist. Since I read so much about this innate feeling of womanhood, I started to believe that since I didn’t “feel” like a woman beyond conforming to femininity/stereotypes, I had to be non-binary.\n\nTHANKFULLY, one of the only friends I told happened to be a gender critical woman. At first I thought “yikes she’s transphobic!!!” but then I let myself think critically about it all instead of blindly supporting the movement in an attempt to be as “good” as possible. I hit peak trans. I realized that the “innate feeling of womanhood” that trans women talked about was entirely based on gendered stereotypes. I started questioning things and would publicly post about my concerns, actually wanting to engage in a conversation with other people. Turns out, you don’t get to ask questions. I got doxxed and sent death threats and people would “warn” my friends about me being a terf/transphobe/bigot.

It was years of participating in supposedly female spaces and realizing The Vagina Monologues would’ve never been made today.', 'Sorry this is so long, but it’s been a long time coming. \n\nI’m in my forties now and have always had an attraction to both sexes, from the first stirrings of my sexual self. I was always a tomboyish girl. I hated all girly stuff and flat out refused anything that was pink or feminine. I felt like I was supposed to date boys in high school so I did, but the first person I fell in love with was a girl. As I got older the pressure to “be normal” got more and more intense, so I ran away from home and just came out as a lesbian and went no contact with my family.\n\nThen: the late nineties and early 2000s, when livejournal was the huge thing. I became exposed to the notion of FTM transition for the first time, and started wondering if I was possibly a boy in a woman’s body. I dated butch women sometimes and didn’t really want to BE one, but.. the idea that maybe I could turn into a man was exciting. I was down with being a bisexual or lesbian, but I was one of those “cool girls” who totally still thought men were okay (mostly). \n\nI had heard the word “feminist” but I thought that those were just ugly women who hated men and didn’t shave, and that just wasn’t me, right? A lot of lesbians mistrusted me because I was open about being bisexual; I was told that if I wasn’t a gold star lesbian I would never really fit in with the crowd. I couldn’t understand the rejection. I wasn’t dating women to be cool. Yet my bisexuality was apparently enough to make me untrustworthy. So I started questioning my lesbian relationships. \n\nI avidly followed along with these transition stories I found. There were entire communities dedicated to FTM progress pictures, video blogs (YouTube was just getting going) about the changes the magical Vitamin T brought. Most of these trans guys were young, in college. I watched, fascinated, when they cut off their breasts and posted pictures of the healing process every day. There were a few brave souls who went for the holy grail of bottom surgery. I saw photos and watched videos of transguys masturbating or having sex with their partners with their new pump up penises. I pored over before and after surgery photos from all the new gender reassignment clinics opening up, at first overseas but then in increasing numbers stateside. I was amazed at how quickly a tiny corner of the internet exploded into the mainstream.\n\nI wondered if this was where I was heading. I started thinking about dysphoria, this catch all term that seemed to begin with “anything that makes me uncomfortable about being female” and ended with “something that makes me so uncomfortable I’d rather die than face it”. Did I really hate my body? Was it so terrible to be female that I’d rather have a surgical penis I’d have to pump up and huge scars on my chest, forearm or thigh? If I did transition and wanted to date, would anyone actually want to date me? Or would I just be fetishized?\n\nIt was an older lesbian lover who one day gently corrected me after lovemaking and told me that gender, the way I feel inside, could absolutely be disconnected from sexual attraction, or who I wanted to bed. She told me that it was possible for me to be biologically female, mentally and emotionally male, and attracted to females, which would make me straight. This blew my mind. I trusted her because she was older and a Real Lesbian(tm) but what she was saying didn’t make sense to me. Didn’t words like gay and straight have literal meanings? Shouldn’t they?!\n\nSome lesbians I knew started transitions. Most of our friends were confused and hurt as our group fractured. I tried comforting, I toed the line, I was all inclusive. I was trying so hard to understand and accept all of this. As a bisexual person I felt duty bound to stay open minded.\n\nI kept trying to figure out exactly why, and whether, I wanted to change myself from female into even the closest approximation of a man as medical science would allow. Slowly, ever so slowly, it dawned on me. The problem wasn’t me. The problem was living in a world dominated in every way by men. I hated “being a woman” only because I hated the way women are treated in every facet of society. I hated the way men acted, the way men treated me, the way they abused me casually in the workplace, all of it. I finally started reading feminist stuff online without shame, to see what all was being talked about by the women I had always passively made fun of. I was in a relationship with an abusive man when I read The Politics of Housework for the first time and it was like firecrackers went off in my mind. \n\nI found some radfem sites that talked about all PIV sex being rape and became overwhelmed. I wasn’t sure I agreed, but I had to see if there was a way out of the crushing depression that was smothering me now. I wrote one of these prominent radfems an email and said, “I have a question. If all of this is true, how do you get up in the morning every day and not want to just die? How do you deal with this knowledge every moment of every day that you’re just some not-even-human object slave entity according to half the population of the planet? How can you possibly make peace with all of this?” I was hoping she would have some advice, some sage wisdom to help me live with this crushing weight. \n\nShe wrote back. “You don’t.” That was her entire email.\n\nI spent about five years in excruciating depression after that. Yet, I became elated when the “Nice Guys(tm)” thing came out in the open around 2007(?). I was super excited when men, actual MEN, started writing feminist ally blogs and it seemed like they GOT IT. And finally, I realized I didn’t really want to BE a man. I wanted to stop being the thing that a society ruled by men made women into. And that was what was behind my curiosity about transition. I realized that transitioning wouldn’t ever stop it. I tried to just hang on; I happily waited for these changes, these shifts, to keep coming. I felt hope.\n\nA few years after Livejournal went out of fashion I tried looking up the transguys I’d been following for all those years. I only found one, still male, still apparently happy and doing trans activism. A few of my former online friends had committed suicide. A few were just totally gone, accounts and YouTubes and blogs and photo pages deleted. I found one guy making transguy jackoff porn behind a paywall. He looked incredibly sad. I started seeing a few Detransition blogs pop up here and there. I read with growing horror what transition had done to those young people. I started feeling gratitude that I’d never made the jump myself.\n\nI finally found the strength to end my abusive relationship with a supposed “woke” and “feminist” man. It dawned on me that men could pretend to be feminists as a smokescreen to justify abusing women. I realized that a lot of the ally men I was following weren’t really allies. Then Incels became a thing. Elliot Rodger happened. And suddenly “transphobia” was EVERYWHERE. Words don’t mean things anymore. Women’s reproductive rights are being disintegrated. Men are literally appropriating femaleness and telling us that our lived experiences aren’t valid. And trans kids? I can’t even with that. I WAS one of those non gender conforming kids. I feel like I’m in a nightmare I can’t wake up from. My newfound hope and the pleasure I felt at the progress we’ve made the past few years has been decimated, and it’s happened very quickly.\n\nI’m not just peak trans; I’m peak everything men. I feel exhausted by them and kind of sorry for them and pretty grossed out by them, even as I know I’d maybe still be a tiny bit hopeful if a non misogynistic unicorn showed up. I hang out with mostly gay men these days, if I hang with men at all, because their misogyny is at least straight in your face. I don’t date that often, because I don’t know any lesbians who feel like I do about these issues (most of them say they’re just not political, which perplexes me).\n\nAnd the vocal trans female contingent? These men violently seizing femaleness at the expense of biological women? They actively scare me. The trans men I’m still in contact with don’t. It’s like they carry the awareness of having been female with them into their male lives and they are sensitive and respectful. The trans females mostly just keep acting like men have always acted and it’s gross.\n\nI come here to read, so I don’t feel like I’m losing my mind. Writing this post here is the first time I’ve ever put these thoughts about my private twenty year journey down anywhere. I am terrified for the young people who are making critical life-altering decisions that didn’t have the luxury of twenty years of thinking first. I know this post has been too long and kind of all over the place, so if you finished it... thanks.', '[deleted]', 'Sorry this is so long! I just needed to get it all out. My peak, like I think a lot of people\'s was, was the 2017 Women\'s March.\n\nWhen I was in high school/college in the late aughts/early 2010s, ""transgender"" was a non-issue. It never cropped up in my classes or my irl social circle. It just wasn\'t a THING.\n\nDuring that same time, trans issues as a subset of social justice WAS gaining momentum on my corner of Tumblr, which I\'d started using in 2012. I was only on the website for funny posts and fandom stuff, but generally I accepted a lot of the chanting mantra stuff (trans women are women! trans women are women!) at face value. I found a lot of the standard Tumblr social justice positions, especially on gender, to be a bit contradictory? Not so much at first......but over the years the arguments kept getting more and more convoluted and confusing. Gender was somehow fake AND extremely, supremely important. A gifset of Laverne Cox saying that misgendering is ""an act of violence"" went around, and I thought.....okay, that seems like a *bit* much...but I tried not to think about it.\n\nIt bothered me a little bit, but mostly I was able to just ignore it because it seemed wholly contained within Tumblr. It just didn\'t seem real enough (to me) to bother upsetting myself about. So what if people on the internet are seemingly obsessed with the nebulous concept of gender identity? I\'ve never met anyone like that in real life. Trans people just want to pee! They just want to live their lives! Of COURSE I support that! Of course I don\'t care which bathroom they use! \n\nI purposely avoided thinking about any of the larger implications of trans ideology because I was terrified of uncovering ""transphobia"" within myself. The word ""terf"" had begun cropping up more and more in the online discourse—the first time I saw it, I had to look it up because I had absolutely no idea what it meant—and I didn\'t want to be Like That. I\'d never MET a ""terf,"" had never even come across one online, but they must be pretty bad because of all these increasingly frequent posts about how terfs are evil and MUST be blocked on site. I didn\'t really get it, but I knew I didn\'t want that to be me. So I just nodded along. Didn\'t reblog any of the gender stuff, but didn\'t seek out alternative viewpoints either. (In my weak defense, most normal people weren\'t talking about trans stuff at the time, and so it seemed like the only two schools of thought out there were The Tumblr Position, and like, far-right pundits. I definitely disagreed with the latter, so.......)\n\nThen a few things happened in the span of a few months. \n\n1) The IMMEDIATE backlash to the Women\'s March in January 2017 was the first big blow. Within hours of getting home from my city\'s march, I was reading long Tumblr posts about how the march itself was problematic, and how transphobic the signs that mentioned uteruses/ovaries/abortion/reproductive rights were. I became extremely agitated (what, so a WOMEN\'S MARCH can\'t include references to women\'s rights or anatomy? I know that in practice most of those marches were more anti-Trump marches than about WOMEN per se, but come on...) but couldn\'t express why TO any of my online friends, because I was worried that my distress was just a result of my privilege/latent transphobia/white feminism. I ended up deleting my entire blog that I\'d had for 5 years because I just couldn\'t take the cognitive dissonance anymore. I couldn\'t talk to anyone, I felt guilty about my wrongthink, and I just needed a break. \n\n2) I realized I was a lesbian, started using a dating app to talk to other women, and for the first time encountered ""trans girls"" in the real world. To put it bluntly.....they were men. I\'d assumed the majority of transwomen were just like normal women, but these were DUDES. The weird photo angles. The knee socks. The anime interests. They were all ""kinky."" These were transwomen in their OWN WORDS. I felt repulsed.\n\n3) I eventually made a new Tumblr blog (just couldn\'t take the misogyny on reddit anymore, and even the subs that I\'d one lurked on like r/ twox now seemed to be weirdly.....male-focused?), accidentally (really!) followed a lesbian ""terf"" blog, was initially horrified by my mistake, kept reading, kept reading......kept reading..........and the rest is history. Everything fell into place at once. My frustration with the constant accusations of transphobia over innocuous stuff, my discomfort with the idea of ""transmisogyny"" (how are men the real victims of misogyny??), the way I found BDSM and most online ""sex positivity"" repellant, my genuine consternation over how prostitution (or rather, ""sex work"") was ""empowering."" Everything suddenly made sense. \n\nI\'m not brave enough to express any of my radfem views to any of my irl liberal friends, but maybe one day. Sorry for the long rant! Reading all of the posts in this thread has been.....well, sort of depressing, but also weirdly hopeful? Everyone has found their own way here, and I think that\'s comforting.', 'It\'s a minor peak trans story, but I\'ll share it anyway.\n\nContext: in my country, gender dysphoria is regarded an illness and therefore, all treatment is paid for by the taxpayer (universal healthcare). In order to get said treatment, trans people need to see a doctor/psychologist for one session of counselling so the doctor says okay, you\'re trans, here\'s your medical statement for the health care provider, good luck with your surgery.\n\nThat, of course, is seen as being deeply insulting by the trans community. An article in a big national newspaper dealt (sympathetically) with their latest demand, namely, that gender dysphoria shall not be regarded as an illness (but as a way of life), but the treatment shall be still paid for by the taxpayer. They want their surgeries and hormonal treatment on request, no doctor involved. So I commented online that you can\'t have the cake and eat it: either gender dysphoria is an illness, then the health care provider is legally bound to pay for treatment, or it is not an illness, then the patients have to pay themselves. Because, seriously, if the health care providers are now obliged to pay for lifestyle choices, they might as well pay my upper thigh lift if I ever wanted one.\n\nYeah. Bad idea. Backlash of a lifetime! That woman who commented back (she called herself trans because she liked to wear baggy pants) called me every name in the book, put words in my mouth, insinuated I wanted to degrade, torture and kill her and every trans person in the world and with every comment, it got worse. She used a terminology which cannot be translated properly, but every German recognizes it as Nazi terminology, which is the worst insult you can use on a fellow German and a sure sign of someone who has run out of arguments. But it wasn\'t only her violent response that startled me. It was the eerie silence that accompanied it. That comment section is usually very lively, full of heated (but civilized) debate. Name-callers are usually rebuked pretty quickly. Not in this case. Nobody intervened. Nobody said anything. It was like she was entitled to her behaviour because, you know, trans.\n\nIn the next article, a TIM stated that he ""totally understood and comprehended the challenges a woman faced"", so he though it ""unfair"", that he, as an actor, never got to play female characters. That also went unchallenged by the journalist, despite the fact that said TIM had mentioned a few sentences ago how, for the very first time in his 40 years life, a stranger had sexually assaulted him by touching his buttocks in public, and how he, a six-foot-""woman"" had regarded his smaller attacker and concluded that he could ram that jerk into the ground. Totally an experience every woman can relate to, I\'m sure. And I was like: WTF? Seriously?? How can the journalist NOT ask a critical question like, let\'s say: ""Are you fucking serious? Are you slightly aware that most woman cannot ram their attackers into the ground and that your experiences as an able-bodies giant male are NOTHING like a woman\'s?""\n\nThat\'s when I started to research a little more and found out that many great thinkers whom I always thought highly of are now personae non gratae because the dare to think critically. I found out about male athletes who compete in women\'s tournaments, about males in women\'s spaces, about this whole silencing and erasure thing that is going on. That open debate is now called hate speech. That my experiences as born-and-raised female count for nothing. And I wondered how this whole thing totally passed me by. Why I never saw it for what it was.\n\nSo here I am.', ""So I'm a lesbian living in Ohio. Until recently, I have been pretty lenient about LGBT ideologies etc and how the community discusses transgender people. I am an intersex woman and bought into the bullshit that us intersex people belong in the umbrella (we don't!).\n\nThat brings us to yesterday where I met up with a 'woman' I'd come across on Tinder a couple of weeks ago. Until today, I felt guilty for not dating trans people and so gave it a go knowing full well that I am not into the male anatomy (this is the ideology being forced upon lesbian women).\n\nWe met up and guess what. This person did not look at ALL like the heavily edited and full makeup person that I saw on the app. HE had a week's worth of stubble, a man's voice and here's the biggest kick in the face - he wouldn't shut up about how great 'lesbianism' is (bear in mind that this asshole transitioned at age 24). I say asshole because he was one. He constantly asked about my periods, about my breast size and every time I would say I was uncomfortable, he'd tell me to remember that he too, is a woman.\n\nNo you aren't and you have no fucking idea what it's like to be a woman. And how fucking dare you use my intersex condition to validate 'gender identity' and your disgusting misogyny. I'm done so you know what, I WILL be putting that I'm only interested in biological females and if I get banned, so be it. I turned around after 10 minutes, blocked him and that's that."", 'I currently live in a very gay city that is really in love with the rainbow scene.  I was new to a friend group containing an elderly  TiM (2 yrs into the TiM process) that I first thought was just a cross dresser bc they sort of looked like a circus performer and werent making much of an attempt to pass and I thought oh that’s cool.  I thought they were just a fellow creative, but envelope-pushing.  When I learned they were a few months away from bottom surgery, I felt disappointed.  I thought it took so much more moxie to be a dude that did what they wanted, (like ewan macgregor wearing kohl) w/ no apologies instead of a guy pretending to be a woman like Silence of the Lambs. It read as somewhat creepy to me.  But I was going to give the BOTD to someone willing to cut their penis off.  \n\nAnyway.  The whole thing read strange to me.  I fought w/ everything I had to overcome the gender oppression of my youth, and being female just seemed like a fetish game to this person.  I don’t know why all of that appropriation is ok in these “woke” times.  \n\nLike their purse was a prop and their skirts were a costume.  Like when you see a little girl (not me lol), twirling their skirt for amusement.  Like she’s Liesl about to break into song about the joys of being 16? \n\nTiM always felt staged.  They’d make these real rehearsed sounding comments like “oh I just love taking off my bra at the end of a long day”, testing us out, seeing if we played along and acted like they were Just One of the Girls.  \n\nIt felt like I was trapped in the movie Sunset Boulevard w Norma Desmond.  A parallel reality I was forced to act out, or else.  This person was grotesque looking as far as feminine aesthetics were concerned, and it started to seem like they had a major preoccupation with the mannerisms and ideas about being a woman more than the cold hard realities.  Also they had what looked like a taste for super-young coeds w/ pert nips that never wore bras and worked at independent coffee shops.  They were “a lesbian”.\n\nI think I mini peaked when TiM wore a flimsy jersey knit skirt, no undies one day (pre op) and I could see the entire silhouette of their meat.   I was willing to chalk that up to my own character defects and social conditioning.  I guess there are people in other places that are more normalized to seeing sex organs at 8 am.\n\nTiM had enjoyed an entire life of white male privilege in a field dominated by white men.  Now that they were aging out/had no cache left in the world of men, I felt like they were opting in to the world of Transfemininity so they could be everybody’s darling.  An “act II”.  \n\nMy big peak was when this person went full on Single White Female with me, constantly repeating multiple times a day how much they enjoyed being around me; cataloguing everything I wore (“that t shirt is just so flattering on you”) pointing out the size of my feet (unfair! Your feet are so tiny!).  Continually texting me to “just let you know how much I miss you and how much I’d love to see you” long after I stopped showing up to friend group activities and replying to texts.  Sending messages through friend envoys telling me “TiM asked about you, they said hello”.  Finally I left the friend group.  I was the newest member so it seemed the obvious solution.  I guess it was TiMs super masculine seeming oblivious sense of entitlement to my space that made me peak...  I felt really Weinstein’d.  Only thing missing was a bath robe.  \n\nI genuinely feel bad for people who experience violence for expressing any manifestation of their identity.  I don’t want to contribute to anything that empowers someone to think they should be emotionally or physically violent against a T or persecute them in any way.  Fuck man.  I saw Boys Don’t Cry and I was wrecked.  I don’t think any stage of any person’s journey should make them a target of violence.  I’m not saying the world outside of trans people is categorically any healthier under the microscope.  But the censorship and oppression has just gotten crazy.  It’s like the emperors new clothes.\n\nIdk.  It all just feels crazy.  I made a throwaway to write this.  I still feel afraid I’ll somehow get doxxed.  If I ask in my Left leaning spaces why Rachel Dolezal gets burnt at the steak but trans people are the protected darlings of the community, I’m labeled a TERF and banned.  \n\nThis was nothing like Freddie redmayne in the Danish Girl! I guess the way my mother dying of cancer looked nothing like Debra winger in terms of endearment and more like something out of HBO Chernobyl.\n\nThis was my third “T” experience.  They were all similar to this.  Maybe I’m just getting bad apples.  Maybe it’s me! Maybe I attract the unhinged T’s.  I was cruising Drop the Tea the other day and all the vitriol was just violent and crazy and the whole thing feels like a race to the bottom and I don’t want to join the stampede.  There’s lots of stuff about life I don’t get, like why lesbians use dildos if they hate penises.  But no one is forcing me to get that.  I’m assuming lesbians wouldn’t get why I dig dudes w lots of chest hair.  I’m ok w them thinking that is undesirable.  Live and let live.\n\nI’m just looking for a respectful, non-violent place to hash all these things out.  Maybe I’m all the things they say.  Maybe I’m intolerant.  Am I? I am more on the spectrumy side and often don’t get other people’s thought-boxes.  Maybe I’m gatekeeping bc I had such a horrendous time of being an woman?\n\nI am sorry for all my analogies!!!!!!\n\nDo people actually read these? \n\nThanks for the safe space to vent.\n\nEDIT: don’t know how I forgot this, maybe bc it was so unpleasant.  Tim’s big day finally came for the snip snip.  It was all fun and games while the fentanyl lasted, but then they came home and just lit up my phone 24/7.  Having post-op complications they ignored, thought I was playing some fun flirty game (“lol, thanks mom!”) when I would tell them to get their shit checked by their dr, and, most of all BECOME FRIENDS WITH OTHER TIMS!!! Find out what their post-op experience is.  Why is it you want a straight woman w a vagina right now?  That was the weirdest part.  TiM seemed to hate other Tims.  Look man.  I am not your sex change concierge! I took care of two dying parents and I’m not here to take care of YOU!  The last call from TiM before I initiated the block sequence was a vm they left me from the psych ward a week after their “transition”. I felt truly slimed.  \n\nHonestly, it feels mean the way the lib and medical community bandies these people around like props, (like the movie Citizen Ruth with Laura Dern) and then spits them out to kill themselves after they are done with them.', 'I went to a leading university for gender and women’s studies. When I moved back to my hometown, I was “woke” as fuck, and met a transman who was into me (I presented as butch and thought I sounded edgy by identifying as queer). \n\nSaid transman, who I will call Spencer, attempted to start a sexual relationship with me, but I was a little skeptical on how that would work and told him I wasn’t comfortable with the idea. He continued to pursue. He asked to be my boyfriend. I said I wasn’t into heteronormativity, and really only wanted to date women. Spencer then proceeded to tell the entire lesbian community that I was a slut, a whore, straight, and transphobic. All because I rejected his advances. \n\nEven after that, I continued to see myself as an ally, and thought Spencer was an anomaly. \n\nI was part of a local GSA (they had changed it to mean Gender and Sexuality Alliance), and I helped put on a gender bender show. That’s where I met Chelsea. Chelsea was MTF who had not undergone any hormone therapy, she very much looked like a he, and would get angry if anyone “misgendered” her. My now wife and I did our best to take Chelsea in under our wings—we took her to a gay bar for her 21 birthday, helped her with clothes, and gave lots of support. It was a one-sided friendship, but my wife and I had always been fairly active in our community, and wanted to help the younger generation in any way we could. \n\nAbout six months after befriending Chelsea, I had posted as article on Facebook about sexism in classrooms, and wrote about my own experiences as a child. Chelsea commented that it was even harder as a trans child. Mind you, Chelsea did not start “transitioning” until she was 20, so until then, she presented as a boy throughout elementary school and high school. I pointed this out, and pointed out that she still benefited from male privilege until she started transitioning. Apparently, I was extremely transphobic for even suggesting that someone who was a boy, who looked like a boy, who liked girls, who was a middle class, white male christian could possibly have privilege from birth to 19 years old because they decided to transition at 20. \n\nThat was about eight or nine years ago. I recently looked Chelsea up, just to see what they are doing now. They use gender neutral pronouns, still looks like a middle class, white male christian, still dates only women, has not undergone any hormone therapy, and still identifies as a lesbian. \n\nI wasted years of my life trying to help the trans community and being an ally, and in return, I was vilified, called terrible names, and had my own journey as a woman discounted over the “trans plight.” \n\nI don’t think they are actually interested in having allies as much as they are interested in being victimized. I don’t even think they actually want to fix the situation. I think they absolutely enjoy considering themselves as victims.', 'The TIM who peaked me originally (a serial sex pest who’s now a “proud lesbian”) posted a comment the other day on an article about a prostitute getting killed -  something along the lines of how he was grieving her death because he’s been to a lot of sex workers and they’ve really made him feel validated on his journey to being a lesbian. \n\nMaybe a woman being brutally stabbed to death isn’t about your validation buddy!\n\nThere’s always more peak', ""Peak transing this weekend again. I was at a rest stop on a major American highway. A man was screaming and yelling at a woman half his size in front of dozens of witnesses. She was clearly terrified. She went into ladies room to escape the lunatic. He followed her still screaming and yelling despite the fact that he was in a public place. Half a dozen women left the room immediately obviously scared of this creep. As I dialed 9-11 to report him, I realized I had to pee but of course I couldn't go into the ladies room either because I was also terrified of this man. I have gone into the ladies room many times to get away from men being jerks.\n\nThis is why women's boundaries must be respected. The TIMs who argue that they have some sort of right of access to private female spaces because they are afraid of their fellow men should not seek to destroy our private refuges. If they are in danger, let them develop other ways of coping with male violence. It is profoundly tone deaf to ignore how women feel. It's also profoundly unfair to take away one of the few places most men won't go."", 'Sorry pretty graphic below....\n\nI peak transed years ago in college when I was confronted by a TiM (homeless..?on drugs..?) Prostitute. I did not have a car in nursing school, and couldn\'t afford a whole lot so I walked everywhere or rode the bus or carpooled with friends. I was getting off the bus and went to sit down on the bench at the bus stop to wait for the other bus going another direction. TiM strides up with clicking heels and a god awful pink and black cheetah print dress and costume jewelry. Obviously wearing a wig, two different heels on (lol..?) a ton  of makeup (not very well done, mind you), and smoking like  chimney. He looks god awful like he is on drugs, twitching, red blood shot eyes, smells of alcohol and feces and something dead, and kinda looks like Petunia from Futurama but much much worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe asks me for money for the bus and for cigarettes. I say nope, I don\'t have any money. He asks for drugs and other things next and I say no. He then thinks we are like bestie girlfriends, grabs my elbow and drags me on the bus. I push him off and tell him I don\'t want to be touched and sit in the back. He FOLLOWS me, sits down by me and traps me between the window and the aisle, and starts talking about how hard it is to be a prostitute... ok? I don\'t want to know! He asks personal questions like if I had a boyfriend, if i was a virgin, where I lived, where I worked... etc. And how apparently it was hard for him to ""succeed"" as a ""woman"" as well...lol ok. He told me how empowering it was to be a ""lady of the night"" and about how his ""John\'s"" were so kinky. I was uncomfortable with the topic and asked him to stop...nope he thought I was his friend...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ask to get up several times and try to see if anyone around would help me. Some people were staring at...his spectacle but didn\'t do anything! He proceeds to tell me about how he can\'t afford SRS and still has a penis. He realizes I\'m in nursing school and asks questions about STDs and problems with his stoma. I think to myself ""stoma...I thought he was just having anal/oral sex...???"" He fucking ELABORATES by lifting his dress (on the bus with at least 25 people in public), and shows me his colostomy/ileostomy bag. NSFW AHEAD NSFW GRAPHIC  BELOW WARNING!!! IT IS GROSS AND NOT MEDICALLY RECOMMENDED\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI fucking PANIC! It was like so so gross, necrotic, had drainage, all kind of colors, had stool, pus, bleeding, the bag was barely attached and I didn\'t want to fucking catch something from the drainage!!! That\'s were the smell came from! It was like something died!!! He apparently didn\'t want to be penetrated anally and let men stick their penises in the stoma...it got infected and something may have perforated (I\'m an RN now, but had not been one at the time). He asked if he had an STD...in the middle of his bowel. WTF!!!! I don\'t know?? Probably? This all happened within the span of like 30 seconds and I fucking screamed and pulled the stop cord above me and caused a riot. I told the driver to stop and wanted to get off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe tried to stop me and follow me because he liked to talk about ""girly"" shit, porn, and men. He was literally convinced I was his friend because I didn\'t outwardly tell him to fuck off (I\'m a compassionate person, felt bad for the poor/disadvantaged) Some dudes stopped him and I ran like hell and called my friends to pick me up. I have other irritating and demeaning things happen, but this was fucking disturbing and caused fucking nightmares.\n\nLater, when I had been working for several years, we had a patient (guy identifies as guy) who had the same thing, same symptoms, the docs were baffled at what the fuck was causing it.... I asked the dude if he was having sex (cringe) with the stoma as the orifice and he admitted it. I told the doctors and we all collectively hurled... So here we are today. So sorry about the graphic detail!! I just wanted to let you know the extent of heebie-jeebies he gave me! I never forgot this and it is etched into my fucking brain forever....\n\nEdit : A man is not a woman. A STOMA is not a substitute for a VAGINA. A ""neovagina"" (inverted penis or resected bowel) is also not a vagina. Wtf...? Does he charge extra or is it half off when guys PENETRATE the stoma instead...? *barf* I have nightmares..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of *sweet dreams are made of this...*\n\nIt\'s *nightmares are made of TiMs*', 'I think I really began to take a closer look at radfem after a very close friend of mine I had been friends with for over fifteen years decided they were non-binary after getting arrested for indecent exposure and decided she would be able to work it out as a case for her defense in court (she walked around topless very drunk on a public beach and eventually a family called the police) and she figured (as was explained to me during the whole thing) ""women can\'t walk around topless, but they don\'t say non-binary people can\'t!"" it didn\'t hold up in court but I was happy for my friend for deciding what she wanted to be at the time and supported them during the case and while I did honestly support the free the nipple moment, I was hurt when my friend told me out of the blue last year that because I was cis, we could no longer be friends as she was seeking to purge everyone who was cis from her life.

I even accused my grandparents of being transphobic when misgendering the trainwreck of a TiM that was my uncle’s boss (This TiM would throw temper tantrums and was basically mentally deranged as stated by my uncle).\n\n It happened when I was looking for RPDR interviews and I came across one where two trans contestants talked about their transitions and stuff. I remember one (Gia Gunn I think) saying something along the lines of “I knew I was female because being in drag felt so natural and I always felt sad whenever I got out of drag.” And for a minute I just thought...Does she really think that being a female is the same as doing drag? Is she really comparing females lives to a performance? It hit me really hard as I realized that the TiM in question felt that being a female and the oppression that comes with it is...just a performance akin to gluing on nails and wearing huge blonde wigs. Is that really all it takes?\n\nI had known what a ‘terf’ was previously so I decided researching some of the arguments and what'd ya know. Everything made sense."", 'A TiF my mum works with has had to take time off work due to ill health, apparently they were on the verge of having a stroke or heart attack and doctors think it\'s a result of the hormone treatment they\'re on, which I\'ve found quite alarming. \n\nMy sister, who\'s sex/porn critical but very libfem when it comes to trans issues erupted when I pointed out she\'s parroted the TRA line that transitioning hormones/puberty blockers are ""harmless"".\n\nThere really needs to be more research into these drugs and the negative side effects made more readily available. The TiF in question is only in their early 20\'s, had been undergoing hormone treatment for about 3 - 4 years.', 'Here with a new one... I was at a camping event this weekend and noted a ""queer"" campsite - a group of people attending the event who had put up a bunch of different flags. One was the old rainbow flag (yay!) one was a polyamory pi flag (uh) and the other was a trans flag.\n\nI didn\'t get a good look at the campers until one night when a few of them were out together. A young woman, possibly 18-19 but drinking heavily, being pulled left and right by a guy in his late twenties and a guy who kept snatching at her every time she stepped away. She wore a collar with a leash they were holding, and a waistband decorated with glo-sticks that the men were groping right in the open. Bad enough, but her two buds, a man in a dirty sundress with year old dye in his hair and his ""straight"" lover were hanging by, like it\'s totally acceptable for a couple of men to be fighting over a woman like a pair of kids harassing the family cat.\n\nSo that\'s another fucking harmful thing all of this has caused. In humane times I would have said, look, are these guys bothering you?

It was jarring, garish, grotesque, precisely what my friends had always told me trans people were not. If this was what womanhood truly felt like to this person and their friends, it wasn\'t something I could get behind. It was a mockery of our struggle and domestic slavery for millennia and our fight to be treated as humans, not objects. Women have died, not for the right to flounce around and advertise ourselves as sex objects but for the right to be recognized as fully fledged humans. Their perception of womanhood clearly did not agree with that concept. I was and still remain completely flabbergasted.

It got me through a lot of body anxiety and allowed me to ask sex questions in a safe environment. Then, at some point, they began to capitulate to this ""nonbinary"" woman who raised hell on every single post that equated female organs with women. It was relentless. There was fighting between much of the women there regarding whether or not we should police language that has to do with our bodies. It even bled over into the separate VP group just for raising inquiries with mods. I haven\'t been there in several years, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if some of that still remained.\n\nAnyway, I remember being incensed that some woman who didn\'t want to be called a woman effectively created an environment where women had to walk on eggshells when asking deeply personal, sometimes fear filled questions about their bodies.

This was sudden, and clearly a social contagion, I-want-to-be-part-of-this-cool-group thing.  This boy had never ever shown any interest in being a girl.

For those who are not familiar with it, it\'s a form of electric-guitar based music and often associated with leftist politics. As almost everywhere in the left, the dominant form of feminism here is liberal feminism/queerfeminism, which is annoying.\n\nLast year, I visited Vancouver/Canada and went to a local punk show there, in a self-organized/collectively run anarchist venue. This space seems to have the typical\xa0subcultural leftist\xa0safe\xa0space policy of wanting to be very inclusive and also having norms about behavior/opinions that are not tolerated there.\xa0\n\nI didn\'t know the bands before. One of the local bands playing (their last ever show) had a transwoman as a singer. This person is probably involved in the collective of the space, because they\xa0were making announcements before about a lottery or something for the benefit of the venue. The band started its show with the singer dressed in a negligé, which they then took off after the first song, performing totally naked\xa0 (had breasts, was probably on HRT). The dick was also visible, the fucking whole time. But it went worse. Not only did they intentionally cut themselves,\xa0so blood was running over their body, but\xa0they did some\xa0sexualized acts, such as putting\xa0finger in their ass. They also made really strange announcements that sounded as if they were either on drugs or having mental issues (or both), such as: ""All the trans people in the audience should kill themselves!""\n\nI found the whole show very disturbing and felt uncomfortable. But I stayed until the end, also because I wanted to observe how the audience reacted. Nobody seemed to be obviously bothered or disgusted.\n\n\xa0I didn\'t see any point in complaining afterwards also, because I would have just blamed to be transphobic, and also as the singer seemed to be involved in the venue.\xa0\n\nIf this person would not identify as trans, and a ,cis\'-guy would have done the same thing, he would be thrown out directly and it would be a huge scandal. But because this person identifies as a (trans)\xa0woman it is appearantly seen as brave and progressive. But for me, it was offensive.\n\nI have nothing against nudity and even seeing dicks also in other then private sexual contexts, but\xa0only when I know before, that this is happening/could happen and can chose if I want to be confronted with it. And I am all for freedom of art to a certain degree and I know at a punk-show non-conventional stuff can happen. But here I was totally unprepared, and it was way too much. In a community, where trigger warnings etc. are sometimes even used inflationary I found it very contradictory, that there was no advise beforehand. What if someone is a survivor of sexual violence, and doesn\'t want to see a dick in front of her?\nThis is NOT a safe space for women!\xa0\n\nI feel more and more alienated from the punk-community, but still the music is really important to me.

As a result of this event UN Women has decided to no longer focus on women but to work for the ""equality of all genders"" instead. The audience was told that centering gender needs to be put ""in the DNA of the UN"" (lol) and one speaker told the mainly heterosexual audience, ""We are more than you, and essentially you need to learn how to become a bit more like us.""  Women were told they were just a blip  somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum.

It\'s gotten to the point where I ask for, say, a list of women who participated in GDQ (a speedrunning event) and I get a list consisting entirely of TIMs, with not a single natal female in sight. If I ask if there are any natal women - even including TIFs - involved, I immediately get the cold shoulder for invalidating the TIMs. It\'s such a pervasive problem in these communities that if you assumed any given ""woman"" was a TIM you\'d be right a vast majority of the time, and there\'s no real way to find the other natal women because there\'s no way to ask that question without insulting the TIMs who outnumber and are more visible than me.\n\nI just don\'t understand how trans people and their supporters just don\'t get WHY, in any profession or hobby, natal women might want to see and support other natal women. I don\'t seek out natal women because I want to see feminine people succeed - I do it because sometimes I get very tired of being a woman in a culture that actively holds back and discourages women from gaining success and visibility, and seeing successful women keeps me going, and being able to support other women is important to me.\n\nIt really angers me when I see something like ""the first woman to win the hacking competition"" or ""the first woman to rank top 100 in this competitive activity"" only to find out that the woman is actually a TIM. So...there\'s still no first woman then, huh? A vast majority of obstacles women face in society are based on incorrect assumptions about our biology (ex: ""women are too emotional because of their ovulation cycle"" of ""only men have the drive to succeed because blahblah evolutionary psychology""), not because of our gender presentation.

(They date women and punish them bc they arent women)\n\nThis is a mental illness and the fact that the WHO doesnt think so is insane.', ""For me it came gradually. I am in my early 30's and in my very late teens/early 20's I hung out with some male cross dressers/transgenders and some became close friends (met them through the goth/fetish scene). No problems with them at all, they were lovely people with, in my view, a reasonable attitude towards their cross dressing, identity, or transition. However, about 10 years later trans people were all over the media, social media made it much easier to share and be exposed to all kinds of stories from across the globe, and trans activists seemed to get much more of a platform and/or just become more vocal/aggressive. Demanding you use whatever pronoun they want that day, demanding that you not only tolerate them but accept them, embrace them, date them, and shutting down anyone who does not 100% believe in their ideology/world view/identity. More over, denying science (I am a STEM scientist). Insisting that a penis can be a woman's or female organ, and then there's self-ID. This, but maybe also just me growing up more, has made me much more reserved and negative towards trans people as a group, despite having been very open, accepting, and tolerant in the past. I have no problem with a male who cross dresses when he goes clubbing, or a male wanting to live as a woman full time. But you do not get to dictate that I use whatever pronouns you want, and you do not get to self-ID for legal purposes so that you can demand access to women's spaces (or men's spaces if you are an ftm). I am also very angry at the fact that intersex or trans women are allowed to compete against female women in sports because this is clearly unfair. And then there's the whining of trans women that nobody wants to date them and that it's not them that are the problem, but it's everyone else. The image of the typical trans person now, in my eyes, is a self-absorbed entitled whiny professional victim (sometimes also a predator). They seem unhinged, totalitarian, and aggressive. I am sure this applies only to a few, but sadly they are very vocal and visible in the media (again, probably because of social media).\n\nThen there's ROGD and it not being possible to objectively study trans anything for fear of threats, negative press, or being called a trans phobe. As a scientist, this is especially ridiculous and telling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: The fact children are being put on blockers and cross-sex hormones without adequate research into whether this is good medicine or not, and without a good diagnostic process, is appalling and child abuse."", 'I keep thinking that I\'ve peaked, and then something else happens. Part of my office processes name change petitions. We had a TWELVE YEAR OLD come in with her mother to change her name to a boy\'s name. TWELVE. They asked about getting the gender marker changed on the birth certificate. Not our office - and our state does require that surgery be completed first. The kicker? The parent is a fucking OB/GYN. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA past classmate of my daughter\'s switched schools last year because they wouldn\'t honor her new preferred him/his pronouns. Nevermind that this kid had already pushed every single rule that the (private, religious) school had in place, with her parent\'s encouragement, up to dyeing her hair a billion fucking colors. I swear I could watch this poor kid\'s mental illness progress on her mother\'s social media. Her mother is a WOKE, libfem to the max and this new trans child is her crown jewel. Kid has gone through four different names in nine months and god forbid you call her the wrong name, or misgender her when she\'s wearing a skirt and hoop earrings - you\'d better know she\'s a boy now. Honestly, some of this pre-teen gender crap reminds me of the who can be the most punk (who\'s punk, what\'s the score) of years past. Except that our parents just ignored it and rolled their eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can practically predict which of my old schoolmates\' kids will be the next to trans - whatever happened to ""okay wear a dress paint your nails throw a football who cares"" - why are they now enforcing those gender roles even more strictly than OUR PARENTS twenty five years ago???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies if anything came out as offensive.', 'My peak trans story is when my ex girlfriend told me that some women can have dicks. To me, that’s just ridiculous. She also said that she is too lesbian to be attracted to dicks. Well aren’t all lesbian NOT attracted to dicks? \n\nTo deny that women have vaginas is sexist. Women have fought so hard to not being seen as their genitals. We have fought so hard to have our own spaces and our own divisions in sports. \n\nI’m so sick of these MtF trans people who claim that they are not trans due to shallow gender roles but then state the very reason why they are trans is because they like pink and to wear makeup. A man wearing makeup and a dress is still a man. A woman who wears a suit and Oxford shoes is still a woman. Your hobbies, clothing of choice do not determine your gender. Your chromosomes do. Ffs I enjoy doing martial arts. Does that make me any less of a woman. No it doesn’t! \n\nAlso even if a trans woman had genital surgery, it does not look like a vagina and will never. He still has the bone structure of a man which makes it really fucking unfair for women who compete against trans women. Oh yeah and also men tend to be twice as stronger in their upper bodies compared to women on average. Even if trans women took medication to suppress their testosterone production, it wouldn’t be fair in sports to let them compete against women. \n\nI’m so damn sick of this trans ideology. I’m so sick that men who feel like women get to compete in women’s sports, get women’s scholarships etc. It’s downright misogynistic. I’ve lost a few friends and I broke up with my gf due to them thinking that some women have dicks.\n\nAlso one last thing, here in Sweden doctors let 14 year old girls to have surgery to remove their breasts because they feel like men. These poor girls often suffer from autism, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and suffered sexual abuse. To me letting a 14 year old girl doing this irreversible surgery is pure child abuse. In 50 years we will look back with horror on what we did to the most vulnerable people of the society. We will look back on this just like we look back on the horrific experiments in psychiatry in the 20th century today. The psychiatry must not let repeat its dark history. These poor girls need therapy and medications, maybe even being hospitalised if their mental health issues are really severe. Not letting them mutilating themselves because they hate themselves. \n\nThis post is all over the place but yeah, it shares my peak trans stories.', 'My latest peak was reading comments on a terrible plastic surgery subreddit.  There was a TIM who’d had dermal fillers injected by an unlicensed hack, that caused awful damage to his face.  Very sad, but he managed to get plastic surgery to fix it.  What peaked me was in the comments. Someone was (rightly) saying how awful this was, but then said that trans women were taken advantage of, because they needed surgery to become their true selves. WHAT?!?  And then there were other people apologising in the comments, and basically acknowledging this opinion as a literal fact.  Your true self is a man, dear.', 'I just saw that an old acquaintance claims the snapchat gender filters convinced her she needed to begin HRT (after identifying as ""queer and genderqueer"" for a few years now) because she loved the way the more masculine features made her look. \n\nYet, two weeks later she was at pride in a tank that said \'DYKE\' in big, bold lettering.

I still prefer to wear men's clothes. That does not obviate my femaleness. Still, I was unthinkingly supportive of the trans movement. I reckoned that was just part of being on the liberal left.\n\nOne day while tooling around on the Internet I found a PDF of Anne Lawrence's book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism and my eyes were opened."", 'In all honesty, I am a bit new to all this. My life philosophy  is I support everyone in their right to live their life as they please as long as they don\'t seek to harm others. And for the longest time, while I didn\'t understand it, I supported trans rights because from afar, it fit within my ideology. However, it always bothered me how many TIMs presented with this warped,fetishized, flamboyant, stereotypical female facade. I am a  woman but my passions are powerlifting( a sport I compete in), combatives, shooting, hunting, and I train gundogs. All typical ""masculine"" endeavours. My passions and interests in no way affect my identity. I grew up a tomboy, and to this day, I still am but I am a woman and proud of it. \nWhen I see comments along the lines of equating wearing a dress or makeup to being a woman, it bothers me. The clothes I wear do not make me a woman, my experiences in life and my biology do. It is accepted that gender is a sociological norm that we establish, but if one isn\'t raised as a woman, how does one know what it is to be a woman?\nI would no more assume to be African American, Native American, or a man because my life was not affected by the societal norms/prejudice/ and other unique encounters that these individuals face. A transwoman will have experiences a transwoman has, but that does not mean they have lived as a woman.\nAnd my reproductive organs? I don\'t really think about them too often. They aren\'t in any way something I adore or focus on, but they have shaped a part of my life from the pain and discomfort of periods to the extra precautions I have to take to avoid pregnancy. Hell, they even get thrown into the political arena when it comes to pregnancy and abortions. If you have been a man half your life, what would you know about that?\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I would have been able to keep these musing to myself, because I don\'t enounter TIMs often, but when I see articles where TIMs want it banned to discuss whether TIMs are women in philosophy class rooms I am aghast. Philosophy questions everything, from religion to the reason we exist, one does not get to be excluded because of your feelings. One can\'t even have a conversation that questions any facet of the transgender movement without being shut down or attacked as transphobic. Hell, they even go after your livelihood. There is no logical discussions to be had, you either accept everything they have to say or you are the enemy. I see it every day now, and I realized this is more than just being allowed to live the way they want to live. TIMs want to control what it means to be a woman and control the narrative. And if they have to invalidate every natural born female along the way that\'s fine.\n\nSo thank you for a space that isn\'t afraid to go against the status quo and speak up because finding this place helped validate everything I felt. It helped me formulate my own feelings and thoughts on the matter.', ""I didn't think I peaked but I realized I did. TIFs who kept saying they're such gay men made me peak. They're very prominent in fandoms and it was just so... off. I see a 100% female insisting her male boyfriend is 100% homosexual and not because their relationship is a cover up so his homophobic family won't know or something. That was too absurd."", 'Love this sub. This isn’t my peak story (I’ll write that soon) but just wanted to share a minor annoyance. A TIM “lesbian” coworker I follow on Instagram did a meme scolding his audience for asking his “preferred pronouns”. We shouldn’t say “preferred” we should just ask “what are your pronouns?” Also last year he said he “got frustrated when people ask his preferred name” because he still went by his birth name. \n\nThis pisses me off because at this point we literally have to be PSYCHIC to figure out what is proper protocol to act around these entitled males. It’s almost like they are setting us up for failure (“cis” people and especially “cis” women) so they can berate and scold us and tell us how dumb we are. Where have a heard this before? Oh yeah it’s the tale as old as time.', 'I’ve been here for a few months, but never shared my story so here:\nI’m a lesbian and I’ve always been politically liberal, so I always supported the T in LGBT without thinking much about it. After coming out, I wanted to understand my “community” better and I finally went to an ask trans sub to ask a few questions that I didn’t quite understand. I asked something along the lines of why changing gender is necessary as opposed to just being GNC and quickly got called transphobic when I had clearly stated that I was only trying to understand and not hurt anybody. That wasn’t even peak for me because it only made me believe that there was just something I wasn’t getting still. It wasn’t until AL (the main lesbian sub) became almost all about “girl dick”. Any post that referenced sex with vaginas had a comment like “what about girl dick” “I love my gfs girl dick” etc. Finally somebody posted a lesbian youtubers video that was against girl dick and all of the comments were very against the video ([this is the link](https://youtu.be/9D_lK8cwmgg)). I watched the video thinking it was going to be super bigoted, but agreed with all of it. I then decided to go to the truelesbians sub and eventually explored here out of curiosity. I agreed with so much and was so shocked by just how bad this issue is.', 'I peaked a couple of years ago after radfem pins started showing up on my Pinterest recommended page. Ignored them at first because I was vehemently libfem and couldn’t stand seeing an opposing opinion (what a shock), but the more I averted my eyes, the more I became drawn in by Actual Smart Ideas and Critical Thinking (wow!). Pretty soon after being exposed to radfem ideas, I was sucked in completely. The thing that really hit me that pushed me over was the idea that TIMs will never sexually assault women in bathrooms. Like the thought is appalling because when talking about anything at all, rarely do things never happen? Like letting a male into a female space is never gonna result in anything bad ever just because Uwu he identifies as female so he’s lost ALL of his male privilege? Libfems love to play the “Oh men get raped too!” card and the “Women sexually assault too!” card, but this TIM will never ever assault a woman you transphobes! If trans women are women, then shouldn’t the “Women sexually assault too” apply to them as well? Transgender ideology has so many holes in it that the only way to believe in it is not to think about anything they say at all.', ""I have peaked again!

Since he's a man, Nick should not be referred to as 'she'.  If they'd done proper research, they would know that Nick is anti-feminist, anti-female, and a caricature of femininity, hardly someone teenagers should look to as a bastion of online sanity. What they should really do is check out Gender Critical Reddit or any other radical feminist site, understand how people like Contrapoints are actually serving to radicalize people into believing that changing sex is 'valid' and the radical feminists are evil. I'm appalled, and I'm going to let them know. I'll also let them know that I'm definitely not contributing because of all the lib-fem trans content they've had lately and may stop listening altogether if they continue to trot out fake women who are a rebuke and an insult to all natal women.

She has felt over the past several years that she wasn’t able to be connected to things like that anymore - like she wasn’t allowed because it’s “gender essentialist”. And I kind of wonder what trans people would say about that. Is she not allowed to feel empowered through connecting to this story and to the history that women have been a part of? And through the sacred body of woman? It’s kind of strange. That because trans people want to have a certain relationship to body, other people have to adopt that as well in order to be good allies...? I’m not sure if it’s a correct assessment.

That’s changed now thanks to people who believe that in an effort to accommodate people’s “dysphoria” there needs to be a complete erasure of female biology and womanhood. So I’m making an effort to become an active feminist. I feel so dejected that the rights and spaces my Mother and Grandmother fought for (equal pay, women’s sports funding, pre and post natal mental health care to name a few they were personally involved in) are being so casually eroded, and it’s made me realise that we have never had the “equality” we thought we had. It has all come falling down around us because biological males have decided that they want to be female, and they want to force their way into not just female spaces, but vulnerable female spaces, despite knowing that they are physically stronger than us. \n\nI’m a woman who has worked very closely with women fleeing male violence, including sex trafficked women and children. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t sit back and quietly watch as these women are forced to accommodate biological males, who’s only qualifier for being there is that they “feel like a woman inside”. In my country, the government has just recently paused plans to legitimise self identification. The Government minister (female) who was brave enough to go against her party and speak out in an effort to stop it has been subject to some of the worst vitriol that I’ve seen. I’ve had enough. I’m angry. I feel politically homeless. I’m no longer welcome in the left wing spaces I held so dear to my heart because I refuse to accept that people should be allowed to self identify and immediately have access to women only spaces and resources. I just can’t with these people anymore. I’m a Socialist who apparently has no place in the left because although I’m heterosexual, I’m a strong supporter of gay rights and am horrified to see my lesbian sisters being branded as phobic bigots because they refuse to have sex or relationships with biological males with penises.\n\nJust to make it clear, I have no quarrel with pragmatic trans people. I completely acknowledge that some of them genuinely go through hell living in their bodies. As much as I don’t believe you can be born into the wrong body, I do believe that a tiny number of people suffer from a disorder that makes them believe that they have been. I want to support and empathise with them, but not at the expense of women’s rights, not at the expense of biological reality, and most of all not when supporting them leaves the door wide open for men who fetishise women to have control of us and our resources. It seems that this is impossible though. If you dare to question anything about their demands you’re dismissed as a “terf” and told you don’t deserve a voice. So be it then. \n\nAnyway, I’m sorry for rambling. I was gonna open a side account to comment here after seeing the way GC people are chased around reddit by “TRA’s” but fuck it, we need to be unafraid because this shit has gone too far. We need to let these online ideologies see how many real world people have had enough.', 'I have just realized I\'ve been posting to this sub without sharing my peaktrans story. Where are my manners?\n\nMy peaktrans moment was: girldick. Consider that the TL;DR version, anyhow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I will go into more depth, as I feel it is necessary to truly grasp the full peak I experienced. After all, there was a set of circumstances that brought me to the aforementioned neo-religious rebuke of well established science. There was a ton of incendiary substances all ready to blow from the sparks thrown in my mind that girldick lit.\n\nTo preface this story, I\'ve never been involved with LGBTQ+3.14∞ groups online. The closest I came was a long abandoned attempt to connect with asexuals on AVEN and ace-book, like, ten years ago before they were even in the acronym. I haven\'t gotten any of my beliefs or opinions off of the internet. You could call me a bad millennial as I\'ve always had an aversion towards social media. Part of it was being so sensitive; what you\'d call an ""empath"" I suppose. Another was feeling like there is no point to it as things change so rapidly. I also have an abnormal attention span and sense of time, so you can imagine that my productivity was at stake as well. So I did not experience any indoctrination of any kind from social media. The only form of indoctrination I had came from being devoutly liberal because, well, I like being free and able to make my own choices and define myself. As a female born woman who grew up GNC there was no better option anyway.\n\nFor most of my self-aware existence, I have wanted to transition into a man. I realize now that it wasn\'t because I actually thought I was one, but because I wanted to be able to be myself without harassment for one reason or another. Be a feminine woman and face unwanted sexual advances; be a masculine woman and be ridiculed. Vice versa or both can happen. So you can imagine how transition would come naturally to me. I don\'t think I have a single feminine cell in my body. Everything I\'m interested in or do and all of my mannerisms are what you\'d call masculine.\n\nI abhorred everything about living as a woman in this world. I\'m a simple person. I don\'t want special treatment. I just want to be left alone, and being a woman is made out to be all about others besides you. I grew weary of being restricted and othered way more than my brother of similar age before I even hit puberty. I never completely came out as trans to my family because of bad altercations in the past involving me calling myself a boy. You would think that would lead me to seeking approval online, but I just knew I would be attacked and ridiculed as I\'d been my whole life. I guess I was under the impression that the internet was mostly right leaning, or at least unwelcoming to a woman who thinks she\'s a man. \n\nI instead continued living in my little progressive bubble; thinking people who thought gender ID laws were dangerous were a bunch of religious boomers. If you asked me point-blank last year if TWAW, I would\'ve answered with my own personal dogma about my experiences with ""being in the wrong body"" and how you are clueless and causing severe harm to suggest that TW aren\'t women. Becoming a man was so true to me that I didn\'t question its inevitability, well that is until just over two months ago.\n\nI wish I remember what it was exactly that made me start to question asexuality, but in a most absurdly poetic way, I began questioning how I really felt about sexuality just in time for pride month. Maybe it was the queerness in the air, or crippling loneliness, but I felt compelled for the first time since declaring myself asexual to explore lesbianism. See, I knew deep down that I had always fancied women somehow. I wasn\'t sure how to describe it, but being around women was different. Since I already ""knew"" I was asexual, I thought there was no point in looking further into these visceral feelings because my dating pool was going to be microscopic. Most women wanted sex, and I didn\'t. I had all but declared I would be alone forever. It seemed like I was creating a self-fulling prophecy. How did I never question why I thought if I had a partner she\'d have to be a biological woman? Why does her biology matter if I really don\'t want sex? Well I guess I eventually got around to it.\n\nI ended up going through a frustrating sequence of searches trying to figure myself out. In the midst of it, I came across a selfie post in a lesbian sub that was clearly a man. I searched the comments for anyone as bothered by this as I was. Absolutely no one took issue with it. I couldn\'t understand how men were allowed to post in this group. I decided that perhaps *somehow* I was in the wrong place, so instead of lashing out with questions I went to another sub. And then another sub. And another, until I eventually found myself on GC by following a linked chain of complaints about men claiming to be women, and therefore lesbians; some even without trying to transition. From there it was down the rabbit hole that is gender ideology and how much it has grown in influence and control these past few years. I would\'ve never believed it to be this bad. It was like I walked on to a psychological thriller movie set. Gender is a hell of a gateway drug.\n\nNeedless to say, despite knowing nothing about lesbians, and never having been in a relationship with another woman, I felt instinctively repulsed by the idea of anyone with male biology claiming to be one. I knew I questioned my ace identity because I was comfortable with and drawn to intimacy with someone who is a biological woman. I dropped my logically unfounded reasons to transition after realizing what kind of nonsense and real harm the ideology was pushing (especially after I found the detransitioner stories). Besides, I now knew that there was nothing wrong with being a masculine woman, and that there\'s plenty of others like me here to support me. I can never literally be a man, and I don\'t have to anyway. I\'m not going to be a coward and throw away a perfectly fine and authentic butch lesbian identity for a fake cishet man identity that I would likely regret.', 'I hit peak trans after seeing a Youtube video of an obvious male screaming at a lesbian about how she\'d better show trans people some respect at NYC Dyke March, years ago. I think that woman was some kind of a big deal radfem, but I don\'t remember her name.  I expected the comments (this was on a forum, not YT directly) to be on the lesbian\'s side, given the context but when I saw that the majority of people commenting on the incident were praising this male for being brave and standing up to oppression, it was like that ""these white men are dangerous"" picture from Pocahontas just materialised in my mind, and I\'ve never been able to unsee it. Every time I see a TIM opine on anything that\'s none of his goddamn business (like lesbianism or abortion), that\'s all I see. \n\nI had been totally supportive of the T until that moment, never questioned their motives, because it seemed natural to me for people to be gender non conforming and I\'d never heard of any of the insane parts of gender discourse until then -- the cotton ceiling, ""trans lesbians"", etc, because in the circles where I hung out, the subjects just never came up, and any opposition to transgender ideology was just by default considered violent transphobia and not given any airplay whatsoever. \n\nThe thing that I noticed immediately about radical feminists was that they didn\'t try to force their ideas onto anyone; they didn\'t come into trans spaces and demand audiences, they just wrote their articles and essays about various aspects of female oppression on their own websites/blogs. When those articles would get shared/disseminated, TRAs would immediately show up in the comments screaming about how talking about female biology was literal violence, even though they a) lacked female biology and b) no one invited them or asked for their opinions. None of them ever seemed to be aware that women writing blog posts in secluded corners of the internet actually had no bearing on the material reality of transgender people. It didn\'t matter that radical feminists have been largely sidelined, when not outright ridiculed, in the era of male-pleasing sex positive choose my choices liberal feminism. Rather than try and work with women to try and end patriarchy (which is the whole reason for gender roles existing in the first place), they choose to silence us. That\'s what the patriarchy does, which makes TRAs aligned with the patriarchy, no matter how many times they scream ""we\'re so inclusive"" into the ether. Making people ""feel included"" does jack shit for women\'s liberation.', 'My husband peaked WELL before me.\n\nHe had to listen to me be wrong. To reason with me. I may never recover the high ground.\n\nUgh, this BC case has me freaking the eff out. We really were trying to be inclusive. What a nightmare.', 'I\'ve been at Peak Trans for about a year now, and after an argument with a close friend today after ""coming out"" as a Radfem, I don\'t know what to do. Because the thing about all of this is, I don\'t disagree that people should be able to live their lives as they see fit; that\'s what we all want. But I can\'t figure out where the line is between trans people simply trying to figure themselves out and them invading women\'s spaces and taking places we have fought for for ourselves away from us. I know trans people. I go to school with a number of them (there seems to me to be a larger proportion of trans people in Theatre, but that\'s a different thread), and they\'re all decent people whom I like and get along with. But I also know and realize the harm in ideology that, even though it may not be perpetrated by every individual, is spread by a movement made up of and comprised of those same people. \n\nSo my Peak Trans moments continue to be trying to explain the circular logic and gender stereotypes that hold up (or rather, don\'t) the entire TRM, and being called transphobic or TERF for being critical and analytical of things that don\'t make sense.', 'I\'ve been slowly reaching peak trans over the past 6 months or so, but when I really think about it, it actually goes all the way back to 2013.\n\nMy 30 year old male cousin came out as transgender. At the time he was still living at home with our 80 year old grandmother and her older sister. I was (and still am) incredibly supportive of my cousin, but I was also not surprised when my Nana asked him to move and get his own place, which I thought was fair. I shared this all with an online friend who had also recently come out as transgender, and upon hearing that my grandmother asked my cousin to move, this person became completely unhinged. Started calling her all kinds of obscenities and foul names for not immediately accepting him. We\'re talking about two super devout catholic ladies who were born and raised in British Honduras (now Belize) in the 1920s/30s! The whole exchange really bothered me, and made me question if I was not being open-minded enough about the situation.\n\nSince then I have been someone who has been pretty blindly supportive of ""trans rights"", up until about 6 months ago when I started noticing a colleague of mine posting what I initially interpreted as anti-trans articles on social media. Very quickly, however, I realized that I was agreeing with a lot of what was being shared in these articles and essays, which I now understand (thanks to this sub) to be gender critical radical feminism.\n\nThe first thing that really bothered me was reading about MTF (I still don\'t get a lot of the acronyms and abbreviations so forgive me if this is incorrect terminology here) athlete\'s competing in women\'s sports.\n\nThen I read about that guy in Canada who is getting salons shut down for not waxing his damn balls.\n\nThen, twice in the last two weeks I have heard the term ""pregnant person"" or ""birthing person"", which is just too fucking much for me. It has gone too far when it is transphobic to refer to a pregnant women or a woman in labor as such. My friend who used the term ""birthing person"" at dinner asked what I feel is being threatened by that language. I had a hard time answering her, because right now it is just a feeling, but I\'m glad I found this place and I am eager to learn more.', 'I\'ve been lurking here for a year or so, finally decided to make a throwaway for radfem stuff. Reasons?\n\n-> I broke up with my friend after she posted on her Facebook a rant about how we need to talk about abortion with men. Why? Some men get pregnant, including her, and they need to be aware. Ugh. It came out of nowhere, she\'s very gender-conforming.\n\n->  Last week, I had my first run in with a TIM in a bathroom. It was a small public bathroom with two stalls. I had to spend good 15-minutes sitting there and listening to deep grunts and moans coming from the other stall before I felt brave enough to make a run for it. Immediately this huge guy in schoolgirl cosplay came out and with a shit-eating grin said ""Ooohhh... You\'re very pretty."" I legged it and thankfully he didn\'t follow.\n\n-> I just got notified that my daughter\'s school will include lessons in ""sexual and gender diversity, as well as alternative modes of self-expression, identity and relationship building"". Transgender is explicitly included, and there are some nods to fetish subcultures.\n\nI\'m tired. I need some sanity in my life.', 'I attend a clinic with an all female nursing staff. \n\nThey have started wearing large brightly colored card badges that state their pronouns eg she / her. \n\nThe badges are fixed to the bottom of their normal laminated ID badges on their lanyards so they now have a massive flappy bit of paper dangling over their stomachs. \n\nSo a female run clinic, with 80 percent female patients (the condition affects mainly women) is wearing inconvenient and potentially unhygienic badges to cater to the feelings of non-existent trans members of staff. \n\nI hate that we are policing ourselves like this.', 'I have a few peak trans stories.\n\n1. During the whole Johnathan/Jessica Yaniv situation, I was following a tumblr called terf-tips, which parodies the ideologies of so-called terfs. One of the moderators said that she felt Yaniv was simply using the trans platform to get away with preying on children and was not actually a transgender woman. This mod started calling Yaniv ""he,"" and so many people jumped on this mod that she was actually removed from the entire group. In this whole conversation, it seems that people are MUCH more concerned about making sure no one ""misgenders"" Yaniv than about thinking critically about the way that self-ID may have led to this situation and figuring out ways to ensure that trans rights don\'t infringe on the rights of women and girls to be safe.\n2. The cotton ceiling shit. The way that everyone insists there\'s nothing rapey about it and that if you think there is, you\'re a transphobe. The idea that lesbians are simply the ultimate achievement to unlock in the video game that is a male\'s transition. When I was best friends with a trans woman (for several years), I observed that she actually had an easier time getting dates presenting female than she did while presenting male (probably because she started brushing her damn teeth after coming out). There doesn\'t seem to be a shortage of natal women willing to date trans women. The only issue is that these women are not LESBIANS. Their love and sexual affection is meaningless because they do not validate that the trans woman is 100% female and 0% male. Lesbians are told we\'re not real lesbians and are ""dirty vagina fetishists."" We are told to fuck out of our own community, even though we\'re the ones who built that community, and they\'re the ones invading it. People like Riley J. Dennis are using this wishy-washy double-speak of, ""No one is FORCING you to have sex with trans women, but if you don\'t want to, then you\'re probably a bigot,"" and Everyday Feminism is giving him a platform. This is what mainstream FEMINISTS think is okay. \n3. The fact that the words ""man"" and ""woman"" are now completely meaningless. The fact that every time a lesbian writes about pussy (even if she\'s writing about her sex life with her girlfriend or wife), ten trans people jump on the post all ""DIDJA KNOW SOME WOMEN HAVE PENISES THO????"" The fact that lesbians are grilled on whether or not we\'d date trans women to determine if we\'re ""good"" lesbians or ""bad"" lesbians. The homophobic shit I see people writing and getting away with ie: ""Gay men will shove anything up their asses, and they\'re complaining about trans men\'s dildos?""\n4. The fact that I was repeatedly told for years that TERFs were a hate group and that I had to block every single one of them, but then I actually talked to one and found out all the stuff my friends told me was bullshit.\n\nMore later.', 'I was planning to ditch this account because I don\'t want it to get mixed up with my main, but hell I might ditch my main and stay here. Things can not be unseen. I\'m active in a lot of ""female centered subs"", and I use quotes because they really aren\'t, and it\'s become so infuriating I can barely keep my mouth shut.\n\nI was watching the Yaniv story pretty closely, hoping, that MAYBE, just maybe, this would put the brakes on things, but no, it\'s denial mode now. It isn\'t just trans and TRAs either, so many women subs bend the fuck over backwards for men and I can\'t stand it. Men seeking validation, emotional labor, wanting cookies for being baseline decent. That\'s infuriating, but what\'s more is how many women kowtow to it. Why?! And not to shit on other women, and if I think about it, I can come up with the reasons why- internalized misogyny, culture, and given statistics how many women have experienced trauma, it does make sense. But seriously though, what can be done? How can you wake people up?', 'My peak trans moment came when I was made aware of autogynephilia. I think most people, 90% (myself included) have no idea this is going on. When I thought of transgender I thought of the stereotypical homosexual transsexual, effeminate men wanting to become women. I was also aware of the masculine type woman who is more comfortable identifying as a man. Neither of these bother the majority of people. Live and let live. \n\nHowever with this Yaniv situation, it is pushing people to discover and understand the malicious and twisted world of AGP. These men get off by simply being in female spaces. I’m pregnant with my first child (a girl.) I’m terrified, thanks for asking. I was telling my husband about Yaniv and AGP, and he was flabbergasted. About 10 minutes later he looks up from his laptop, all the color drained out of his face and tells me, “I can’t stop thinking about it, now I have to worry about predators in the ladies room? Is anywhere safe?!” It never really was, even less so now. \n\nWhat can we do? How do we protect our women and girls? I was like most in thinking who cares if trans people want to use the ladies room? I had no idea it was more sinister than that. It’s the reason they try so hard to fight research on AGP, they know people will see them for what they are. I’m one news story away from hiding in a bunker.', ""Made a throwaway just to come here and rant.\n\nI've been lurking here for a few weeks as I've just really opened my eyes to the dangers of all this.\n\nI've had many little peaks (Wax My Balls, women's sports, It's MAAM, the dismantling of women-only spaces, cotton ceiling, etc.) This week I hit a few more and I want to scream. \n\n1) The Vancouver Rape Center Crisis. They decided against letting a TIM volunteer, as many of the women they help are absolutely terrified of men. Someone nailed a rat to their door, and they are still being vandalized and accused of being transphobic. How much of a dick do you have to be to not understand that traumatized women need to feel safe?\n\n2) Joined a fb group about practical witchcraft. At first I just see posts of people making posts about herbs, pagan-ish crafts, stuff like that. Then one of the mods posts about a certain book, saying it's super terfy and hateful, transphobic, etc etc etc. Says 'Don't read this!'\n\nIt was a book about women's magic. \n\nOne of the pages she screenshotted mentioned doing magic according to your cycles. In another screenshotted page, the author noted in the forward that she didn't want to exclude transgenders, but encouraged them to find their path (or something to that effect). I saw NOTHING hateful at all. But just mentioning women's cycles is apparently hateful now. \n\nThe comment thread blew up. Many of the comments were people agreeing ... the usual 'kill terfs' 'fuck terfs'. Anyone who disagreed even a bit was immediately banned. It was crazy. I suspect the author will suddenly find herself dealing with horrible reviews, which can be very damaging. \n\n3) The terminology. Menstruators. Uterus bearers. Not all women have vaginas. Some women have penises. Trans women are women. Every time I see that, I'm just like .... ugh. Fuck outta here with that misogynistic, delusional BS. It's so degrading. Dress how you want, change your name, whatever. I have no issue with that. But I have an issue with being relegated to my girly bits. I have an issue with brainwashing people and denying biology. \n\n4) Clicked on the #trans hashtag on Twitter. It just seems like all the posts are creepy in that in-your-face-I'm-fabulous-you-suck type of way. Lots of anime, men in lingerie taking pics of their bulges. Ugh. \n\n5) Seeing more and more how the TRAs center themselves in everything. Even the use of the term CIS. It apparently means 'not transgender' ... which puts emphasis on the transgender bit. Seeing so many posts about how many trans women are getting murdered, nothing about the real women that have been killed. \n\nI think one thing that makes me sad is that I've seen so many comments from the trans community to the effect of 'Terfs want us dead' 'They want to deny us our right to exist' and whatnot. AFAIK, that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm very much a 'You do you' person. I have a few trans friends, and I use their 'preferred pronouns, whatever. We just want to draw a line somewhere to preserve women's spaces, safety, and rights. I'm very bothered by how women's voices are being silenced on this.   \nI'm also very wary of how young children are being funneled into transitioning. Every week it seems someone is transing a little kid. I think it's child abuse. Many of them will end up sterile, and will some day realize they never had a chance to have a normal life and have kids. IMHO: this is deliberate. I suspect that it's population control/eugenics.   \n\n\nI suspect a backlash is coming as more and more people peak. But I don't know what will be left of women's rights. \n\nEnd rant"", 'I had a friend gofundme\xa0 $20,000+ \xa0to get a ""gender affirmation surgery"" (facial feminization) once the money was raised he left for Spain within the next week which made me realized he already had the funds so the surgery/flights/accommodation/recovery was already booked/paid for he was just trying to get his money back. I guess no big deal deal but he had completely omitted this fairly critical detail in his go fund me which was all very wordy with the becoming my true self/authentic/living your truth rhetoric. Watched him spend the next 3 weeks post surgery in a cabana bed in seaside Spain while everyone called him brave.', 'So, I\'ve lurked around here a lot but never felt compelled to share until today. I used to be 100% on board with trans issues and now, while I\'ll call anybody whatever they want, I don\'t believe it\'s possible to be ""a man trapped in a woman\'s body"" or vice versa. Just like wearing pants or other ""masculine"" coded clothing doesn\'t make me male or a man, a man who wants to wear skirts isn\'t female. I\'ll respect how you want to live your life outside of the constraints of gender stereotypes, but that doesn\'t really have anything to do with your sex. Anyways.\n\nToday I attended a women\'s adult sports league and as we were going around introducing ourselves, a woman interjected that we should state our pronouns. I thought that was ludicrous given that, even if there was a male in the circle, he ""identified"" as a woman, since that\'s kind of the requirement for participating in a women\'s sport. \n\nSecondly, I saw a comment on facebook that said ""Transgender people are born with one of many conditions affecting the reproductive system such as polycystic ovarian syndrome."" PCOS is an endocrine disorder...of females...it has literally nothing to do with gender dysphoria. It certainly can cause dissatisfaction with the body, but in and of itself, is not a precursor to or indicator of transgenderism. \n\nSo frustrated!', ""In New Zealand this last week there's been a huge scandal because an 80 year old lesbian wrote an article about trans rights and women's rights in the Green party newsletter. The party reacted terribly to it! I felt sick watching everyone in Facebook groups calling this woman horrible things. They even went do far as to call her evil. Evil! In her article she was NEVER mean to trans people, not once! Her language wasn't entirely PC but how is anybody supposed to keep up with that? The appropriate terms change all the time. Now the split in the Party has become a news story but the news are taking select quotes from the article and using them without proper context. There are now men demanding certain women leave the party! There has been so much rage but so little reasoning. It's a mob dynamic.\n\nI kept rereading her article and could not see the hate speech and now it's been removed! When looking for it I stumbled across this subreddit, how brilliant. Thank you whoever copied it here. I've been reading all the information I can find on this topic. I think I've reached peak trans. It's not reasonable to expect women's rights to be subordinated to men's egos let alone feminist. I'm relieved to see so many others say ENOUGH."", 'While I still try to be supportive of my trans friends and loved ones, there\'s one thing that disturbs me, and that is how they constantly assume that if a person isn\'t conforming to the gender roles of their sex, they\'re genderqueer, non-binary or transgender. I get that they want to see themselves represented, but I don\'t like how they focus so much on ""gender presentation"". They claim that celebrities like Freddy Mercury aren\'t cis because he defied gender roles. Sigh. \n\nI\'m part of a friend group of around 20 young adult LGBT people and I\'m one of two who isn\'t identifying as transgender. It\'s kinda weird. Especially since most of them are like ""yeah I don\'t feel like I connect to femininity/masculinity, so I must be agender."" Or ""as a kid I preferred pants to dresses and didn\'t like having long hair, you could see already then that I was non-binary."" \n\nAlso, I find it a bit strange how identifying as stuff like ""demigender"" or ""agender"" but still using your assaigned name and the pronouns corresponding to your sex, is seen as equal to being a trans man or trans woman who is undergoing or wanting to undergo medical treatment. These two situations seem pretty different, why are both groups called trans? The latter group faces so many more struggles. Like of course I\'m gonna accept that you identify as genderfluid, no problem, but your situation isn\'t comparable to binary trans people who are seeking medical care.', 'Hello, there! I found this sub just a few weeks ago and I\'m so relieved. I don\'t have just one peak trans story, I have several.\n\nA few years ago, a childhood friend of mine came out as ""non-binary"". She got a buzz cut and started dressing in androgynous clothes. She wants to be referred to as he/him or they/them. She also takes very revealing pictures of her very female body and puts them on social media. She then gets angry when people in the comments refer to her as a woman, despite the fact that she\'s posing seductively in lingerie with obvious breasts, hips and curves. The most ridiculous was when she posted a topless picture with two emojis over her nipples and captioned it ""who said boys can\'t have a great rack?"". Oh, fuck off. You want to deny your womanhood in one breath and then use your feminine body for attention and likes on social media in the next? It was ridiculous and she seemed to change her ""gender identity"" and pronouns every five minutes and heaven help you if you didn\'t keep up. She thought she was that fucking special and interesting that everyone should be constantly checking her social media for her pronouns and gender du jour. It was absolutely RIDICULOUS. She went on a diatribe about how the Spanish language is trans-exclusionary because there is no gender neutral pronoun and WHAT ABOUT MEEEEEEEEE. But what peaked me was when I found out that her boyfriend (a ""gender fluid"" drag queen/TIM-lite) refers to her as she/her and doesn\'t call her by her new, hip non-binary name. I always thought dead-naming a trans person was a crime comparable to genocide? Why was her boyfriend, the person who is supposed to support her the most, allowed to call her by her undeniably feminine name? It was absolutely ridiculous and she just turned out to be a massive attention seeker who used her trans/non-binary fantasies as an excuse to feel morally superior and a persecuted minority when in reality... she\'s just a gender non-conforming woman who likes wearing sexy lingerie from time to time? Her life was a massive mindfuck and it was so exhausting to be around her because of the massive stick up her ass and her constant complaining and claims of persecution. I barely ever interact with her anymore which is a shame, because before she got indoctrinated in this weird trans cult, she was really fun and interesting. But it\'s hard to be fun and interesting when all you can talk about is your fucking gender that you change more often than your underwear. As far as I know, she\'s a big deal in the LGBT student union at one of the biggest universities in my country and was instrumental in getting the university to offer ""non-binary"" as a gender on student ID cards.', 'I\'m watching peachyoghurt\'s latest video where she interviews 4 korean women so I got reminded of my own progress: I started hate reading auntiewanda\'s blog on tumblr after she got into an argument with a friend of mine (who was also dating a person whose url used to be ""scullies"", they claimed to be a woman but looked like your average basement dwelling NEET) and was outraged at first. I was very involved in the truscum discourse at the time (I still believe in the medical aspect of dysphoria being a criteria of being trans) and had only heard of the evil TERFs calling transmen \'shrimp dick\' and \'mutilated/misguided\' women, so naturally I was very wary of this side of the online discussion (I\'m still wary about the whole \'mutilation\' talk since I started reading blogs by detransitioned women and radical leaning trans men, which has been a godsend). This started about three years ago. One of the peaks, to get to my original point, was a user urging others not to reblog or spread the posts about the Korean feminists protesting spy cams and the Take of the Corset movement, since it was \'terf rhetoric\' and harmful to trans women. There were two prominent Korean and Japanese radfem blogs calling the user out and I honestly delighted in their responses, and I\'m glad that at least online there are strong Asian women rising to the challenge and making their opinions known.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: another thing was people tacking \'AND TRANS WOMEN ESPECIALLY\' onto posts that talked about womens\' issues, because they\'re somehow not included in a way?? if you talk about women surely you mean trans women too so why mention them specially?', '**The Magdalene Collective.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI missed this a couple of weeks back...but I just managed to retrace the story today and I am floored.\n\nBasically, I came out of conservative evangelicalism--and more than that the homeschooling community within conservative evangelicalism--and the community was all about enforcing strict sex-roles for men and women. I was one of the lucky ones--my parents were the more ""progressive"" ones in the community and prioritized education for my siblings and me, and we were able to question things even in high school. That didn\'t change the fact that...for example...I was the only girl in my (large) homeschool choir in my year who had plans to go to college. The rest were staying at home to learn homemaking and how to be good wives. (For those in the know--Vision Forum, The Pearls, Bill Gothard, Sovereign Grace, etc. were huge in these circles).\n\nI was on the periphery--I still had my own demons such as convincing myself that I wasn\'t actually a member of an inferior class of being--but ultimately I had excellent resources. I went on to higher ed and actually got a STEM degree. Meanwhile many girls in my community didn\'t get taught math past middle school level (""Why does she need to know about pi--is she ever going to have to carpet a circular room?""), and faced extreme educational neglect to their detriment--in the worst cases they were married early and started having kids immediately--making a way out very difficult.\n\nI\'ve watched over the years from my relatively comfortable position as more and more started speaking out about what was done to them. Their stories started on No Longer Quivering, moved to Homeschoolers Anonymous, and then everyone seemed to migrate to twitter. It was cathartic to see the angry voices of so many women, crying out to show other, younger women and girls that no, the ideology was not ok. It was wonderful for me...I can only imagine how it was for those with more extreme experiences. I\'ve watched in amazement as they\'ve toppled the empires of Gothard, VF, SGM, etc.\n\nConflict was rising, however. It had to. In running away from the anti-human rights stances of fundamentalism, the groups (rightly) promoted feminism, anti-racism, and support for the LGBT community. And with that one last letter, the TRAs/genderists had their in. There\'s a difficulty however. When you have a movement built by women--the ones most starkly affected by this ideology--they are bound together by their undeniable common experiences of oppression. And some of these women identifying as men or as nonbinary does nothing to remove the cohesive experiences that they all still share. There\'s also no way for men who came out of the movement to understand these cohesive experiences at the same visceral level--indeed the most interesting thing was how blind they were to them. The creationism they were bitter about...the religion they were bitter about...but the fact that their sisters were clearly property at the bottom of a clearly defined caste system? Often it didn\'t faze them till they\'d already self-righteously left the movement for other reasons.\n\nEnter Christopher Stroop. A year or so ago he started the exvangelical hashtag on twitter and he enjoyed a meteoric rise, getting a regular column in Playboy (yes, a ""woke"" column in Playboy...) as well as pieces and interviews in many mainstream outlets. He quickly became \\*the\\* voice for those who defected from evangelicalism, boasting a PhD in Russian Studies which he absolutely touted to boost his credibility (nevermind that many of the women in the movement were basically kept from even dreaming about such a higher education). But guess what? He was saying nothing new (nothing new compared to the last eight years or so of women speaking out)--in fact he said things with less nuance and the kind of clumsiness that comes from too much angst. It\'s a pattern I\'ve noticed--the men are let off easy in comparison yet they somehow still manage to be angrier than the women at what was done to them. That\'s male socialization right there.\n\n(Saving for posterity here...one of the women pointed out that he only took up this movement when he failed to find a tenure track university job...only adding insult to injury.)\n\nAnyway....the women struck back. They teamed up regardless of their identities (""cis,"" ""nonbinary,"" or ""transmasculine""), and formed a joint twitter account called the Magdalene Collective to signal boost each other. They published a statement about how in the exvangelical movement ""AMAB"" people were speaking over ""AFAB"" people and beginning to dominate despite the fact that ""AFAB"" people really started the movement. They pointed out that ""AMAB"" people had a way of being blind to the harsh experiences and unique oppressions that the ""AFAB"" people experienced and still experience (with regard to their reproductive systems in particular)...\n\nThe rest is...well you know the drill. The twitter account is now shuttered, the statement is now wiped from the internet, and the women are performing their penance. Meanwhile Stroop has responded by coming out as a ""girl"" (yes, ""girl"") himself, and has blamed them for ""outing"" him. He has posted about how they are oppressing ""AMAB"" people, and the twitter court of opinion has vindicated him. I am so peaked right now. I\'ve been reading this crap for three hours straight and what can I say...it all just sucks. We were so close to seeing a coalition of female people in the movement--sex-based oppression literally smacked them in the face their entire lives after all--and then it was quelled. Male-rule continues.\n\nMaybe next time...\n\n\\[I just had to document these events here for posterity. This uprising was so short-lived and so effectively immediately quelled that I worry its internet record will be completely gone in a short time.\\]', 'This isn\'t a very dramatic story, especially compared to many of the others posted here.  I\'ve never been personally victimized by a trans-identified male and probably never will be.  I live in a pretty conservative area, and I can only recall 1 instance in my entire life of being in the same room as somebody who I knew to be transgender.  That person was a trans-identified male who was extremely ""passable.""  Like, this person looked actually enough like a woman that I wasn\'t entirely sure if this person was transgender or not.   You could just barely tell that there was just something a little off about ""her.""  The only reason I knew for sure that this person was trans was that I overheard this person talking about how her boyfriend had broken up with ""her.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently, the TiM had finally worked up the courage to tell ""her"" boyfriend that ""she"" was transgender, and he\'d had a very negative reaction.  He didn\'t yell or scream or anything like that, just had a ""deer-in-headlights"" look and went silent.  I felt very bad for this person, hearing this.  I wasn\'t even really supposed to hear it.  But it made sense to me.  I mean, what other possible outcome could such a relationship possibly have?  Where else could it possibly go?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, this person had the best-case scenario that a TiM could ever ask for, in the sense that he looked enough like a girl that he\'d actually managed to fool somebody into thinking that he genuinely was a woman, at least for a while.  Very few TiM\'s are able to achieve that standard.  But what was the point of it all?  This person must have done absolutely horrific things to himself to get to that point, and in the end all it got him was a broken heart.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis kind of behavior just shouldn\'t be encouraged.  It just sets people up for a lifetime of misery and disappointment.  I have no idea where this person is now or what they are currently doing, but I just can\'t see any scenario for how this person could possibly have a happy ending.', 'I just found one of the funniest comments ever, or a TIM that says the stupidest shit ever that it’s making me peak again. It blows my mind how much these men take words that are descriptions for us, and twist them to make them fit them. This TIM is truly an ugly one (and I mean his personality, he’s a fucking cretin) saying that he’s biologically female because of his ladybrain. So many of his comments say that he’s biologically female and that his dick isn’t a male sexual organ, it’s just a dick, and of course he’s “lesbian”. I cannot make this shit up and I wish I was. What kind of psychotic shit is this? Honestly. I hate these men, so fucking much. Taking the word woman wasn’t enough, now they’re taking female and since they claim they have a ladybrain they are saying they are biologically female and saying a penis isn’t male. How detached from reality do you have to be to even say that? I don’t care what anyone says, being trans is a mental illness. Period. If you think a penis is a part of the female reproductive system, you’ve failed biology and you are also detached from reality. Also, double fuck you to the men that are comparing being trans to having PCOS, compare their issues with hormones to having endo, and the ones that say they are no different than a woman that does not have their period.

You can no longer be a man who likes skirts, or a woman with short hair, it\'s like you HAVE to be a TIM or a TIF.\n\nAnd it\'s just sad.

These same sites push the idea that GNC people are really trans. So it\'s like, normal GNC people, tihnk they\'re trans because these sites push the idea, and they also go from a normal, usually middle class and white, person to some sort of oppressed Messiah who can do no wrong.\n\nI feel like I\'m taking crazy pills and I\'m so glad some people in that discord agreed with me.', ""Riding on a crowded subway car and there is a person sprawled across 2 seats who at first glance reads as female but of course not.

He dates a guy for a few months who seemed really loving before breaking up with him and saying ""I\'m actually trans."" The pieces didnt match up though at the time I was very accepting of trans people in general but kind of thought of it as intersex people and people born with different genes that affect their brain, similar to autism maybe - not exactly an illness but not non-medical. But this friend had started hanging out around a lot of really bizarre quirky types claiming to be non binary and trans with no effort or real fear of rejection, people who wear tails to an ivy league school, I knew a lot of these people from classes or around and all of them are really phony and the type if delusional person wholl tell you they\'re a witch born from another planet who spent their life growing up in Indonesia when it\'s like no Emily you grew up in Connecticut to a very WASPy family. \n\nPhony\n\nJust really phony people. This was back in 2012-2014 too and with this crowd at our school I have to say it was really obviously a trend for a few attention seekers. Batwing arm shirts and ripped skinny Jean\'s were also trends and this was clearly no different. \n\nBut I otherwise was nice to these people, accepted them for the most part because theres no reason to shit on someone for an illness/not quite an illness. They were friendly to me most of the time, but most people clearly didnt take their transness seriously. \n\nThen my friend claimed to be trans. Even if trans is real or not (bad word but cant think of a better one) I knew my friend wasnt. He also has a history of doing crazy shit for attention and I know he has a lot of shame in being gay. \n\nIdk when he came out at trans and his perception of women clearly being a big and brassy 1950s housewife it just was so obviously phony, and frankly hurtful as his (female) closest friend that his view of women is so degrading.

Never wanted to seem transphobic and get verbally abused by everyone under the sun, but just avoided them and think they\'re ridiculous. \n\nThen a lot more stuff came to the table being touted as feminist and woke but...it all was very blatantly anti feminist. \n\nShortly after I ran into ContraPoints videos. I\'m really into philosophy and critical videos so I clicked, and i watched a few videos. The one on beauty was weird but agreed to a lot of it so I clicked another, it was on TERFs...and I found myself only agreeing to the character that was the TERF.

I was repeatedly told to kms and choke for not liking dick. \n\nSince then I’ve entered more gender critical spaces and now see TIMs for what they are.

Because their genitals show up on the TSA\'s scanners as ""anomalies,"" you see, which makes sense considering actual women obviously don\'t have dicks or balls. This leads to an awkward situation wherein the ""woman"" is flagged as potentially having a bomb or some other kind of dangerous object stuffed in her pants, and therefore must be patted down. But the stunning and brave hero in this article, ""Olivia,"" felt traumatized and violated over that -- not the part about being patted down so much as the fact that she didn\'t feel validated when the actual women in the TSA refused to touch her dick and only male officers offered to do it. How incredibly fucking stupid.\n\nThe worst part of all is that smart people I like and respect -- I first saw the article linked on Elizabeth Warren\'s Facebook, and it was also shared by the fucking ACLU -- fall for this shit and act as though the validation of these men\'s feelings is somehow the real problem. Rather than, you know, FORCING WOMEN TO TOUCH MEN\'S DICKS AGAINST THEIR WILL, which is what ""Olivia"" was demanding. Elsewhere we rightly call that ""sexual assault"" or ""rape."" But here, it\'s somehow a violation of the perverted man\'s civil rights that he isn\'t allowed to force a woman to grope him??? What kind of dystopian world is this? I cannot take this shit anymore. ""Olivia"" was not even disrespected -- she was ""validated"" as a woman when the agents scanned her as one, but that\'s not good enough; oh no, we have to pretend that you are not just an ""identified"" female, but a BIOLOGICAL female as well, and therefore must be treated exactly the same as an actual woman in all circumstances, even when it directly pertains to your biology.\n\nIt\'s not hard to take this one step farther and reverse the situation -- what if a ""trans woman"" was a TSA agent and was brought in to pat down a real woman? Now we have a man with a dick literally grabbing women by the pussy. Pretty sure liberals rightfully were outraged over the president doing exactly that -- but something tells me in this context it would be considered ""stunning and brave."" It\'s as though trans people are literally beyond all criticism, totally untouchable, and if you so much as joke about them or look at them the wrong way you\'re going to be crucified. It is absolute madness and it pains me to say it, but it gives the right massive amounts of ammo to easily deflect any criticism of their own terrible and crazy ideas.

And since no one is willing to hash out the issues, either in real life or on reddit, it\'s hard not to conclude that I\'m only getting silence because they know that there\'s no substance to their claims.\n\nTwo pivotal points in my life were when I became an atheist and when I became a vegan. I could talk for days about either of these, and I\'m always willing to hear the other side and consider if I\'m wrong. On the weekends, I do exactly that, talking to people on the street about veganism and seeing if I can change their minds. What I don\'t do is ""Block and stay safe.""

I never understood how was it different from classic stereotypes of femininity and masculinity. But, as a gay man, I felt like I had to support trans issues for compassion and solidarity. Not anymore.\n\nI graduated from medical school last year. During my last months there, a controversy around the subject of 'transgenderism' arose during one of the Psychiatry classes. One student, who identifies as non-binary (he is a guy with a beard who sometimes wears eyeliner), protested because the material they were given to study disorders of sexual conduct was 'transphobic'.\nThe texts said something about trans patients being 'very demanding' and sometimes engaging in self-harm in order to get attention. This is true for many mental disorders, but this guy immediately jumped to getting offended. He never personally approached the Psychiatry professor to talk about it, but tried to get the man fired. Sadly, a lot of other students supported him.\nThis same 'non-binary' guy had received a lot of attention a few months before because he publicly denounced an agression he suffered, which he deemed 'transphobic'. He was having a night out and went to this club which had different entrance fees for men and women. He said to the bouncers that he would not pay, since he was neither a man nor a woman and that the prices were 'discriminating' him. He made a scene there and was forcibly removed from the door. He then wrote an article that was published by the most important online news site in our country (southern Europe). The article stank of arrogance and classism. He went on about how he was a medical student while his opponent was 'just a bouncer', and complaining about how everyone was so 'ignorant' on gender issues and he had to be 'educating' everyone all the time.\nI have never talked to this guy personally, but I have been in student's assemblies with him and he is a narcissistic, attention-seeking asshole with a pathological need for being considered 'special'. He is always demanding professors and fellow students to use 'gender-neutral language', which is impossible to do in our native language unless you modify every single word in a way that is non-sensical for most people.\n\nAll of this, in addition to my previous skepticism on the matter made me think. Why does this guy feel entitled to police the language of his peers and the contents of our classes, while I feel embarassed to bring up my doubts on trans issues? Why should we (homosexuals)  accept them in our spaces and political movements, if they are trying to erase the basis of our sexual preference and identity (which is sex, not gender)? How is my struggle the same as this idiot's? The answer is simple: IT IS NOT.\n\nThen I heard about kids being transitioned, and I went from mildly upset to terrified and disgusted. Little children all around the world are being experimented on and turned into freaks because they are not masculine or feminine enough for their bodies. Little gay and lesbian kids are lead to think they should have been born as members of the opposite sex.\nAs a doctor, I started to look up for the scientific evidence backing this up. Surprise! There is NONE. The only argument they use to defend 'transition' is that, if they don't do it, they will eventually kill themselves (based on some very unclear stats). So we are basically telling children who have a different gender expression that their options are 'transition or die'. This is psychological violence, commited by certain doctors and trans activists.\n\nAs always, REAL WOMEN are the most affected by all this madness. Female-only spaces are facing extinction, and with them the sense of security and control over their lives they had conquered. Women sports are being invaded by mediocre males who could not make it in the men's category. The language needed to discuss female issues is now deemed 'exclusionary'. Lesbians are being attacked for not wanting dick.\nAs a gay man and feminist ally, I stand in solidarity with real women, and I will not take part in this ridiculousness anymore."", 'Hello, I am a newbie to GC but not Reddit. \n    \nI used to be the most trans accepting person ever. I am (nearly) 29 and I\'ve been trans accepting since a teen cos I myself had gender issues at that age. Turns out I\'m just a bisexual who likes both female and male clothing, hobbies, etc. Because I had been on the trans movement side for so long, I never questioned when recent trans issues started to arise e.g. bathrooms etc. I openly labelled myself as anti-terf and blocked anyone who I thought was a terf. But my peak trans moment came when I saw people advocating that lesbians aren\'t real lesbians unless they also accept TiM ""girl dick"". I\'m like, hold on, that sounds reaaaaally rapey and conversation therapy sounding. Then I found my own bisexual identity being called transphobic cos I am ""only attracted to two genders"" I thought, hold up, I thought transmen and transwomen wanted to be identified as just men and women so how is my sexuality excluding them? Then I\'m being called transphobic cos I only want to have sex with vaginas on female bodied people and dicks on male bodied people. I\'ve spent most my life sticking up for trans people but just because I dare to have a sexual preference, means I am transphobic.     \nThat\'s when it hit me that many TiM and TiF (especially TiM I find) literally are doing this to force people to have sex with them. TRA think they are being woke by supporting trans people, but so so so many trans ppl will turn around and call you transphobic for refusing their advances. Doesn\'t matter how much of an ally you are, you are transphobic if you don\'t agree to sex. I then realised that many of the things that especially TiM are fighting for is access to spaces that aren\'t socially acceptable if they were to say it as their birth sex, e.g. bathrooms, changing rooms, women\'s only spaces, etc. The amount of TiM I see wanting things like anti discrimination at work laws for example, is far LESS than ones that are advocating for ""gender neutral"" bathrooms. It is all about getting into women\'s spaces.    \nAs women we are already being attacked from every angle e.g. recent abortion ban bills, but now we can\'t even say ""women\'s rights"" without someone chiming in saying ""not all women have uteruses, be more inclusive"". Why can\'t be have a single discussion or cause to ourselves without someone being a input hoe that we got to think about men too?    \nSo yes, I am a reborn GC.

I don\'t believe that the pain of ""gender dysphoria"" is greater or more important or more soul-crushing than anybody else\'s pain who must deal with their (real and diagnosable!) disability or deformity. \n\nNo, I do not often feel comfortable in my body. It has betrayed me from a young age. It\'s caused straight years and years of agony and depression. It\'s quite difficult and disheartening to shop for clothing and shoes. It\'s insanely hard to exercise. It can be difficult at times to feel pretty or beautiful - or to simply NOT feel hideous. But guess what, I fucking MAKE DO WITH WHAT I\'VE GOT. \n\nFunny how a barrage of major surgeries and meds from childhood on with lasting effects on my body, and being forced to navigate the hostile, distrusting, and patronizing medical industry will make me look at a transgender person whining about their urgent need for medical intervention because of their FEELINGS, and I just stare back blankly thinking ""......and?""', 'Discovering that TiMs are allowed to compete against women in MMA fighting/the Fallon Fox story.

I spent many months thinking I was a fraud and a closeted conservative because my brain simply refuse to accept so-called ""inclusive"" arguments on popular ""feminist"" websites that made zero sense to me. It all goes back to when I became a high school teacher. Over the years I\'ve had a handful of students who defined themselves as ""trans"" or ""non-binary"", either through name changes or subtle clues like pins on their bags. I\'ve always tried to be as supportive and respectful as I can, because goodness knows adolescence is hard and the best adults can do is be a benevolent presence in their lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it recently came to my mind that all of these students were girls. Every. Single. One. It was like being struck by thunder. This could NOT be a coincidence. Thinking back I fear that these young women, at an age where most people are vulnerable and confused, were being somehow persuaded that if they didn\'t fit some sort of sexualised, hyperfeminine norm, that if they didn\'t want to show off their cleavage or wear their hair long or felt a same-sex attraction, it meant they weren\'t really women and should redefine themselves accordingly - when clearly the boys, whether jocky or geeky, gay or straight, weren\'t being coerced into this same kind of logic. It\'s both heartbreaking to me as a human and infuriating to the feminist I\'ve always been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then I read an article in The Guardian saying that activist groups wanted to erase the word ""women"" in UN resolutions about abortion and contraception and replace it with ""people"", and that was the last straw. I\'m done accepting that we should be shamed into silence on these issues and made to think that ""woman"" is a dirty word.', 'I work in a building with about 9 other people. We are a small team. The building is about to undergo a complete restructure and the whole team was invited to discuss the proposed changes. We all had a look at the building plans and one woman stated, ""I really don\'t want gender neutral toilets"". \n\nEveryone looked at her and then another woman said, ""I also don\'t feel comfortable with gender neutral toilets"". I don\'t normally speak up about anything to do with my feminism, especially in the current climate and at work, but as 2 women had spoken honestly, I said ""yes I definitely would prefer to keep the male and female toilets separate"".\n\nAll the men looked blankly at each other and mumbled they didn\'t care either way (why would they! what threat/discomfort do they face in a mixed sex loo!) and then the manager simply said, ""well we need to be inclusive"". I asked her to expand further and she said, ""well if a trans person was to start working here..."". No trans people currently work in our office.\n\nThat\'s when I hit peak trans. When in a staff meeting about building work proposals, a hypothetical trans person held more weight than 3 women who worked everyday in said building.\n\nWhen I realised I would have to pee in the same toilets as a man who ogled my breasts to make a hypothetical, non existent trans person feel safe and respected.\n\nMy safety and respect was ignored because we as a team need to be seen as ""inclusive"". \n\nWe later suggested an additional third block of gender neutral toilets but this was dismissed as costing too much money. Lol.', 'I finally had my peak trans in the last week. I\'ve been studying the trans agenda for a while, found it wrong in many ways, but didn\'t really get totally outraged by it until this last week. I\'ve seen a TIM use a women\'s bathroom at a grocery store. He had a bad sundress on along with poorly applied makeup. It was clear he was a man. I called it ""womanface"" before reading it here, even. I was pretty shocked by that.\n\nBut it didn\'t really hit me until this past week when I played in a disc golf tournament where a TIM competed as a woman and won by a long shot.\n\nMind you, this is someone who has competed in tournaments as a man in the past. This person still has the legs of a man, legs which generate a lot of the power needed to succeed in disc golf on drives, hands of a man, height of a man, arms of a man. I don\'t know is this person did bottom surgery, I\'m sure this person is on hormone blockers and female hormones, etc.\n\nBut this person developed as a man!!!\n\nI know it\'s stupid to a degree. We are only throwing frisbees around, it\'s not as ""serious"" as sport as basketball or football or whatever, and no money was on the line because this person competed as an amateur.\n\nBut the fact is that for many of us, this sport is OUR SPORT! It\'s what we do in our free time, take time to get good at it, often to the sacrifice of other things, and we like to compete and play to win.\n\nBut how can we compete with a man who identifies as a woman? The differences between scores for men vs women are stark. Even when we women play from shorter tee pads (shortening the distance to the pin) than the men, the men almost always shoot lower scores than the women. It\'s not a fair fight at all.\n\nI\'ve dedicated so much time to cultivate a female friendly culture to my sport (as silly as it is) but now I have to accommodate a man who feels like a woman? We\'ve fought hard for our own designation and want to play to win.\n\nUnfortunately, if the ruling agency for disc golf is okay with men competing as women, real women are not going to be able to play to win in a tournament. We\'re going to be relegated to second, third, fourth and so on status.\n\nThat\'s my peak trans.

Though I been through the same bullshit they did and do all the time. 🤷"", '  \n\nHappy that I have found this sub and the concept of GC feminism recently. I have been reading a lot of your peak trans stories and was amazed how similar many of them are to my own:\n\nI am a straight woman in my 30ies. I have had my fair share of gender confusion as a small kid and as a teenager and often thought ""I\'d rather be a boy"". I was a ""tomboy"" and got misgendered quite a few times in my life, from elderly women fawning over me as a baby saying ""Aw, he is so cute!"" until well into adulthood. Not because I am super ""masculine""-looking (maybe a somewhat androgyne, tall and straight body type and short hair), but probably more due to my behavior, body language and personality. And today I recognize that because of this, I did not feel like a ""real"" girl/woman for a long time. Like many of you, I was also rejecting all that shit that I saw coming along with ""womanhood"". Even as a small girl, I was noticing the double standards that were applied to my behavior vs. the boys and I hated it. When puberty hit, I felt betrayed by my body growing impractical breasts that drew the attention from creepy older men and I started to hide under baggy clothes. Since I could not imagine myself with my outspoken, confrontational manners in a heterosexual relationship, I was sure I must be a lesbian. Lesbians, or so my teen brain figured, are allowed defy all notions of femininity and are free of obnoxious men expecting them to behave and dress in certain ways. And so, my first romantic experiences were with girls. When things got more sexual however, I soon realized that women\'s bodies are not my cup of tea. Since then I have been dating men, and luckily always had respectful relationships and encounters with empathic partners. It looks like my personality protects me from the entitled, narcissistic type of men, they are simply not attracted to me (and the other way around). I am now in a long-term relationship with a very gentle, passionate man, who is defying expectations regarding his gender in similar ways (people often read him as gay because of that).\n\nBecause of my experiences, I have always been a strong supporter of LGB rights. As for the T-part: In my country, transsexuality was regarded as a mental disorder and SRS is paid for by the general health insurance. So, my thinking was: There are people with my feelings of ""not belonging"" to my gender, just 100x stronger so that the only cure is SRS. I empathized that they suffering MUST be very severe if they are willing to mutilate their healthy bodies. It also seemed to be I very niche phenomenon, and like many of you I had a ""live and let live"" stance towards it.\n\nI got interested in feminist ideas relatively late in life (approximately 6 years ago), ""queerfeminism"" or liberal feminism was already the dominant trend. Since I am in the STEM field, I am not very literate in social sciences. Hence, I soaked up a lot of what libfems wrote and on a superficial level, it aligned a lot with what I thought what was right. I am part of an online forum that is mainly about natural birth control, but since it is naturally a community of biological women, also covers other topics around women\'s health and lives. In the discussion thread about feminism, I started to ask questions about inconstancies in gender theory that I could not wrap my head around. I was sure the libfems there with a social sciences degree could enlighten me how we can fight gender clichés on one side, and reinforce them when it comes to trans people. I asked if anyone knew what it feels like ""to be a woman"" since I didn\'t. And how is body dysmorphia always regarded as the hallmark of trans feelings, but then there are suddenly trans people that do not undergo SRS, yet claim to be the other gender? I was given no real answers but could read between the lines that I am just not open-minded and educated enough. Still, I was somewhat supportive of trans rights since this was what the left and the LGBTQ-community seemed to support and what my political adversaries opposed. I just seemed to be unable to fully grasp it.\n\nMy peak-trans moment came very suddenly two weeks ago when I was browsing the relationship advice sub and reading the original version of this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/itsafetish/comments/cjzcva/tim\\_makes\\_women\\_uncomfortable\\_after\\_they\\_were/](https://www.reddit.com/r/itsafetish/comments/cjzcva/tim_makes_women_uncomfortable_after_they_were/). And I was like: ""Wait, that kind of shit really happens?"". I had never heard of AGP before and started to educate myself. I also started to read the MTF and asktransgender subs in order to learn what motivations trans people themselves give for ""knowing they are the other gender"". I was appalled. By the pictures of anime girls posted as ""transition goals"" (I have always hated anime anyways). By the talk of ""feeling delicate and submissive"". By the story of JY\'s quest at the human rights tribunal (I have lived in this city for many years and know the atmosphere about ""inclusiveness"" and ""not hurting anybody’s feelings"" is way stronger there than in my home culture). Then I started reading the gender critical subs and it all makes so. much. sense now. Thank you. In retrorespect, I have always aligned more with radical feminism. I have always advocated against prostitution and am highly critical of porn and its impact on men and women. It was just that I could not find that kind of feminism in real life or online (exept maybe from one old feminist who is often invited in talkshows on national TV). I guess I am a TERF now and will stick around.\n\nNow that I have the language to word my long-harbored doubts around transgerderism, I guess I am now going to challenge the queerfeminists on the online forum I mentioned...', 'TIM’s claiming that they are now cis women because they have finished their transition.', 'I had many encounters, so many that I stepped out of the discussion and hide my homosexuality because I fear for my life.

They lost their shit over the last part (: I was also told that the Antifa will ""Take Care of me"" :)\nThey told me that I hate ""hate transpeople"" I said this isn\'t true.

I said this isn\'t true and that I had the feeling, they mirroring. They lost their shit again. \nI was friendly the whole  time and said that I only tell my expierences  and don\'t hate an entire group. They didn\'t believed me.

Also, I came of age in the 90s, when LGB was mostly still LGB, fought hard for gay rights (ironically, against my fundamentalist christian family--my mom later came out and is now married to another woman), and after I left college and started working, I lost touch with feminist activism a bit.

Again I\'ve had literally nowhere else I\'ve felt safe saying these things, so this is all a bunch of stuff I\'m getting off my chest:\n\n1.) Trans people are people of course, and I will always respect them like I would anyone else unless they did something that would make me revoke this respect. \n\n2.) Anyone who knows me knows that I would say that trans women are women, trans men are men, and nonbinary people are valid. But deep, deep, deep down, in reality, I don\'t know what to think. When I look at the average trans woman, trans man, etc, I know deep down I don\'t always truly see them as their preferred gender. Sometimes I do, and I think that\'s when they truly put effort into presenting as that gender. IDK. I can\'t really explain it. \n\n3.) SO much of online trans culture is so bullshit. ""Trans women are biological women!"" (and I never see this kind of affirmation for AFABs/trans men???) ""You don\'t need dysphoria to be trans!"" ""You don\'t need to alter your appearance or mannerisms to be another gender and that\'s valid!"" ""I\'m not going to answer your questions because that\'s emotional labor, fuck you!"" Questions and dissent are ALWAYS met with bans, mutes, often times even cyberstalking and bullying, sometimes doxing. What the fuck. \n\n4.) The amount of hate and violence I see against TERFs. Even way before I started questioning this cult-like way of thinking about trans-ness myself, I was always uncomfortable with this. People asserting that TERFs are literally nazis. People directing all their hatred at TERFs rather than, you know, transphobes in general. This always struck me as thinly veiled misogyny. You never see them say ""fuck transphobes,"" just ""fuck TERFs."" Hmm, wonder why.\n\n5.) The categorizing of all cis lesbians as TERFs/evil/mean/whatever. I am bi, not a lesbian, but my god I feel so bad for lesbians. Homophobes hate them but want to endlessly sexualize them. ""Transbians"" too. Other """"""queer"""""" people hate them because they personally don\'t want to sleep with trans people. Its horrifying. I am so sorry. \n\n6.) Its insane to me that accolades intended for women in male dominated fields are being given to trans women nowadays. Its undeniable that trans women were raised and socialized as men. So many of the struggles that women would have, haven\'t been experienced by them. This is literally just factual, but mentioning this will have you ostracized. \n\n7.) I believe cis women should be entitled to cis woman only spaces. Similarly I would support cis men only spaces, especially in fields where women outnumber them. That should be ok. It should be ok to want a community to retreat to for people like you. But its impossible to find cis woman only places. They\'re all ""woman-identified"" spaces, or sometimes even woman spaces in name only but let in literally anyone, even cis men. A women in computer science space I was in was like this, where half the members were men, most of which being cis men too. \n\n8.) I just want to embrace and love my womanhood and femininity without being labelled a TERF. I truly hate that this does not appear to be allowed anywhere. \n\n9.) Detrans people are valid and need support. I\'m baffled that they are ostracized and hated by the trans community. It\'s a very human thing to have misunderstandings, to make mistakes, to try to discover yourself and who you are every day. For example its all ""yaaass kween"" if an AMAB begins transitioning to a woman, but if he goes ""i personally was mistaken and I personally am actually a man,"" why shouldn\'t he and others like him be supported?\n\nI think that\'s all I\'ve got to get off my chest for now. I truly look forward to spending time here and discussing things with you all, even if we disagree!!', 'Tim I know from school came out a few years ago. He recently got a real tech job and all he posts about now is his “transition goals being so close I can taste it.” He’s planning on going to Thailand for FFS, BA, and most recently, he’s considering having his bottom ribs removed to have a “cute tiny waist”. I don’t know if he will actually do the rib removal but will definitely do the first two. He posts pictures of anime characters and young East Asian girls, saying he’s going to look just like her, then he can move on with life. How testosterone poisoned him. This guy is 30, has autism, is in tech, and of course, is a “lesbian”. He’s 30 and very “hulking”, and fetishizes the shit out of young Asian girls, it feels so skeevy and gross. Once he becomes his dream waifu (not gonna happen) and finds a waifu of his own (who knows), life will be perfect. It’s an obsession. 8/10 posts of his are about trans shit.', 'A minor TIM sent me graphic rape threats and justified it by saying that I’m a terf nazi. I asked them if they knew what a terf was, and they started spouting off about how radfems are terrible people and want trans people to die. Anyways most TRAs I’ve met have a problem with projection. And have no clue what they’re supporting.', 'I\'m fairly new to Reddit, avoided it up until I got ousted from my lesbian group on fb for pointing out that biology is real and trans women\'s penises are still male sex organs that I don\'t feel lesbians should be pressured to have sex with. I was called TERF, had to look up what the bloody hell that word meant, and within a month later here I am.\n\nOver these weeks that I\'ve been self-educating about gender politics, I found I\'ve kept hitting a wall. It seems impossible to agree with some points of Gender Critical thought but not others. Yet I\'ve been enmeshed with the gender ideology that has been so mainstream all around me from such a young age, growing very close to trans friends and yes, removing myself from the womanhood that was so threatening to me over a decade ago. I\'ve identified as non-binary for so long and never had any pause to question it until this past month.\n\nI\'m afraid of invalidating my friends... that\'s even harder to consider than the thought that I\'ve really been experiencing womanhood this entire time that I\'ve been non-binary. That part\'s actually surprisingly easy. I just made the connection that having been born female inherently makes every experience I\'ve had one of girlhood or womanhood. Even the identifying away from it was a woman\'s experience because it was mine.\n\nGiving up the sense of having a community and platform through which to share my views was a momentary snag, until I realized I\'d already lost it before even discovering that I wasn\'t trans. I lost that community and the ""right to talk about trans issues as a trans person"" when I betrayed gender ideology by speaking scientific facts.\n\nThe final thread really holding me to the middle of the fence, peeking over both sides, was my loyalty to my trans friends.\n\nThen tonight, I found this video on youtube; a lecture about the invention of body dysphoria and an explanation of autogynephilia:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FQtyGU766I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FQtyGU766I) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYep, that did it. I still feel compassion for my friends, I\'m not too sure how I\'ll deal with things interpersonally because of this shift, but it makes sense now. That itching confusion in the back of my brain keeping me from fully connecting the dots is finally gone. I have completed Peak Trans, both on the trans subject as a whole and within my own personal sense of self.\n\nI can\'t say that I identify as a woman... that\'s not something that I\'m feeling.\n\nWhat I can say is that I\'m an adult, I\'m human and I\'m female.\n\nSo hi, I\'m a woman. Nice to meet you.', 'I even feel unsafe sharing my peaking moment, because I fear I might be outed. \n\nEssentially, a man becoming the head of the feminist movement in my country, becoming famous, going on TV and speaking on behalf of women while we are pushing and fighting for rights that you, a male, will never experience. Such as abortion. Everyone is deluded. Everyone is falling for it. He is also basically a caricature, dressing in pornish clothes for everyday wear, putting excessive makeup on that makes him look like a clown, trying to gesticulate like the stereotype of a ""dumb feminine girl"" (think drag queens) would. It\'s sickening.', 'A guy in r/detrans today, saying he now accepted being male, and asking if it was OK for him to still use women\'s spaces. I said no, please don\'t, and he full on answered twice that he didnt care about injustice (?) he only cared about himself, so he will still use them regardless. Fuck women and women\'s safety I guess. \n\nMen are so entitled it just boggles my mind. Who cares if you ""detransition"" if you\'re still going to infringe in our privacy. Ffs', ""I'm a straight woman living in NYC. Friend of mine is bi-curious so we're going to the Dyke March today. Apparently, anyone can identify as a dyke, regardless of sexual orientation (?) or gender 'assigned' at birth. I want to scream. Thirty years ago, when I was struggling with sexual abuse issues, I went to all women/lesbian support group meetings for survivors. I owe my mental health to gay women. I owe my acceptance of my body and my sexuality to gay women. I owe being able to get out of less-than-optimal relationships to lesbians because I was in a milieu where men were beside the point. Being in female-only spaces was salvation to me. I was looking forward to being at an event for women, by women.  But that's not what's gonna happen because the dyke march is open to anyone - read 'men who fetishize lesbians', 'AGPs' and other assorted psychos. I feel like crying. I hate this transgender male invasion. I don't want to go to this thing; told my friend to look at the website and decide whether or not she wants to go. She's libfem (TWAW) who has actually been victimized by TIMs in sports - that's another story.  Anyway, she will still want to go, and I agreed to go in solidarity. I'm so angry. This shit has got to stop."", 'My first peak was during the pride parade 2012. I had heard alot about transexuals leading up to the event but you know, all I heard was that they are normal people, they just want to live like the opposite sex and I was like ""ok cool whatever I don\'t care"" anyway, there was alot of people in the city. It was basically shut off for the parade, I wasnt really joining the parade but I was in the city to do some errands with my 4 yo kid and I was like, let\'s stand and cheer them on! After a while my kid needed the bathroom, ok, well let\'s go to McDonalds (there were literally no other place with a bathroom) the queue was like 60 people long and everyone let us in the front because tiny child, you go ahead. There was only one bathroom, a single occupancy bathroom that was  marked as a handicap bathroom(this is very common where I live) and we were at the front of the queue. Anyway we were waiting and waiting and after 10 minutes and the bathroom still being occupied I started to worry, maybe someone fell in there, you know, it being a handicap bathroom. I knocked on the door, just two knocks, expecting to hear ""OCCUPIED"" or something yelled, but nothing. Just silence. I turned around and asked some dudes behind me if they knew if someone was in there? They didn\'t know, they had been standing there for 10 min before we came and the people in front of them had given up and left. Now this really concerned me someone was maybe in there for 20 min, not making any sounds and not answering to a knock and I asked the McDonalds staff if the bathroom was in  function, they said yes, it\'s in function and in use. I knocked a few more times now, but still no answer. Everyone in the line started picking up on this and worry too, people started asking the staff to make sure this person was ok and not lying there injured on the floor. It became quite a commotion and the staff started to knock and yell ""Hey are you ok?? Still no answer. They went to get the key to open the door but as they stepped away to find the key the door flung open and a very angry trans woman was basically lunging at me and yelling at me with their finger pointed right in my face "" WHO WAS KNOCKING IM GONNA PUNCH WHOEVER IT WAS"" mind you I\'m a tiny woman standing at 5""1 this guy was like 6""1! I was just backing away trying to put my child behind me, the dudes behind us in the line quickly stepped infront of me and my kid and started saying ""No idea dude those people left, nobody here was knocking calm down"" this freaks this person out even more they started yelling that they weren\'t a dude and they were in there so long because they just got their period??  I have no idea what would take so long if you indeed got your period but this was not anyone who had ever had a period anyway! This was the first time I realised something about this was very very wrong. I was shocked, shaking, my kid started to cry and freak out from all this commotion and hostility so I just snatched my kid up and went into the bathroom to calm him down and let him pee.\n\nAnd after this experience I was still an ally to the trans movement for 5 more years!! Because I\'m stupid.', 'I peaked a long time ago, and I already shared my trauma story in another post, but I had a recent encounter with a TIF online that really boiled me. I\'ve had a lot of transmen as friends over the years, I\'m butch so we can relate on a lot of stuff but just not the desire for maleness. But after this person I feel really jaded suddenly.\n\nSo I do art online, I do a lot of erotica with gay and lesbian couples because there is too much fetishization out there and I want to show that same sex couples are not just a fetish but can have loving, deeply intimate relationships. Kinda sappy but it helps me work through my trauma and makes me feel good. Anyway, I drew a lot of stuff of a couple this TIF liked, a gay couple, so they followed me for quite a while on twitter. At one point I came up with an idea to rewrite that couple as a lesbian couple, complete with how much harder their medieval fantasy life would be as women and especially gay women, and I drew a few pieces of that and wrote some thoughts I had about how much harder life would be for them in that kind of society as women. This person proceeded to send me anon hate, go off on their own blog about how I\'m just a cis lesbian and ""as a queer artist she should know better"" and I need to recognize that being a cis gay woman gives me privilege and blahblahblah. Just the usual gross libfem shit. After a little more digging I saw that not only do they interpret that same gay couple as a biological male with a transman, but they even try to push the idea that this ""man"" would let ""himself"" get pregnant. Essentially turning an established gay couple from a fantasy series into yet another straight couple. But I should know better, since I deigned to draw/write them as lesbians in an oppressive medieval society.\n\nI know fandom and gendercritical stuff doesn\'t overlap much so I tried to keep it in layman\'s terms and not use fandom specific slang. But yeah. Basically tl;dr a TIF told me reimagining a gay fantasy couple as a lesbian fantasy couple is disgusting and I need to check my privilege, meanwhile they want that gay couple to be straight and have babies.', 'I don\'t have a particular strong peak trans moment or if so I can\'t remember exactly where I peaked.\n\nI only remember being hyper supportive early teens up to 17. \n\nI was on tumblr was told multiple time the struggle of all LGBTQ+ and of course I support them no one deserves to be treated that way. \n\nI knew 2 FtM people in my high school one I knew very well coming from a family of all boys, was pretty chubby and strong and I think struggled with the idea of woman beside the curvy thin women wearing pink and make-up we are always blasted on by media and society. \nShe was lesbian then came out and became straight, changed his name, I of course was supportive 100%. \n\nI found myself attracted to none or I guess only liked the personality of people so I identified as pan, was full pro-porn, pro-trans, pro everything I was told about but it didn\'t stop me from doubting since day 1. \n\nI didn\'t understand how the trans agenda and the feminist agenda could work together. If feminist goal was to abolish gender so everyone could live free of societal bounds and achieve equality how could the main foundation of the trans agenda was built on using theses to confirm their identity.\n\n When people came back with the female brain and male brain I believed it was a joke. \nCome on you can\'t believe that, it was debunked years ago, no one is born with a female brain telling them to be ""nurturing"" society teach you and force you to conform to its expectations, it is socialisation. I was expecting people to laugh at it and reject it but I saw crowds just eating it up spouting it at anyone that could hear.\n\nThen came the invasion of female only space, shelters, toilets, changing rooms...\n\n I understand wanting to be accepted but you can\'t force yourself into space reserved for female bodied people that most traumas relies on violence they suffered at the hands of men. That would be highly hypocritical to demand access to them but at the same time denying access to your own reserved space because you fear too.\n\nMale criminals whose pasts were completely erased and ignored because they became women? You let a man who went into prisons for raping and murdering women into women only prison because now they identified as a woman and by such needs to be there?

Transwoman hijacking female sports teams and events because their biology is still giving them advantage over female physical biology and you were an average runner in male team don\'t worry just go to the female one you will crush everyone else. \n\nChanging history and transformating strong representative women into transmen because who would dare go to war if not a man. \n\nTelling kids to do life changing procedures because like all teens the change in your body makes you uncomfortable and society pressure gets stronger and they feel out of their body. \nWe don\'t know the long term effect of those products, I can\'t drink until 18 nor vote why should you give life changing for some non reversible treatment to someone underage?\n\nGiving therapy/counselling to deal with the roots of the problems yes! \nLetting them experiment with the life of the other side without physically harming them yes, explaining that liking truck don\'t make you a boy and skirt make you a girl because human beings come from various shapes and tastes and you are no less than a person for liking your stuff, yes! \n\nDamaging bodies with unknown chemicals that were not tested in long term and make them widespread, no! \n\nInternal misogyny of many FtM people?

Fast forward to a few years ago, I see another Domme ordering Her submissive to read Black Feminist Literature, and I decide to also brush upon Feminist Lit - because “Feminist” means “A woman who does whatever she wants, especially if it’s sexual,” right? \n\nKeep in mind, at this point, I’ve identified as a trans man since the year 2000 who decided not to transition for a myriad of reasons - think ‘The Hot Chick’, when the guy takes her body to make money. Never heard of non-binary at this point; I digress. My body and my spirit are two different things, but I don’t deny my body is female, just that my body defines me. \n\nSo, I’m VERY pro-trans, at this point, and one of my cousins from my mother’s past relationship comes out as a girl (even though we’re talking about an adult), and starts posting the most sexualized anime pics I have ever seen, speaking in uwu (i.e., “it me!”). All I remember wanting to comment is, “You identify as a sexual object? Because those aren’t actual women - those are cartoon fantasies.” This KEEPS HAPPENING, and my newly-educated brain is just so offended, I end up blocking the profile, just so I’m not tempted to “say something transphobic” and bring the wrath of the kink community (the same one that sided with my rapist when I was drugged for turning him down and complaining that he wasn’t respecting my boundaries, after being groomed by a BDSM Chateau that currently has a class action lawsuit through the NCSF pending - I digress again) upon me. Mind you, I’m trying to run for the board, so I can turn it into a safe space - the one I didn’t have. \n\nThe penultimate straw - the one that pushed me to start to find a RadFem/ AFAB-only space - was getting dog-piled on for validating a micro-aggression experienced by an AFAB in a non-binary group. The OP in question was talking about someone who uses he/ him pronouns. A trans woman starts making it all about THEM. I remind everyone in the thread that the person we’re talking about is a “he”, and the trans woman goes OFF about how I am invalidating them. Literally, every card in the victim deck. When I get misgendered, I’m called a “colonizer” (even though my grandmother’s great-grandmother was raped by a Spanish Lord, which is why we started to pass) for correcting them. \n\nWhen I try to explain that (as the OP stated) an AFAB being complained to by an AMAB about “not being able to wear women’s clothes” in public without ridicule is patronizing and tone deaf, and it’s not transphobic to identify this as toxic masculinity, I get muted while everyone else in the thread continues to harass and ridicule me, basically turning my attempts at validation into the “Pick Me” Olympics. \n\nI explained everything to the Mod, how it’s messed up that, just because we don’t have transnormative language to express this sentiment doesn’t mean the OP is invalid for thinking, “Ugh - men.” The comments were either bashing the OP for not playing the semantics game correctly or trying to validate without bringing the wrath upon them that I ended up incurring. I was allowed to stay in the group,  namely because the Mod looked back at the thread and realized, yes, I had been bullied over a misunderstanding. \n\nThe very last straw - the one that made me not care if someone called me a TERF - was seeing a post on a call-out group that bashed a trans woman for *gasp* daring to call out trans misogynists! Literally, trans women who are misogynistic and make it a point to invade spaces and co-opt feminism to make it about them. I didn’t think I’d ever see a trans woman who was ACTUALLY a feminist, and, when I found one, surprise-surprise, she was being publicly shamed and made an example of, so as to deter further defection. She even went so far as to acknowledge she comes from a place of privilege being born in a male body, and feminism is for female-bodied people, first and foremost, and to listen to us when we talk about our experiences. This inspired me, with her permission (and a wonderfully-validating private conversation), to make a YouTube video and explain why she’s completely right. \n\nToday, I saw someone on Twitter try to call homosexuals bigots for making homosexual orientation “all about biological sex”, and was pleasantly surprised when the comments were full of people (including a few RadFem trans women, one of whom I followed a while back) calling out the bigoted nature of the post. This led me to find the term “Gender Critical”, and here I am. \n\nI’m still worried about using certain terms, if you can’t tell, and expressing myself in a way that’s different than how I’m used to speaking as of late, but I’m glad I found a space that’s actually Feminist. Everything I’ve read so far in the Wiki makes me want to cry tears of joy! I’m NOT alone, this push for Capitalist Feminism to replace anything that would cause real social change IS happening, and I’m not a bigot for calling out infantilizations and reenforcements of whitecishet patriarchal standards of beauty being mistaken for, and insisted on, being common politeness. \n\nSorry for the lengthy diatribe, this is just the first time I’ve been able to say these things ever and not have to immediately brace for backlash. As someone who studies Neurolinguistic Programming, I’m keenly aware that controlling how people are allowed to speak is the first step in controlling how they think and, therefore, behave. I hope to deprogram myself here. Been trying to get out of sex work as my main source of income for about seven years, going back to college to finish my degree and pursue being a writer of many mediums - who would have thought being sexually assaulted multiple times a night would make it hard to concentrate and make me think my only value is being sexual entertainment for men? \n\nThank you for existing!', 'After seeing the term TERF expand and calls to violence against them become more and more frequent, no choice other than to peak.', ""Several smal peak trans like some others here.

I remembered being her age, also quite tall and chubby, and how disconnected from my self I felt, how foreign and big and lumpy my dumb body was. So much of what is labeled as gender dysphoria is body dysmorphia, or simply a lack of comfort and confidence with your body, and it's something the majority of teenagers go through. I haven't said anything to her dad (I don't know him that well, just the stepmom), but if I hear of any talk about transitioning I'm going to have to speak up.

That lead to a whole other discussion about how to make the group more inclusive for trans members; one of the responses suggested it was bad that many of the posts in the group began with ""hey ladies"" and similar…. because we can\'t possibly assume that the people in a women\'s discussion group are in fact women, and can’t address them as such. Apparently. And to add to the whole thing, there was also a post in the group asking ""what\'s the worst thing about being a woman"" - there were absolutely no complaints about that, it only became a problem once the discussion was about positive things, and celebrating womanhood.\n\nI\'m all for people choosing however they want to live their lives, and identifying as whatever they want to identify as. I can empathise with the struggles of trans people. And I’m happy to use whatever pronouns people want me to use. But I’ve been feeling increasingly uneasy about a certain tone in some parts of the internet these days. It feels like walking on eggshells, and people are out to be offended by anything. It\'s like we have to go out of our way to please and accommodate trans people, otherwise we\'ll be branded a bigot. There’s no room for discussion, and no room for women talking openly about their experiences without having to stop and accommodate trans people. It all just seems wrong.', '[deleted]', 'This is going to be rather long so I apologize. I’ve avoided posting before because I didn’t think anyone would care about what I had to say (got to love female socialization!), but I just really need to vent right now because of something I saw today. \n\nTL;DR - the “cotton ceiling” is crap & lesbians’ sexual orientation should be respected.\n\nI keep thinking I’ve hit peak trans and then something new happens and it pushes me even further. Today I think I’ve hit the pinnacle of my peak trans moments.\n\nI’ll start off by saying that I tried to be a good ally to trans people. I’ve tried to understand even though I still don’t get most of it - seems to me like it’s just adherence to gender stereotypes (but that’s for another post). I do (and will continue to) use a person’s preferred name and pronouns because I see it as a small way to be respectful. I wouldn’t say I’m all the way a radfem yet but I’m definitely not a libfem. But what I think is important is that I’m critically questioning what TRAs are doing to reinforce the patriarchy and erase women’s (particularly lesbian) spaces instead of just blindly following a movement because other people tell me I’m a hateful monster if I dissent.\n\nOne of the ways I tried to be a good ally was to “re-examine my genital preferences.” I’m a lesbian (I will NEVER use the word “queer” and I hate that young lesbians are turning to the word “queer” because apparently lesbian=transphobic). I saw some YouTube video about how excluding pre-op MTFs from your dating pool is “transphobic” and this idea of the “cotton ceiling”. I immediately questioned it - I mean I had so much internalized lesbophobia that I tried and tried to be with men and the last straw was when I realized I could only have sex with them when I was totally drunk. But I didn’t want to make anyone feel bad so I did what they said and started thinking about why I was only sexually attracted to natal women. I read an article about how to have sex with pre-op transwomen and I was totally disgusted. I could not imagine myself doing any of the things they listed. I don’t care how much their “ladydick” is different from a male’s, it’s still a penis. And them calling lesbians “transphobic” or “vagina fetishists” really seems like some incel crap. I don’t call straight women homophobic because they don’t want to sleep with me - I respect their sexual orientation. \n\nHere’s the thing there are lesbians who will have sex with transwomen so instead of shaming the lesbians who aren’t interested, focus on finding someone who is (that’s almost like the whole concept of dating *eye roll*). \n\nSo this brings me to my peak trans moment. I was on a dating app today and I came across a profile that said “Tgirl looking for Cisgirls who like Tgirls.” So first problem is that a girl is a female child so you really mean to use the word woman for a female adult. But obviously the bigger issue is that this person gets to specify they want to date “ciswomen” (hate that word) and I’m sure nobody bats an eye because a trans person should never be questioned (*eye roll*). But other lesbians and I are berated because we will only date actual women. I guess I should be thankful that the person (probably) focuses on women who are interested in transwomen but it still made me angrier than I thought I could be at the whole trans thing. I will never again feel bad about myself because I refuse to be with a transwomen who has a penis.\n\nIf you made it this far into my rant, thank you! And if you didn’t that’s fine too because it’s really helped to actually be able to say this!', 'In my high and middle school, there was a boy.  He was morbidly obese, and he wielded it as a shield.  He was loud, sarcastic and disagreeable.  \n\nHe would interject himself into other people\'s conversations.  When he was told to go away, he would tell the teacher ""they\'re excluding me because I\'m fat.""  Oftentimes, we were told to let him play with us or sit with us.  \n\nFast forward to now.  We are not FB friends, but we are mutuals.  Someone shared his post.\n\nHe is now going by a female name and pronouns.  His photo is him in poorly done makeup and a bow in his hair.  \n\nMost of my friends are in college.  He works at a restaurant.  Transitioning will not solve his problems.  Although I worry he will use it to bully, just as he did with his obesity.', '[deleted]', 'This thread could be subtitled The Trans Mountain Range.', 'Shared my peak trans story on the previous thread but I am really struggling at the moment and just not sure where to turn. I have started trying to challenge some of my liberal feminist friends to start questioning some of the pro-trans ideology they are promoting and I feel like I just keep hitting a brick wall. They don’t want to read articles from former trans people, they don’t want to acknowledge the trans community that has spoken out against early transition, they don’t want any academic sources that contradict TRAs. I don’t know how to reach these women and I don’t know how to maintain relationships with them when we are so clearly at odds on a topic this rife with emotion.', 'Hi everyone! So I was mostly unaware of what was happening with transgender stuff for a while.\n\nI figured that most trans""women"" had some condition I didn\'t understand, or were otherwise gay men who were victimized by homophobic men. And as you know, when your research just scratches the surface, you find TRA centered results. So what I read told me that transgender people were very oppressed, facing an epidemic of violence, and they needed to use women\'s spaces to be safe. I didn\'t love the idea of sharing our spaces with people born and raised male, but I didn\'t think too much of it. Besides, there were other issues I was focused on like abortion access and kavanaugh etc.\n\nEarlier this year, I went to a work conference. The facilitator, who I considered a fellow feminist, publicly called JK Rowling a terf.\n\nI looked it up and decided it was ridiculous to call her a slur for thinking that rapist TIM Karen White should not be housed in a women\'s prison. That led me to question any other assumptions I had made about trans issues.\xa0\n\nAround the same time, I found myself mysteriously and involuntarily subbed to [r/transtimelines](https://mail.google.com/r/transtimelines).  In their pre-transition photos, so many TIMs looked like total privileged men to me. Like, if I would see those guys in real life, I\'d know that they would never, ever understand my experience as a woman. And for many of them, they look like the type of guy I would actively avoid. Toxic men. But all of them were men who grew up with privilege, entitlement, and opportunities that women don\'t enjoy, and free from the relentless cultural message women are taught of being subordinate in every way. How dare they call themselves women and demand access to female spaces and resources?\n\nI again made efforts to educate myself on this issue and understand where they were coming from. I just couldn\'t get over this cognitive dissonance. Online trans groups were full of people hating on women and feminists. And anyone who questioned it were smeared publicly.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, I found this sub and radical feminism. Peak Trans!\xa0Funny how my impulse to accept TIMs and understand where they were coming from (and their handmaidens) pushed me to this point.\n\nI have considered myself a feminist ever since I learned the meaning of the word as a child. Now, I am having a feminist reawakening, in a large part due to this sub. Thank you so much. Solidarity, sisters!', 'I was watching the reboot of Designated Survivor on Netflix. The president\'s wife\'s is dead. She leaves behind a son and daughter. In one episode part of the plot is about that young lady getting her period for the first time. It\'s a delicate subject. So what do they do? Make it about the TIM\'s fantasy life!\n\nIt turns out the president the president has a TIM in-law and it\'s found out. So of course the TIM has to come to the White House and have a long talk with him. At one point he says to the president if he accepts him viscerally. It reminded me of my grandparents talking about accepting Jesus into your heart. It\'s the same stupid belief system complete with emotional coercion in the name of alleged morality. Meanwhile the president of course asks the TIM to come and be his daughter\'s new ""mom."" They show the TIM talking to the girl later and giggling as if said TIM were a teenage girl. I wanted to throw up watching it. \n\nIt\'s all such a gross and disgusting episode. The last thing most normal parents want is having some messed up male have a conversation with their daughter about her experiences. Real bravery would have been the president becoming a rad fem. Having him tell the man it is grossly offensive for him to even bring up this stuff with his daughter. But everything everywhere has to be about catering these creepy men and their pathetic delusions. The episode concludes with a clumsy speech about privacy as if we can\'t all tell the TIM is a TIM. It was all very Orwellian and rather viscerally off putting.', ""Every time that I think that it can't get any worse, my peak, peaks."", ""Sorry, I just need to vent this!

I did not want to see that. I'm so fucking mad and repulsed. No doubt he was praised for being 'brave'.\n\nI'm so fucking mad at these narcissistic assholes just pushing their fetish in people's faces.

(For context: the post was a TiM posting a selfie in a Smash Bros Facebook group. Absolutely NOTHING to do with transgenderism or requiring a selfie but they infiltrate everything.). \n    \nHere is my comment with my peak trans moment story:  \n  \n\nOkay so here is something I’ve noticed.  \n   \nIf you’re on Facebook in a lot of “tag groups” (like meme groups etc) you’ll notice a lot have very specific names or are about specific things, for example about McChicken burgers or about cats being fat or about second hand store finds - you get the picture.  \n  \nAlmost all these tag groups are apart of “left book”. They have the most ridiculous loaded entry questions to groups seemingly unrelated, for example joining a group about milkshakes but having to answer how many genders there are. It’s a huuuge echo chamber and quick to call anyone terfs (which is ironic as I had never even heard of the term but got called one, got annoyed at how all the trans people/their hand maidens jumped on me for an innocent period comment, google search and ya look where I ended up).   \n  \nANYHOO. Something I and other people have noticed: literally no matter **what** the subject of the group, trans people need to bring themselves up, their ideology or insert themselves somehow.  \n  \nClassic example: a Facebook group about McChickens. All anyone did was post a photo of their McChicken burger. Until a TiM came along and uploaded selfies. Then people started laugh reacting, saying he was a man — but hundreds of people calling everyone TERFs etc etc. heaps of people got banned and they got uwu validated. Literally no one else posted selfies bar like maybe 1 or 2 ladies every few weeks. Suddenly a huge influx of trans people would then post selfies with burgers and get all these comments “you girls are GORGEOUS”.   \n  \nAnyway one TiM in particular must have been eating McDonald’s at least 4 times a week and uploading a selfie each time. I remember once comment he made like “wait until I grow tits so I can do slutty pictures too”.   \n  \nFuck it just pisses me off how they *infiltrate everywhere*. Like a fucking germ or fungus, spreading everywhere and contaminating everything. *Not everything has to do with being trans*. If they really wanted to be left alone they would transitioning and get on with it, not draw attention to it every waking moment.  \n  \nThe good thing is is so many people peak trans because of them. So many - like myself - had literally never heard of TERF, considered themselves an LGBT ally etc.   \nThen I got attacked because I shared a meme about periods with the caption “ladies” (as in ladies, how relatable). Got the “NOT ALL WOMEN MENSTRUATE” thing “TERF”. Immediately I felt angry not “educated”. I was like uhhh yeah fuck off you’re biologically wrong. I remember googling something like “aggressive trans people” and stumbling down gender critical. TERF in 12 hours!

So I live in Hollywood, I guess you could call me a casual filmmaker and am lucky to live around a lot of similarly creative people in their 20s, 30s who create for the sake of creating. Filmmaking is expensive business. Consequently, a lot of us end up doing favors for one another, and when my friend asked me to be in an experimental film about femicide of course I said yes. I got up at 6am on a Sunday and made my way to the pickup where she'd be waiting to collect me and a group of her friends who were also volunteering. I get there and there are two women and a 6ft, broad, balding white guy. I assume he's crew and since my friend is running late, I make small talk. The first thing this guy tells me about himself?

&#x200B;

\> ""I look really broey but I'm actually non binary""

&#x200B;

Ugh. Really? I immediately see where this is going. I've never heard a gay or lesbian person immediately state their sexuality or gender or whatever with absolutely no prompting so I'm already not feeling optimistic about how the rest of this day is going to go. The whole ride to the set I try and steer clear of any woketalk and we talk about industry stuff instead. We get into our costumes and he seems utterly delighted when he's given a sheer pink shirt and a tight midlength skirt. There are a handful of other women there and one or two purr patronizingly at the stunning brave man in a skirt. When filming begins he starts in on the gender thing again, and I notice the director keeps positioning him in the middle of scene, so he's the focus. Again, it's her project so no arguments from me, but I can't imagine why such an obvious man would be included in this project. I decide to just put it out there.

&#x200B;

'Yeah, I'm actually gender critical and don't believe in gender at all.'

&#x200B;

He whips his head back so hard that the director has to come and reposition. He asks me to explain and I do, and I can see it turning it over his mind. I tell him that literally everyone is 'non binary' and that no one can opt in or out of oppression. 

&#x200B;

""That's definitely a perspective I've never heard before...""

&#x200B;

But then he recycles every bit of propaganda he's heard to make himself feel special. How it's an internal feeling, how third genders have existed for thousands of years yadda yadda. I try and explain that you are yourself and it seems more sexist to reinforce the idea that if, as he said, you don't feel like 'one of the guys' then you must simply not be one, despite appearing to everyone as a well built white male. He told me how he hardly ever tells anyone about his 'identity' but that his pronouns were important, and I told him it seemed very narcissistic to make everyone around you bend their language in a way that doesn't make sense just to satisfy yourself. I could see him squirming, and grasping for compliments like his qweer friends undoubtedly shower him with, he asks me what I think about his dress. I tell him I don't like it, and he asks if it was the color.

I got the sense that he was a confused bisexual who was actually pretty boring and only had his 'identity' to make him more interesting, consequently making him even more dull. He was extremely self absorbed and his handmaidens were just fueling it.

So yeah, it finally happened. The area I live in has a very high transgender population, so I've had a ton of interactions with them, almost all of them involving t hem threatening me out of nowhere or talking about sex immediately after meeting, but this is one of the first NB, and yeah.

co1n5a,co1n5a,"Most men are unable to consider their thoughts and emotions objectively. If it’s in his head, it must be true","(English is not my mother tongue, sorry for errors) 
I work as a therapist. A major thing I learned in training is the importance of mentalization (similar to theory of mind) for mental health. Mentalization is a term for the mental capacities that enables us to understand ourselves and others, have empathy , plan ahead and control our emotions and emotional expression. Increasing mentalization is a major goal in therapy as it is like strengthening the necessary muscles required to handle challenges and symptoms.
Mentalization requires you to objectively consider the truthfulness and validity of your thoughts and emotions. This is important as it enables you not to act impulsively and not maintain anxiety and depression which is often /always based on unhelpful feelings and appraisals. 

When you consider non clinical populations it just strikes me how this seems to come more naturally for women. We are especially taught  to examine the validity of our emotions from an early age. “Are you sure your not overreacting?”  “ He didn’t mean it like that” “are you pms’ing again?”. This in turn creates a lot of girls and women who becomes hypercritical of her own emotions and reactions while at the same time hyper-mentalizing others (especially men’s) intentions. She second guesses herself and tries desperately to make sense of why the men in her life treats her the way they do, giving benefit of the doubt and looking within herself to find the answers to their behavior.

Male socialization on the other hand deals much differently with these issues. The broad cultural message given to boys from our sexist society is that he is the protagonist of his own story, he must always be logic and rational, as long as he considers issues with thoughts and cognition and not emotions he will always be logical and right, and as he is always logical, his emotional experiences are always valid as they result from what he perceives as his logical beliefs.

I believe differences like these can help explain why men seem so unable to empathize with and understand women’s experiences. We see all the time here on reddit how men are unable to even respect that a woman may perceive situations differently than they do. This is most extreme in the manosphere of course, where men boast about how they don’t see women as humans. But, I believe mentalization capabilities  plays a part in leading these men to the manosphere. 

Consider the anger of nice guys and incels who believe they have been mislead about what a woman wants in a man. Boy is told by his mom that he needs to be nice and considerate to get a date. This makes sense to boy, so he now believes it. Boy is unable to get a date. Boy becomes angry. Instead of analyzing the theory he has in his head, like, idk take an honest look at both his social skills and whether he might have oversimplified the theory, he feels angry. As he is angry, and unable to assess this anger rationally, the resulting conclusion is that he has been wronged. This feels true, so it must be. The interplay between the emotion (anger) and thought applied to it (I have been wronged) becomes a never ending loop he is unable to escape, as he has little training in assessing cognitions rationally. 

This is dragging on so ill close with one last example. Men refusing to believe that women have our own set of problems in sex and dating. Because men believe that a woman can always have sex, she is privileged and lives life on easy mode. The man wants sex more than anything, therefore sex is truly the key to happiness and women have nothing to complain about. Even though he claims to understand evo-psych (these men loooove the bio-truths that validates their toxic masculinity), he cannot fathom how women find being pumped and dumped upsetting, as he himself would love to be ‘used for his body’. This feels true, so it must be. As a logical male, the conclusion is that women are so spoilt and irrational they are completely unable to see how good they have it and the logical explanation for a woman’s dating woes is always due to her hypergamous nature. Never mind the fact that studies have shown that men are actually incapable of even noticing unattractive women (another thing he’ll never know due to his mentalization deficits)

Thank you.\n\nA thought came to me: men sometimes insist that dating and romance are soooo easy for women, and don’t listen if women explain that it’s not so easy at all. My theory is that men think their own perception of the world is real, and they only notice hot women. Ordinary or “unattractive” women or women outside their target age range, basically don’t exist for them, they’re like grayed-out NPCs. You see this sometimes in trans discussions, where someone will claim that being a girl is like playing life on easy mode. I think they really believe this, because they only actually notice very attractive women, and they assume that “all girls” are having that experience of being pursued, and no men are (so unfair). What they fail to observe is  that men also come in very hot and more average subsets, and life for the hot ones is probably more like that episode of 30 Rock where Liz meets the extremely hot, extremely sheltered-by-his-beauty guy. They also can’t grasp that they are only seeing the outside of being a hot woman, they have no idea what’s really going on for her, due to their low empathy and poor theory of mind.\n\nIt feels like there’s some thought process like:\n\n1 hot girls are the only girls that exist, because I ignore everyone else\n\n2 life appears to be easy for (hot) girls, by which I mean that they get a lot of sexual attention \n\n3 life is so hard for me, an unattractive male, by which I mean that I feel entitled to receive a lot of fawning attention and sex but don’t get it\n\n4 I should transition! Transitioning will make me a hot girl because all girls are hot\n\n5 now I’m a girl so I’m hot UWU\n\n6 why aren’t people chasing me like they chase hot girls?

I'm 23 years old, female (luckily) and from the US. 
 
I've always been a tomboy but still kind of ""feminine"" in how I presented myself, at least until I got into college at 18, it was a pretty liberal college so I got into contact with some new ideas for me because I'm from a quite conservative/republican family. 

Being the impressionable young girl that I was I quickly got into the feminist mindset common on the campus, which maybe wasn't a totally bad thing but then something else happened and I really learned about transgenderism. 

Now for me as somebody who has been always kind of uncomfortable in my own body with ""typically male interests"", this felt like the obvious solution. 

My college offered a therapist everybody could talk to for a short time once a month, so I talked to him and he was immediately on board with the idea of me being transgender and suggested that I should visit a ""specialist"". 

Which is what I did, she immediately started suggesting that I should transition even without really talking too much about it, so I did. 

After a month or so I came out as trans, my environment in the college was super accepting and even ""praised"" me for being ""so brave"". 

On the other hand, it  quickly destroyed my relationship with my parents, but at the time I felt like they were just stupid and tried to force me into traditional gender roles. 

I started living as a male fulltime and I got a breast removal at 20, which is still one of my biggest regrets. Now luckily for now, probably thanks to my relatively intensive workout routines at the time, I passed pretty well  without taking T, which I only started about a month before my breakdown which got me out of this mess.

At 22 I graduated from college and got into my first job, I work in software development. 

With this job I got into a pretty close relationship with a co-worker which I would describe as a good guy friendship, at least from his side. 

But for me in my head it started being more and more, I got romantically involved, at least in my head, but none of the thoughts in my head really matched who I thought I was. 

In every little day dream I had I was a woman, I thought about having a family with him and everything. You could say that I gota bit crazy. 

Now I've to add that I thought that I was into women until this point. 

To suppress the thoughts above, I started taking T about 2 month ago which kind of pushed me above the edge. 

I've realized how massively I've fucked up and I only feel massive regret. 

I'm lonely, have mutilated my own body and I can't even describe how terrible I feel.

It seems like people who are considering transitioning are immediately referred to a specialist simply because the therapist can get in a lot of trouble if they do anything but issue a referral. The whole nonchalant attitude by the medical community over giving people permanent, life altering surgeries and hormones is really very appalling to me.\n\nIn my opinion, when people talk about gender fluidity, they are really just talking about the kind of major changes that tend to happen in terms of how a person sees themselves over the course of their life. Gender dysphoria is really just body dysmorphia. In the past, there was a very high barrier to getting these treatments, and the rate of regret was low simply because people had to be so committed to doing it before they could find medical professionals willing to do it. Plus, people were much older before these things were being done to them. \n\nBut the fact of the matter is it is incredibly common for people to change their mind about these kinds of things as they get older. Something like half of women who say they don’t want children when they are younger change their mind later on, for example. As a result, it is incredibly difficult to convince a doctor to do a tubal ligation until you are well into your ‘30s. And I think that’s how it should be with transitioning. Supposedly they are supposed to do no harm, but these kinds of permanent changes will definitely be harmful if the patient changes their mind about their identity later in,\n\nYou didn’t do anything wrong. You didn’t make a mistake. You got bad medical advice from unscrupulous doctors. You’re not alone, this happens all the time. This is a huge up and coming scandal.

However, masculinizing yourself further (using T) seems like a case of ""jumping out of the frying man and into the fire!"" You\'re going to make yourself even *less* attractive to a heterosexual male, if that\'s where you\'re heading. How about simply maintaining the status quo (i.e., get off the T) while sorting out your sexual orientation with a therapist? If you can\'t stop spinning your wheels over an imaginary life with your co-worker, you and she can find an anti-depressant that cuts down on your obsessive thoughts. Most anti-depressants work on OCD as well as anxiety in general.

bybaaj,bybaaj,London Attack Against Lesbian Couple is SOMEHOW About Transwomen According To Humans Rights Campaign,"On the Humans Rights Campaign Twitter account, they announced their knowledge of the recent attack on a lesbian couple in a London bus and wrote the following:

&#x200B;

>The brutal attack on a same-sex couple for refusing to kiss in front of a group of men is a direct result of latent and widespread misogyny and homophobia.

&#x200B;

Agreed! But then:

&#x200B;

>This epidemic of hate violence against LGBTQ people and trans women worldwide must end now.

???????????? I just. What? First of all, aren't trans women a part of the T and the overall mixed acronym community we got going on here? Why the separation? It just looks so fucking weird seeing it just below the graphic photo of the two bloodied women. It would make anyone look at it and think, ""Oh, those must be the trans women that this account is talking about.""

They're not trans. They're lesbians. Big difference. Language is so powerful and these groups of people are abusing it, not caring one bit about the couple who were brutalized and instead wanted to turn this into another ""but what about the trans wimmin tho?"" conversation.

caqrzw,caqrzw,I'm a therapist who works in cosmetic surgery and wanted to share some thoughts,"I've been a therapist (""psychotherapist"") for 20 years, and working as a consultant for cosmetic surgeons for the past 10 years. I am a woman and a feminist, I'm not sure I'd call myself a radical feminist for various ideological reasons but I am certainly not a fan of popular feminism and I agree with the majority stance of this sub.    

I wanted to share some of my experiences and thoughts with you just because I thought some readers might find them interesting and they could be a useful insight.    
The vast majority of patients I work with are having simple procedures and there is A LOT i could say about that but it seems very obvious to me. I don't think I need to tell you all about the motivations behind wanting to look ""perfect"". I did want to share a little bit about my insight into trans procedures so I'll just type that out and take it as you will...    

I started working in cosmetics because of an experience with one patient. She had an eating disorder and had had breast implants. Her old therapist gave me her notes before I started seeing her. From them it seemed like she had got the implants for 2 reasons:    

1. She had experienced sexual abuse in her early teens. Now, seeing her 'flat' chest made her still feel like a child and constantly triggered traumatic memories. She also worried that any partner she had must fetishise her breasts for looking pre-pubsecent and felt re-victimised by that.    

2. She was concerned by the prevailing western image of what an attractive woman is. Her eating disorder started as a teen and meant she did not develop breasts, but her pelvis did widen, and as an adult she felt 'out of proportion' because of this.    

The second issue was easy to contend with for obvious reasons that I won't bother explaining in this sub.    

The first issue is complex and I was interested to get to know her and help her. She had come to me because her previous therapist was supportive of her getting implants, but then she regretted them, and she wanted to see a new therapist after that.    

Some of her issues were: don't like feeling foreign objects inside my body, my back hurts, bras are uncomfortable, unwanted sexual attention, scars.    

My initial stance was to let her know that these are problems women with natural breast feel too, that it wasn't specific to her surgery. We also discussed the difficulty with 'foreign objects', that is a known issue and something therapist will spend time on with patients who need implanted devices for medical reasons.    

The longer we worked together the more I realised that her attempts to fix her psychological issues by altering her body were numerous and ineffective. Initially I had thought that the surgery could - although maybe not the best route- help with her childhood sexual trauma. But then I learnt of her many other ways of altering her appearance, always in the hope that something would change. and i realised she was desperate for a physical change to be able to change her mental state.    

this had started before her sexual abuse and once we found the root cause we were able to work on it, and she understood why it wasn't helpful, why it hadn't helped initially and why it would never help with her trauma.     

she ended up getting her implants removed and we stopped working together after nearly 3 years, with her being in a very good place.
this inspired me to work in cosmetics.    

here all cosmetic surgery patients must see a therapist. its about money and the law, medical staff can't have patients saying they weren't in their right mind and demanding reparations. but i actually wanted to make a positive difference.     

so i've been working in this area for the past 5-6 years, and have seen many trans patients in that time.     

the rise in the number of these patients has caused a great amount of discussion and i joined a group of therapists in this area who discuss their experiences and analysis of what's going on.
i'll share my experience here     

i don't work in a specific gender clinic so are that in mind, these are my experiences at a private cosmetic surgery.    

male wanting to be female patients: overwhelmingly come in for breast implants. usually no real desire to 'live as a woman' but very motivated by sexual pleasure of breasts. they have intense and distracting fantasies about 'being a woman' during sex- this means they want a man to have sex with them as if they were a woman (but anal sex ofc). They also enjoy the idea of masturbating whilst touching the breasts they want to have, and of sexual encounters where a man or woman fondles these breasts.     

In these cases I usual requests further sessions on the basis that their desire is sexually-motivated and may cause dissatisfaction in the rest of their lives. usually, after a few sessions, patients desist in their desire for the procedure. we talk about their motivations and how making decisions that impact your whole life off of sexual desire can be damaging and unhelpful. sometimes there's a need to talk about past trauma but overwhelmingly there is no trauma. also overwhelmingly there is a high instance of porn use and specifically lesbian porn with sado-masochistic elements. my analysis, in 99% of these patients, is unfulfilled sexual desire leading to porn use,  leading to distorted views of sexuality.    

female wanting to be male: i have never seen a patient in this situation who did not experience some type of childhood sexual abuse. Perhaps that is statistically likely given how common an experience this is for women. But in 10 years to never have a patient who wasn't abused by a man as a child/adolescent is significant in my opinion. Overwhelmingly the desire is to appear more masculine to evade abuse and gain acceptance, sometimes dominance. In my sessions discussion would always come back to their belief that men have better lives, more opportunities, less to fear. They frequently stated that they would not have been abused if they were male. They also often had eating disorders (mostly starvation, sometimes over-eating to obesity) related to how they felt there bodies may have invited abuse. I would of course explain that the of their abuse was their abuser, not anything they did or how they looked. Often, maybe 75%, patients are lesbians who feel they would be more attractive to women by presenting 'as a man', and this was usually concurrent with being raised in a culture with stigmatism against homosexuality. The procedures offered in the area I work in include facial surgery, implants, sculpting liposuction. Not genital surgery so it wasn't often discussed so i won't comment as it would just be isolated cases.     

That's all I have for now    
    
edit: I said ""...but in 10 years..."", to clarify, its been almost 6 years for me in this field, just typing naturally i said 10 because for about 4 years I was studing/taking exams to be able to work in this specific area of therapy",583,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

Eventually one day I broke down in tears while having sex with someone, ran out of his house and never went partying again. I wasn\'t healed, no matter how much I tried to pretend I was by drinking, partying and having sex with men who saw me as nothing more than a fleshlight. Because of all the sexual attention my breasts got me, I started blaming them for my rape. I thought that if I had a flat chest, I would not have been raped and I wouldn\'t have been so sexualised afterwards. I started hiding them in way too many layers and wearing bras designed to flatten them. I actually ended up fainting on a street corner because I refused to take off a hoodie in 40 degree Spanish heat (that\'s about 105 degrees Fahrenheit) because I didn\'t want anyone to see my breasts.

', 'I am so glad OP has decided to do what she wants in life and is reaping the rewards of not bending to the pressure to have a child. However I want to take issue with the two most common reasons people give for not having children. The first is that the world is ""fucked up"", the world has always been fucked up, it will always be fucked up and even if it seemed like it wasn\'t at any point in human history, things can change drastically in a heartbeat. The second is that the only way to responsibly have children is if you are well off and totally mentally sound. Both financial and emotional stability are illusions, both can come crashing down at any moment. The way to responsibly have children is to want them, to love them, protect them and to creatively negotiate any issues along the way. Some of the best parents can be both dirt poor and mentally ill (they can also be some of the worst), some of the worst parents can be ""financially and emotionally stable"". The most logical reason not to have kids is either overpopulation or simply not wanting them and particularly the belief that only the financially stable are responsibly bringing children into the world is an insult to poor but wonderful parents.', 'Huh, you mean the alt-right (I.e. Lauren Southern) telling women they need to get married in their early twenties and have as many kids as possible were wrong??? Who would have thought? /s', 'The fact is the ""freedom"" of being single is only possible if you have a high income, and that is a small minority of women overall.  If a woman is not born into affluence or has one job she has worked at her whole life, specifically in public employment in order to have a decent pension (I am thinking of the US here), she is  at huge risk for being destitute in old age.\n\nWhen I say ""freedom,"" I mean freedom to pretty much do what one wants without having to worry about nickel and diming everything.  Travel is much harder to afford if you are alone.  You are at risk of losing everything if you lose your job or have a health crisis, and there is no second income to act as a buffer against destitution.  Buying real estate is pretty much out of the question if you are a single woman--not in a shack-up situation with a man--because housing costs have been way out of whack since the mid-1970s with the influx of women in the labor force, making it difficult if not impossible to buy a stick house on a lot. If women can afford real estate, it is typically a condo or a manufactured home, both of which often don\'t appreciate with time like a stick house on a lot.   You don\'t get discounts for anything just because you are single, and that is a bigger chunk out of your income.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of these obvious facts, a result of the denigration of women\'s work by our male-dominated economy to force women into economic dependence on men, few women go a lifetime doing it alone.  Most straight single women wind up in cohabitation relationships with men, often lasting decades, just because they can\'t make it financially by themselves.  They aren\'t really ""single,"" only legally speaking.\n\nThere is no point sugarcoating it.  Financially speaking, being a never-married woman sucks.  Not fun to be  a victim of wrongful termination and having to work until I die with an income of less than half what I made a decade ago and  sleeping on my brother\'s couch.', 'I am not, myself, in the ""what a great choice it was to have kids"" phase of life, so can really identify with this idea!\n\nHowever, I also have a few practical considerations to raise, as someone who works full-time with seniors who struggle to stay independent in their advancing years.\n\nFor the majority of aging people, their adult children are their primary source for providing grocery shopping, transportation, home repair, yard maintenance, bill-paying, and all the other little and big chores that go into being able to survive outside institutional care.  Adult children also often care enough to make sure that, when mom or dad starts to face challenges, they search out appropriate supports, whether that includes meals on wheels, home health aides, companion/homemaker services, etc.  When a parent has medical problems, physical or mental, there is a great deal of coordination of care involved, and, again, the child is usually the one who cares enough to do it (for instance, even making sure that a person\'s meds are appropriate and taken on time can be a full-time job!).\n\nIf I were looking at a future for myself that did not involve children or a spouse, I would make sure that I had supports in place for the inevitable day that my physical (and possibly mental) capacities would decline.  This might mean, for instance, joining a ""co-housing"" senior community, or at the least finding a small, easily accessible apartment within walking distance of shopping and the bus.  I would also be sure that I had a good core of reliable friends and acquaintances, and that I was part of some sort of social community, whether that is a faith community, a tight-knit neighborhood, or another group.  Finally, growing older without built-in family supports is expensive, if you have to start paying people to do all the things that you previously did yourself.  I would make sure I had ample retirement savings and good financial planning if possible.\n\nI watch people grow old, alone, every day.  Although there are many things about it that must feel quite liberating, there are also practical aspects that should be anticipated and planned for, if a person hopes to age with dignity and some measure of grace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n ', ""Parent here and love my kids, but the fact I get a lot less frustrated and angry at other people's kids speaks volumes, maybe there should be an OPK movement where you can just pay for their college without the daily headaches,you know out of pity,  let me know if you're up for that.

As I\'m sure you\'d want them to look after you when you\'re old and lose your ability to take care of yourself.\n\nBut!  You don\'t HAVE to do a damn thing for them from age 18 onward.  Yes, you\'re a mother forever, but you don\'t have to do motherING, ya follow me?  The childfree act like it\'s a life sentence and they don\'t even know what parenting is like.  It never lives like it looks from the outside.  Never.  You lose a lot when you don\'t grok context.\n\nI mean, parents and friends and partners are a gigantic PITA at times too.  There\'s no ""family-of-origin-free"" or ""friend-free"" political movement, you ever notice that?\n\nI agree that most of what makes being a mother shitty is the father\'s near-total lack of cooperation or help, and society\'s refusal to support us.\n\nI also agree that women (or men) dead-set against procreation absolutely should not procreate.  I don\'t want to hear you whining 20 years from now that you got sterilized (if you chose to), mind you, but by all means, that\'s too much responsibility even for 18 years to take it lightly.  Just like don\'t get a cat if you\'re not going to clean its litter box.  But don\'t cry that you don\'t have a cat, either.\n\nThese things are always more complex than they look.\n\nAnd FYI I didn\'t have such an exciting life when I was single and childless.  I was broke.  I was in the military and hated it there.  My parents didn\'t want me around because I was a burden.  (Never mind I was the better-behaved of the two household sproglings.)  Men were assholes.  If anyone had ever stopped and said to me, ""You know, you could travel and see the world,"" and gave me advice on how, my life would have been very different, but we lower-class ""trash"" girls/women don\'t have mentors like that, ever.  We are just supposed to do scut work until we wear out and die.  Fucking yay.\n\nNow I\'m 45, kid will be 18 in another 4 years and I have no fucking idea what I will do then.  Having kids bankrupts you unless you started out with money and a good job, and I had neither.  I\'ll be running that catch-up-for-retirement treadmill for the following 30 years, I\'m afraid.  Again, fucking yay.\n\nAnd none of this was because I made a choice.  Or not just because of that.  The real story\'s always more complex than it looks.

azakld,azakld,I got kicked out of the gay group at my school and my friends don't want to talk to me anymore.,"Hi everyone, i'm sorry if this post is childish or if i make mistakes english is not my first language. i'm 13 and a half almost 14 and i'm a lesbian and i'm in high school. I want to make this post here because i got yelled at in my twitter but somebody said to make it here so nobody knows who i am. 

I participate in a gay club in my school, it's where i met all my friends. In this club we discuss lgbt problems, culture and we try to do charity or something and most of the members are LGBT there are only two allies. A trans girl joined us two months ago, she takes hormones and she wears dresses and paints her nails and has changed her name but she still looks like a boy. I used to wear a lot of makeup because i felt bad about my face (i dont anymore!) and she became my friend because she wanted me to teach her how to put makeup on and be a girl and i said yes. But then she started being really weird like she would ask about my period and my breasts or my body in a weird way and i didn't know why she was asking those questions because we didn't have the same body she doesn't get a periodd. She would also talk about her genitals a lot and it was gross because i hate penis. I stopped being her friend and stopped talking to her for a while. 

Last week she sent me a message to ask me to be her girlfriend but i said no because un)- i didn't like her and two)- the message was very weird she was talking about kissing me and stuff and she's seventeen! she's very older than me. After i said no she kept asking if it is because she was trans but i didn't answer her. She made a report about me to the club and they said i have to apologize but i said no and now they say i can't be in the club because i make trans friends feel weird. And my friends don't want to talk to me anymore because they say i was very rude to her except my gay best friend he says i don't have to apologize or talk to her anymore and he left the club but now their calling him rude too. 

I don't know what to do i feel very sad but i am not going to apologize i don't think i did anything wrong! a woman on twitter said i can find good advice here so please give me advice and if you are that woman hi and thank you. also i'm really sorry about the bad english!

I urge you to join gender critical spaces such as this one, r/truelesbians is another GC-like subreddit but it's just lesbians who also don't want to include trans people in their spaces.

They are saying that you should choose a strategy because so much else is inappropriate here, but this group allowed and supported a male to flirt with an underage lesbian, and that's not okay. Lesbians are being driven underground, partly because of our groups and institutions betraying us like this. You have a right to be angry about that. It will probably get worse before it gets better.  \nYou're under 14, I'd talk to your parents, the school admin etc. about someone sending you sexual messages about being their girlfriend. This is what bullying looks like, and he is trying to bully you into dating him and that club is going along with it. I mean, use the 'she' pronouns or whatever you need to do to live, but find an adult who will support you. Also, try to figure out what you want to have happen - do you want this person expelled? What typically happens in bullying situations? Do you want to transfer schools? Do you want the club's leadership to change? Do you want them to explicitly say it's okay for lesbians to not date transwomen? Do you want to rejoin? Would your parents support you?

Of these 7 doctors, just the ministry children alone would mean about 71 children per doctor. The average psychologist sees 25 patients a week, which means they can't possibly be seeing these children on a frequent basis.

There are several issues with Dr. Wallace Wong. He's been recorded saying that his youngest client is not even three years old. He's also been recorded instructing parents to pull the suicide card if the department does not immediately agree to puberty blockers and cross hormones.

501 foster care children are about to have their fertility and health destroyed with no one to defend them. One client not in foster care was court ordered to receive hormones against her father's wishes. 

This is Catholic Church level abuse. It is a scam, a racket, and should involve not just license stripping but JAIL TIME.

I'm not linking to the news stories because only the conservative media is reporting this. I understand why we don't want to give them clicks, but for me, it just made GC communication and awareness more difficult, more policed, and worked to the benefit of TRAs, and no one else. Their facts came from Dr. Wong's own public statements at the Vancouver Public Library. Since progressive media has pretty much abandoned us for the sake of wealthy AGPs we may have to plug our noses and get our information where we can, while we build up our own outlets. (That get banned).

He's already shut down his personal website for speaking tours and books, but his clinic is still up and open for new clients. 

Canadian citizens really, really need to seek transparency for how their foster care system functions, and how quacks are able to acquire tax money. They have a right to know what safeguards are missing.

“This ‘not all women have vaginas’ thing is the new ‘not all men’.”

“Christ. Leave her alone. She's speaking about her experience of womanhood and does not require your ‘not all men’ing.”

“But women do have vaginas.  And you should respect that they have the right to name their body parts.  It is pretty sad for you to say this to us.”

“Always ready to jump in and correct a female! How lovely. All women have vaginas. All people with vaginas are women are girls. We can’t identify out of oppression that happens because of our sex.”

“STOP TRYING TO SHUT US UP! we need space to discuss this shit and you being the women/vagina police isn't fucking helpful. YOU ARE ENABLING THE PERPETRATORS OF THE VIOLENCE.”

There are 15-30 people in each class. I have 5 classes. The number of students that demand different pronouns increases every year. That's a lot of special pronouns to remember.

I was in one of my classes and a girl with long hair, earrings, and makeup was in my group for an assignment. She had gone to somewhere else in the room and I said in front of the teacher ""she went to \_\_\_\_"". There was an awkward moment where I was looked at as if I had just said something very inappropriate. The teacher said ""she told us she goes by they/them in the ice breaker, please do not use she"". I can't even remember the ice breaker because I had 4 others which involved the same pronoun BS.

There is another girl who wears makeup, chokers, and skirts but asked us to call her ""he/him"" and refers to herself as a ""guy"".

Two boys that have buzzcuts and wear typical male clothes want to be called ""they/them"".

And several others that usually demand to be called they/them and sometimes switch between regular pronouns and gender neutral ones depending on how they're feeling about themselves.

At this point it's impossible to remember all these people's special pronouns, especially when they just look like regular men or women.

ctj3n9,ctj3n9,Latest news on Magdalen Berns,"Apologies if this has already been posted (I did check and couldn’t see that it had).

For those who aren’t active on Twitter, this is the latest from Magdalen’s account:

Hi all, this is Marion of @forwomenscot tweeting on behalf of Magdalen. Magdalen [- much to her frustration -] isn't able to type this herself, so she has asked us to update you on her health situation. 1/4

As many will be aware, Magdalen has been fighting glioblastoma (brain cancer) for the past year. Recent weeks have been tough: the doctors have done everything they can, but she's now moving to palliative care. 2/4

The progress of the tumour means that Magdalen is unable to see or reply to posts on social media, but if you DM or email ourselves at FWS, we will be happy to pass on any messages to her 3/4

Currently friends and family are working with Magdalen on a video with new footage. So watch this space! 4/4

bmrtmn,bmrtmn,My now EX- Trans partner. Update!,"I want to once again thank everyone for all their love and support. I can’t adequately put into words how much it’s meant to me. I was told such terrible things about this community, but all I’ve actually found are women who’ve put their politics aside to help a girl in trouble. You’re genuinely wonderful, compassionate people, and I’ll always be thankful and indebted to you all for that. I’m still working my way to replying to all the comments but I definitely will! 

Yesterday I told my best friend who I’m staying with, let’s call her Grace, absolutely everything and we had a cuddle and a cry. I held everything in for so long for a myriad of reasons, and coming out with the truth, not cloaked with any rhetoric, to someone who I know loves me and is on my side was so wonderful. 

Today I got my girls together, a good seven of us, and we went to my ex-partner’s apartment and cleared all my stuff out. My friend borrowed her mum’s Land Rover so everything nicely fit. 

The advice and support you all gave me was honestly priceless. I waited until they were at work, I’ve cut contact and I’ve called the bank to sort out separating our accounts. They’re actually quite rich, old money, trust fund- you know the type, so honestly I don’t think they’d bother taking anything from me. They work in canary wharf whilst I stupidly went into art as a career. But I thought better safe than sorry. Since I haven’t answered any of their messages or calls they’ve become insistent. I’ve changed their number to “do not answer,” as someone wonderfully recommended just in case I need evidence, but I don’t think I’ve got enough self control to stop myself from reading their messages so I might have to block them for my own sanity. One of them read “I’m sorry I was a bit rough the other day” and I stopped there. 

I know you all mentioned just the essentials, but I don’t want to see them for a very long time or send my friends there so I cleared *everything.* My clothes, my shoes, my make up, my bedsheets, my art, my books, my hoover, my picture frames, my pots and pans and mugs. Of course my cat. I don’t think they would, but the reply on the last post warning me that they might hurt her really frightened me and I didn’t want to leave her there for another second. I took absolutely everything. As I moved in, I didn’t bring much furniture and what I owned honestly looked tatty in comparison but I did take my rug and my dressing table which was easy enough to dismantle. My friends wanted to take everything from the fridge which made me laugh. I managed to stop them, but they did take all the expensive items. We had an evening of fancy from- France camembert and delicate, pretty looking pastries that I don’t know the names of. 

I know there were mixed responses about how I should break up, especially about leaving a letter, but the thought of seeing them in the flesh frightens me to no end so that ruled out anything face to face- public or not. I thought about what you all said about messaging them, but I ruled that out because I knew as soon as they read it I’d be in a shitstorm. I also thought about not saying anything, but I didn’t want to give them a reason to come and find me under the pretences of “we’re still in a relationship” or “why haven’t you come home or answered my hundreds of calls/texts.” And honestly, my heart saddened thinking of them sitting on that empty couch (I took all my fluffy pillows) in an apartment that now looks so barren, thinking about where I went and why. I *know* I don’t owe them anything, but it’s difficult to just stop caring for someone, even when they hurt you. I decided on a letter but I kept it as vague and full of cliches as possible so if worse came to worse, they wouldn’t hold it against me. 

It read: 

“I’m breaking up with you. I’m unhappy and we’ve grown apart. I appreciate the good times we had together but I need some change in my life. You don’t treat me as good as you used to and I don’t think that’s going to change, so I need to leave. Please don’t contact me in person or over the phone. If you do, I’ll call the police. (This is a white lie. I wouldn’t, but I’m hoping it’s enough of a threat) 
If you’re feeling unsafe, please call the Samaritan’s or a hospital. (I left them some numbers.) If you contact me with this information, I’m truly sorry and I wouldn’t want that, but I can’t be there for you and I’ll call your mother to see if she can help you instead. 

You broke my trust with what happened the other day. You know what I’m talking about. I did really, really love you, but now I need to leave.”

They know where my best friend lives, and I’m there now, but I love being around Grace. She’s truly an angel and my parents live too far away from work. I wouldn’t want to tell my mum anything either, it would just upset her and that’s the last thing I want. They know where all of my close friends live so it wouldn’t be much different. Should I give it a few days and see if it’s okay?

I don’t want to go to the police or a woman’s shelter. They’ve never hit me and I wouldn’t want to take up resources when I’m okay and I have places to go. The police sound like a nightmare. I don’t want to press charges, write statements, or have to prove anything, or god forbid go to court. I tried to call a women’s helpline but her voice was so soft and so full of pity that I couldn’t hack it. Maybe in a few months when I’ve had time to process I’ll try again, but for now I don’t think I can. It’s good though to know that in a crisis I have someone to talk to. 

I keep thinking about what happened between us before I left. I keep turning it over in my head obsessively until I feel sick but I can’t begin to think about it critically. You were so kind, caring and empathetic to me, thank you -especially taking away my “yes” from the weapons table if you will. I couldn’t really see it as assault because after that thing I was uncomfortable with they did make an effort to comfort me and ask if I was okay. I just don’t understand why someone who loves me would seek to hurt me in such a manipulative way. Whenever I doubt myself into thinking it didn’t happen the way I think it did or that maybe they misunderstood the signs, I read through your replies about trusting myself. I’m still so confused, angry, and saddened about the whole ordeal. 

But I’ve finally left which seems like a miracle. I’m with Grace, who I love and trust. I’ve got all my friends around me too. I don’t have to see my ex-partner until forever if that’s the way I want it. For the first time in a long time things are looking up.

You just mentioned an incident in vague language - yet they knew it was this particular occasion. This means they knew they were raping you when they did it. Sorry for the stark language, but it's just something to remember if ever you waver.\n\nI know the whole saga is so confusing, but the reason they chose to rape you is simply that they valued their own sexual pleasure over your desire to not have sex. It's that simple. They just didn't care about your feelings, because they are selfish. This is sadly very typical among those raised as men."", 'Glad to hear that you\'re safe, you got out ok and you got your things and your cat!\n\nGiven the situation it seems highly likely that this person will come over to Grace\'s house to ""chat"". They\'ll tell you that they only want to talk so that they can understand what happened. They\'ll even make promises like I\'ll stay on the porch and talk to you through the door. Don\'t fall for it. They do this then they cry or say/pretend they hurt themselves you go to look and that\'s when they start getting physical.\n\nIt\'s important to have a plan for when he comes over. Especially in different contexts (daytime versus nighttime, when your friend is home or not etc). I know this probably sounds over the top but being able to fall back on a plan means no matter what happens even if you freeze up you have something to go to.\n\nI\'d suggest they if he does turn up that your friend tell him (through the door) that he\'s unwelcome, that he is to leave and that if he doesn\'t you will call the police. Then do that. He is used to you caving because of him playing the trans card, you should show him that you\'re serious about using the resources at your disposal. I know that it\'s hard to call the police but they\'ll just get him to move on. Otherwise if he can\'t get you to come outside then he might start watching the house/yelling shit outside in the middle of the night (this is just my experience, I wish I went hard to begin with, it would have saved a lot of trouble).\n\nAlso it would be a good idea to talk to your parents about this if he has their phone numbers. It\'s highly likely that he will contact them and play the ""I don\'t know what\'s wrong with her, I love her so much, I\'m concerned about her blah blah"" card on them.

Yes, “in theory” you could prevent his assault on other people, but the horrible reality is that what will probably happen is your rape kit sitting around for ages, cops who treat you like the criminal instead of him, a judge who doesn’t see this as a crime even though it VERY clearly is or is otherwise totally unsympathetic, potentially even lawsuits for defamation against you (totally unsubstantiated but you said this guy has money so I can see this happening). I don’t mean to scare you but I want to paint a realistic picture of how this would go down. Obviously it’s good when rapists and abusers get justice, but you don’t have to sacrifice your own health and happiness for this. You need to do what is best for your life.\n\nOne last thing. If he does happen to come to where you are staying or begin physically stalking you, immediately call the police and file for an order of protection ASAP. Do not delay.

I can't give you any recommendations as I'm in a completely different country. An alternative is to read some good books for survivors of abuse. From what I know about your story, I would definitely recommend something focused on *narcissistic* abuse in romantic relationship.

After breaking up with my violent ex-bf, therapy was extremely helpful to start loving and trusting myself again. Also it’s an extremely safe place to talk about things that make us feel a little bit uncomfortable or things that we don’t want to talk with friends, no because lack of trust, just because you don’t want to. You are going to need support through this process. And telling your family about this is going to hurt them, yes, because they want the best for you, BUT if you *need* to talk to your mom and have her support, do it.

(2) It\'s a doctor\'s diagnosis of gender dysphoria, you wouldn\'t call justifying and *necessary* documents for an [insanity defence] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense#Scottish_law) in a court of law intrusive—and we are very much in the legal domain here. If trans- activists are going to espouse that transition in all its forms is a necessary treatment for a mental illness (gender dysphoria), then there needs to be substantiating documentation of the mental illness, simple as that. (3) The only trouble I can see is if you have to show your ID and there\'s a disjoint between your social ""pronouns"" and your legal gender. But realistically speaking, given how liberal Scotland is right now, are you really going to face much discrimination with that? Further, most trans- persons take years before they fully ""pass""; most everyone you interact with is going to know you\'re trans- even if you don\'t bring up legal certification. And if it\'s an issue of them getting triggered by seeing their birth sex, then I think the legal documentation is the least of their worries (are they going to freak out every time they need to see the doctor for a sex-specific issue? how about when strangers misgender them, deliberately or no? or if they see baby photos of themselves?), especially when there\'s a guaranteed payoff after a two year wait.\n\nOnerous? As it damn well should be. (1) Transitioning is a major life decision. Even people who are considering getting married, getting tattoos, immigrating to a new country etc. have waited two, ten, twenty years and longer (or at least strongly advised to do so). That this is a matter of legal mandate rather than general advice is a matter of protecting females AND unsure trans- persons as vulnerable classes. (2) They\'ll only be undermining their own cause if they do this; how are they going to deny the existence of transtrenders/male rapists exploiting this to get closer to women if they literally give them a free pass *to change their gender and back, and all in a weekend*?\n\n> Engender received an income last year of £335,000, of which £301,000 came from the Scottish government.

cy3e9f,cy3e9f,"The ultimate weapon against male trolling, ""teasing"" and other bullshit","I had an epiphany recently. 

A couple weeks ago I did a favour for a family friend by babysitting their twelve-year-old-child, as it was an emergency. I can already tell this kid is gonna become an incel. He spent the evening entertaining himself by saying racist and sexist comments to me and getting a kick out of my annoyed reaction. As I rolled my eyes at his shit-eating grin after a particularly absurd and offensive remark, I noticed the look of eager anticipation in his eyes and suddenly it dawned on me: **men are not deterred by or afraid of female anger.** It's quite the opposite actually, they seem to derive pleasure from it.

I remembered all the times my father would ""tease"" me and my sister until we cried, and how he would gleefully continue because he thought it was ""funny"" even after my mom yelled at him to stop.

I recalled all the boyfriends that habitually and intentionally provoked me, and the look of amusement they got from my annoyed or angry reaction, because they say it's ""cute"" when I'm mad.

I thought of all the posts I see on reddit from women complaining that their boyfriend/husband keeps doing the thing they repeatedly told him not to do, even after she explicitly communicates why that behavior angers/annoys/upsets her.

It reminded me of the saying ""women fear that men will kill them, whereas men fear that women will laugh at them."" Men do not fear female anger the same way that women fear male anger; in fact, men enjoy it, and are therefore incentivized to continue provoking us. Although women may feel humiliated,  frustrated, or silenced when men laugh at them, we do not *fear* it the same way that men do.

Therefore, it logically follows that the most powerful weapon a woman can wield against a man is... laughter. Not laughing *with* him, I don't want to give him the validation. It's important to laugh *at* him in order to maximize the damage to his fragile male ego.

So I decided to conduct an experiment. Instead of getting angry at that twelve-year-old, I laughed at him. Every stupid comment he flung at me, I just smiled smugly, shook my head, and laughed condescendingly. And holy shit was he ever triggered. I almost felt bad that me, an adult woman, was mocking a twelve-year-old child. Then I remembered that I was teaching him the important lesson that those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Since then I've started using the same technique with my current boyfriend. On occasion he says something insensitive or annoying, and when I get mad, he says ""I WaS jUsT tEaSiNg, CaNt yOu TaKe A jOkE"". When he made a rude comment the other day, I didn't hesitate to hit below the belt: ""wow, it's like you're literally unaware that you're nowhere near as clever as you think you are!"" and cackled maniacally. Since he's insecure about his intelligence, he was extremely offended. It actually opened up a much-needed conversation: ""so when you say something mean, it's okay because it's a 'joke' but when I say something mean, it's not okay because it hurt your feelings? Do you remember all the times I told you when your 'jokes' hurt my feelings too?"" It's like he literally couldn't comprehend it until I put it that way.

Other times I've used this technique is when he's convinced he's right when he's factually, objectively wrong about something I'm an expert in and which he knows nothing about: ""Sorry! My bad! I forgot that you have the penis, which magically makes you right! Even when you are wrong!"" ""No it's just that-"" ""ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY FLESH ROD"" ""...why are you-"" (shouting directly at his crotch) ""OMNISCIENT PENIS-HAVER, PLEASE FORGIVE MY HUBRIS"" ""what-"" ""OH TINY LUMP OF TISSUE, ALL-POWERFUL, AND ALL-KNOWING!!"" ""..."" (confused silence)

To conclude, I'm not really sure how this relates to the trans rights movement, just wanted to share a funny and enlightening discovery I made recently. Although it sucks to have to hide my anger, even when it's 100% justified, I find that getting mad at a man just makes him want to do that thing over and over and over until it grinds me down. It feels sooo fucking good to throw their bullshit right back at them and laugh in their face. Female laughter is, apparently, the most terrifying thing that could possibly happen to a man.

Please note: I do not advise using this technique if you are in an unsafe situation. I'm sure some men would lash out and use violence to silence female laughter. Only do this if you feel safe and comfortable doing so.",564,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

She focused on the example of exhibitionistic men, and argued that our reaction of fear to men indecently exposing themselves to us is actually something that grants *more* power to the male fallos. Men exposing themselves to women do so because they want to use their power to influence us, especially scare us or make us feel like victims. She argues that the only way to battle the power that men have through their penises, is to stop reacting with fear and filing police reports, and instead react with the much more reasonable *laughing at their ridiculous penises.* She furthermore argues that the male genitals are, in themselves, the least threatening part of the male body, as they are vulnerably and sensitive.\n\nI think this goes for many things.

In fact, the angrier his target got, the more amused he was.

agq6pk,agq6pk,"""Not all women have a uterus""","Long-time anonymous lurker here, decided to make an account.  I'm recently Peak Trans and read all the resources on the sidebar and I feel like Gender Critical feminism makes the most sense to me.

I want to tell you something.

I was born a female.  I had horrendous issues with my female parts in my 20's.  My ovaries ballooned up with painful cysts that would send me to the emergency room, bent over in tears.  My periods were unpredictable, ranging from downpours to absent, and never on any regular schedule.  Getting put on birth control pills mitigated both of those problems, but of course insurance didn't cover them all those years ago so I paid out of pocket.

My mother died in her early 50's.  Cancer.  Her father died of cancer even younger.  When I began to research that side of the family, it was everywhere... almost everyone genetically related to me through my mother died of cancer.

I paid out of pocket for genetic testing.  It was a couple thousand dollars.  But it revealed to me what I feared: I had the BRCA1 genetic mutation.  My mother almost certainly had it.  My mutation was associated with particularly malignant ovarian cancers.

On one fine day, I let a surgeon open my body and take my ovaries.  He took my uterus and cervix, too.  This was so I could be put on pure estrogen HRT.  Estrogen plus progesterone can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, which is bad when you're already BRCA1 positive, but without progesterone I was told the lining of my uterus would thicken uncontrollably from the estrogen and place me at an increased risk of endometrial cancer.  For the best chance of survival, it all had to go.

Then, once I had healed from that violation, I let a team of two surgeons open my body again.  One surgeon cut out all the tissue from both breasts.  The other surgeon filled the empty spaces with implants and stitched me shut.  The thing about implants after a mastectomy is that there's no breast tissue left to hide the weird way the silicone wants to ripple.  For the best cosmetic result, the implants are shoved into a pocket that is opened up under your pectoral muscles.  Does that sound like it hurts a lot?  Because it does.  I could scarcely roll over or sit up without help for a week.  I had four drains in my chest for two weeks.  Some of my remaining skin lost its blood supply and died, requiring a second surgery to remove it.  It was two months before I could raise my arms above my head again.  The implants move when my pectoral muscles do.  It looks strange and unnatural.

These are the things we do to survive.  I now have zero genuine female parts... just scars where they used to exist.  I remember what I told the surgeon right before they sedated me.  I told him that if he couldn't reconstruct me right then, to leave my chest flat.  I wasn't willing to go through two more surgeries just to have fake breasts.

Yet I am a woman.  When the women around me worry about their access to birth control, I don't shout at them that ""NOT EVERY WOMAN CAN GIVE BIRTH!""  When women complain about the tampon tax, I don't pitch a fit because I don't have a uterus.  I don't have breasts any more, but I care about breast cancer and mammograms and genetic testing.  I care about these things because I am a woman and I have empathy for those distinct, biological concerns that women have.

I guess what I'm saying is: don't let anyone tell you that it's not okay to talk about your female parts.  Those of us who had them, and lost them, still stand in solidarity with you.  The people trying to silence you aren't doing it for the comfort of people like me.  They're doing it for the comfort of people who were never women, who never shared the concerns of women, and who are taking up disproportionate space in feminism.

cpnucc,cpnucc,Yes. Intersex people exist. We know.,"Intersex people are people with any combination of physical, hormonal, or genetic/chromosomal aberrations which make it difficult or impossible to determine their sex. They may be physically somewhere in between male and female, and they often have ambiguous genitalia and have invasive surgery forced on them as children, meaning many of them are literally assigned a gender at birth.

You, on the other hand, are a man. Physically and genetically, there is little to no difference between you and any other healthy, fully functional male. You were not ""assigned"" male. You were *observed* to be male. There was nothing unusual about your body until you decided to fuck with it. Maybe you have a mental problem, maybe you have a fetish, maybe you've been taken advantage of by ""communities"" of older men, whatever. None of that is in the same *ballpark* as an intersex condition, which is quantifiable and real.

Which means they are the only ones with the right to use ""assigned at birth"".', 'Sorry this post is very wrong. \n\nAccording to the [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20739&LangID=E,) \'intersex\' refers to \'people with physical or biological sex characteristics that do not ﬁt the typical deﬁnitions for male or female bodies\'.\n\nI believe that this is the definition used by the \'LGBTI\' types. I.e. they are encompassing EVERYONE who has non-typical sexual characteristics.\n\nThis may encompass as much as 2% of the population.\n\nHOWEVER, only a tiny number of these people are \' difficult or impossible to determine their sex\'. In fact, nearly all people with \'intersex\' (although the term DSD should be preferred) conditions have a condition that is unambiguously of one specific biological sex.\n\nFor example MRKH syndrome refers to women who have underdeveloped (or even absent) uteruses or vaginas. However there is no doubt they are women - they lack testes, they possess ovaries, and they have normal female secondary sexual characteristics. \n\nIt is important to understand the games being played here, in terms of numbers, advocacy, and so on.\n\nFirstly the number being cited is around 1.7% for \'intersex\'. However nearly all such individuals have late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is CAH manifesting itself AFTER infancy (hence in a child who was entirely unambiguously male or female at birth). *Classic* congenital adrenal hyperplasia is screened for in ALL infants in the US and 40 other countries, but unlike the late-onset variety is very rare - it is around 0.1%, and once diagnosed, you simply raise the child according to their gonads (i.e. if they have ovaries you raise them as girls, if they have testes you raise them as boys).\n\nThis was despite the attempts of Dr. John Money, the paedophile who invented gender ideology and transgenderism, to argue that gender was arbitrary, and essentially that baby girls born with large clitorises could be assigned male.\n\nSimilarly we know that there are other conditions where, if diagnosed, we can state quite confidently the correct sex of the baby.\n\nFor example, Caster Semenya is known (as per court depositions) to have 5-alpha reductase deficiency. This is a condition where male babies lack dihydrotestosterone, and fail to form normal genitals.\n\nHowever they possess normal functioning testes inside their bodies, and at puberty will develop into men, and can father children. Studies of babies with 5ARD show that those raised as males remain males, while most of those raised female change to male after puberty (aside: it is possible that some of those that remained female were castrated, which would cement the female identity - the literature is not clear on this) when testosterone virilises their body. As such, a baby with 5ARD is a boy, even if his genitals may appear female.\n\nThe number of people who undergo DSD-related surgery is only 0.1% and the number requiring \'sex assignment at birth\' by a professional is only 0.05% (and even this number does not imply that the assignment is arbitrary)\n\nIt is quite misleading in most cases to describe someone as \'somewhere in between male and female\', in that a girl with an enlarged clitoris is no more \'in between male and female\' than a girl who is poisoned with testosterone later in life as part of \'gender reassignment\'. Rather, she has atypical *female* biology. A woman having a big clitoris, or a beard is not a man. The terms \'under-virilised\' (for boys) \'virilised\' (for girls), or \'ambiguous genitalia\' should be preferred.\n\nAlthough the \'LGBTI\' types will claim the 1.7% figure, the reality is ""if the term intersex is to retain any meaning, the term should be restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female. Applying this more precise definition, the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about 0.018%""\n\nFrom my perspective, someone whose chromosomal sex differs from their phenotypic sex does not necessarily suffer an ambiguity.\n\nFor example, a woman with Swyer syndrome (46,XY), is born with a normal female phenotype, as one of several Y-chromosome-linked genes is non-functional meaning that gonads are not distinguished into testes as they would normally be in XY babies, and hence there are no hormones (from the testes) to stimulate the production of male genitals, and in the absence of those male hormones, the Mullerian ducts develop into a full set of female plumbing (vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes).\n\nSince a person with Swyer syndrome possesses female genitals, and lacks both male AND female gonads, we administer oestrogen & progesterone to promote the development of female characteristics. (Pregnancy is possible using donated eggs.)\n\nOn the other hand, a man with XX chromosomes caused by the transposition of the sex-determining Y gene from the father\'s Y chromosome to the father\'s X chromosome will have male genitals (including testes), but will be somewhat under-virilised.\n\nHowever there isn\'t really any confusion that such individuals are male - their XX chromosomes will likely not be diagnosed until later, when their infertility is determined (along possibly with other issues associated with low testosterone in men such as libido)\n\nThe condition of androgen insensitivity is one of XY individuals (it\'s irrelevant to XX individuals), as testosterone is either not at all, or poorly, processed by the XY body. If the body is completely immune to testosterone, then an XY individual with testes will develop a wholly female phenotype and again it isn\'t really reasonable to describe them as male despite the fact they may have testes.\n\nMost androgen insensitivity is only partial, which can mean that you DO get something \'in between\', if you will, in that depending on the severity of insensitivity, you can be unambiguously male, unambiguously female, or \'hmm\'. \n\nAs far as gender assignment goes with true hermaphroditism (when you have both ovarian AND testicular tissue, but never, ever, ever both functioning), then most such individuals are infertile so there isn\'t an argument from the perspective of fertility, so this is a case where gender surgery, may be attractive for doctors/parents, but yet may also be unnecessary and/or premature (and this has been litigated in the US).\n\nHowever between:\n\n1) the great majority of cases of DSDs where it is simply a variance to a male or female phenotype, with no question of being a different sex to the chromosomal\n\n2) the conditions where there is a difference between phenotype and chromosomes, but the condition is still unambiguous in terms of the \'gender\' (such as XX SRY+, which is always male, or XY SRY-, which is always female)\n\n3) the conditions where we now know, unambiguously, the correct gender assignment (such as 5ARD being male), despite efforts by the likes of Dr Money to insist it is an arbitrary assignment based on the environment/socialization\n\nit is clear that in fact the incidence of intersex (as in \'true intersex\') people is firstly extremely rare (but grossly inflated for lobbying purposes by hungry special interest groups), and also the number of cases where the \'sex assigned at birth\' is even CLOSE to ambiguous is even smaller.\n\nOf course the basic point is that \'I\' is strictly biological and has no place with sexual preferences (LGB) or fetishes/mental disorders (T).\n\nBut we must first understand that the true \'I\' is a tiny group made 1000x bigger by the likes of the UN because, well, otherwise what would all these lobbyists DO with themselves?\n\nps. it might be that many people with intersex conditions are infertile. Maybe most, if you first exclude CAH (which is most of the supposed 2%), however being an infertile woman doesn\'t make you \'not a woman\', so the \'I\' could just as well be \'infertile\' in that infertility is a distressing condition for many. why not LGBTII if you want a dumb alphabet soup acronym to blind people with your bullshit?', ""If trans folks stop appropriating the struggle or the condition of others, they wouldn't be trans. \n\nThere's no real medical condition for transgender.

It's not real, not a permanent change, it's a temporary alteration which needs to be constantly reinforced to maintain the illusion.  They freak out so badly when someone interferes with their need to maintain the illusion.

Not a one of them, not a single one, actually believes they can change sex.  If they did, they wouldn't need all the outside validation.  I've seen women and men 'misgendered' a few times.  Happens in retail when you are frazzled or hear someone's voice and associate it with the wrong gender and I have never, ever seen one of them get upset about it.  Me included.

Why?  Because we don't need everyone else's affirmation of our identities so our connection to reality isn't affected if someone makes an incorrect assumption.  Our sense of self isn't threatened by someone else not acknowledging it, because it's not dependent on that.   Our lives aren't built on illusions that need to be maintained by everyone around us to keep from crumbling because that is called mental illness.

col3ug,col3ug,I help run a daily children's club and one of our girls identifies as he/him. She's 9.,"I just need to rant because this is such a horrible way to raise a child. 

So this girl, I'll call her B, has this woman (identifies as non-binary) drop her off every day and she always calls them by their first name. So after a few weeks I asked her, ""is _____ your sibling? How're you related?"" And she said ""____ is my parent!"".  

And I just stood there dumbfounded that this woman was projecting this mental illness onto their daughter. So B calls their own mom by her first name because this woman can't handle being called mom. Whatever. That's not even the worst of it. 

So another day I ask B what she's doing this weekend, and she says ""well I'm going to visit my one parent in _____, and my other parent is going to drop me off there, and I'm going to spend time with both my parents"" 

So I realized, BOTH her parents identify as non-binary. What the fuck? Every conversation with her is so vague and confusing because everything is non-gendered and I just don't get it. 

My coworker referred to B as a girl and she corrected her and said, ""it's a common misunderstanding but I actually identify as he/him. But dont feel bad. This happens a lot and I just want you to know for the future""  

Where have we gotten as a society where a fucking 9-year-old girl can't just simply wear a Minecraft shirt and cut her hair short and just be that, a girl with short hair.

bo5sw5,bo5sw5,Pornography is sexualizing stepfamilies and slowly normalizing incest.,"This is a crosspost from somewhere else but I added some thoughts into it afterwards. 

""In the last 5 years or so, I've noticed a massive influx of incest scenarios on Pornhub and other free-to-use tube sites. These insanely popular videos (some in the tens of millions of views) sexualize familial relationships, with the highest quality production going into depicting sexual acts between ""step"" mothers and sons, ""step"" fathers and daughters, step-siblings, etc. We have a number of videos in which actors are role-playing teenagers in high school. The actors are made to look as young as possible, and the situations attempt to capture a ""regular household"" in which a kid might have a step-brother or a step-father who is actively pursing a sexual relationship with them. In some videos, step-mothers are encouraging step-daughters to have sex with their sons, or husbands, and vice-versa.
We all have an awareness of these videos existing, because in the US they normally trend at the top of the most popular or most-viewed. Advertisements featuring incredibly young looking girls are now almost routine, and the highest quality pornography (which people naturally gravitate towards due to image resolution, or big-name stars) are featuring these incest fantasies. As an example, there's a video on Pornhub in which a teen climbs into her parents bed because she's scared, and her ""step-father"" has sex with her next to her sleeping mother. It's totally insane. That video has millions and millions of views. I feel as though no one can talk about it, no one can acknowledge it, and no one can do anything about it because sex and pornography is a taboo subject in the US, and most people are just fine without discussing what they privately enjoy. However, the faux-incest productions are slowly becoming a pervasive, unavoidable element to online pornography, and I cannot help but think there are consequences to depicting so much fake incest.
A lot of people are going to say this is fantasy, and harmless. I think that's a really good argument, and I would never be behind laws that prohibit the freedom to produce any kind of porn featuring consenting adults. However, I also think of the accessibility of pornography nowadays, and how many kids are online watching these videos and being exposed to a ton of incest scenarios. It's got to have some kind of effect, right? is it affecting adults? Is porn so divorced from reality that we can compartmentalize it and avoid any kind of behavioral influence? Is porn trying to mimic our everyday reality to appear more attractive and ""realistic""?""

Whats horrifying is that the comments were mostly ""nobody watches porn for the story"" and ""Its not that serious"" or ""let people have their fetishes""

I see this argument raised all the time, but folks don't account for how memories are physiologically formed at the neuronal level. You still ingest the titles, couple it with pleasure, and BAM! neuronal connection of incest/dopamine is created. Do this over and over and over at a population wide level and you have now moved the population towards normalized incest. I acknowledge that I might be wrong, I am not a neurologist, but that is definitely the theory that I am working with, and I would chance a bet that it is more valid than ""I don't watch porno for the stories"".
Also, if folks aren't watching it for the incest part, WHY IS THE GENRE EXPLODING? Have you seen the increase in posts about incest being ok in general on reddit too?

The porn companies are similar to tobacco companies. They want consumers hooked young to become lifelong users. Porn is like any other stimulus: as people get desensitized they are going to ""need"" more extreme content to generate a response. Read some testimonials or reddit threads from porn addicts. People talk about how content that once disgusted them seems like nothing. Especially when porn hit the internet and there was an explosion in content, producers need more shocking content to ""stand out"". \n\nI think a lot of it has to do with an obsession with pushing boundaries. People rationalize it by saying it\'s ok because it\'s not ""real"" incest.', 'Step-families are the current trend but who here feels comfortable being a ""babysitter"" anymore? Obviously for friends and family, but remember the time teenage/college girls could just babysit for their neighbors or parents friend, etc without worrying the dad is going to sexualize them? Or new mothers could hire that teenage babysitter or nanny without worrying the husband is going to groom them while you\'re in work/recovering? Or being alone with your male professor? School uniforms? All gone. Porn has sexualized so many situations and social interactions that really shouldn\'t be and now everyone is on edge when they have to deal with them.', 'It\'s revolting and I think a LOT more women would be anti-porn if they knew exactly what the trending videos were like. \n\nI started getting into radical feminism after watching a Gail Dines lecture about pornography. Up until that point I naively thought the type of porn on websites like Pornhub were ""normal"" things. PIV sex with cheesy storylines (e.g. pizza delivery guy and horny girl alone at home), girls stripping, girl-on-girl, maybe the odd FMF threesome or anal scene. I watched this porn lecture and thought to myself ""maybe they are exaggerating"".\n\nSo I went on Pornhub to see that was being recommended to people going on the website for the first time. Even after hearing about the kinds of categories on there I was shocked, especially after seeing how many incest videos were being recommended. I know I saw the stepdad-stepdaughter video you mentioned being recommended to me. The experience left me a bit traumatized and I\'ve definitely been much more critical towards the sex industry (and men in general!) since then.

I'd last looked at a porn site a few years ago, and was horrified by the violence I saw, and only recently visited pornhub again after seeing a post here about the step daughter/sister/mother trope, and sure enough, that garbage was all over the fucking place.\n\nMy guess is that the overly violent content wasn't sustainably appealing enough, and now they're pushing incest. It's so disgusting, and makes me concerned for women and girls everywhere. People are deluding themselves of they think watching porn where an actor pretends to rape his pubescent looking step daughter has no real life implications."", ""I think this is absolutely right.\n\nWe are running the experiment of seeing what will happen when we combine porn websites, algorithms and free reign of our most perverted instincts.\n\nI think the analysis you give is right. We are normalizing it, just as we have normalized lots of other things with porn already, like anal and cumshots.\n\nWe have a society-wide situation where most people watch porn, and get trapped in the addiction. Surely a lot of people currently must get sort of disgusted by themselves nowadays, knowing that it is wrong, but being unable to stop.\n\nI think we need to kill some of our most cherished clichès for this. Every fetish is not okay. Some expressions of sexuality are better or worse than others. Like there is healthy patterns of other drives, like eating. Eating a normal diet is good, but drooling over pictures of food is unhealthy. Similarly, watching pornography is unhealthy. And watching grotesque incest pornography is severely unhealthy. And that's just for each person, not to mention the awful consequences for society when these monstrosities are setting new norms, and the opportunities for making money in porn grows ever more tempting.\n\nThere is also this feedback loop where we are serving our perverted desires for the dopamine rush, and so we go the hedonic treadmill to require more and more of it. And at the same time that part of our brain becomes larger and larger, as we give it more and more energy to form more and stronger pathways. It becomes harder and harder to stop the further it goes on.\n\nIt's like we have to stop, but I have no idea how. I almost can't see it. For me I tried and failed to stop for years, until I eventually succeeded with a full stop. And I think I am a fairly high in self-control. I just can't see it happening society-wide.

Then when he tries to have “normal” sex with his partner his penis doesn’t get hard or won’t stay hard because he becomes accustomed to watching porn. I remember one guy on reddit that said he had to masturbate on the toilet because it was the only place he could be alone to do it, he said it was weird at first but got used to it until one day he was home alone and wanted to masturbate in his own bed, he couldn’t do it and thought it was weird so he tested the theory and went back to the toilet and wallah. He had no problem masturbating on the toilet. He luckily caught this and refused to jack off on the toilet anymore to reverse the problem which worked. Seriously, a young GIRL OR BOY, getting on porn sites, seeing this, watching this, repeatedly, masturbating to it, you do connect that “title thought” with pleasure.

There was always a sense that such content was only for a certain audience, so it was well-hidden.\n\nThis is not the case today. Pornography is like any drug; over time, the user develops a tolerance and seeks more exciting and intense experiences. It is not by design that more incest and rape content is popular; the medium is the message. First we had infinite access to porn.

[This is the imagery](https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/san-francisco-public-library-hosts-transgender-art-exhibit-featuring-weapons-intended-to-kill-feminists/) we are often subjected to. \n\nTransgender activists argue that identification as a woman is a more meaningful form of social categorization/affiliation than sex, and argue that spaces that are segregated by sex should be segregated by gender identity instead, including prisons, sports teams, shelters, and shower rooms.\n\nThis argument is underpinned by and declares some harmful and sexist ideological positions, specifically:\n\n* Segregated spaces exist because men and women have different brains\n* Male violence against women is caused by brain sex, not socialization (ergo, males raised as men but who identify as female are as safe to women as “other” women)\n* Members of the female sex have an innate gender identity of “woman”\n* Oppression on the basis of sex is not a meaningful ground on which to politically organize\n* Feeling like one is a woman is equivalent to being a woman\n\nIt’s on this last point where the screenshot in this thread comes into play.\n\nGenderists claim that male people who identify as women are authentically women; they know what it is like to be women, understand women’s life experiences, experience misogyny like we do, and think and act like we do.\n\nWe don’t experience misogyny for identifying as women. The construct of ""woman"" is the method by which sex-based power dynamics and roles are distributed. Christine Blasey Ford wasn’t raped because she identified as a woman. Kavanaugh isn’t planning to decimate women’s reproductive choices because of their brain sex. The oppression of women is fundamentally rooted in social designations and roles centered around the material characteristics of their sexed bodies.\n\nI received a comment yesterday saying that “womanhood can be appropriated” (their words) because women make up half the population. Males can see how their female peers act and are treated, therefore, males can understand what it’s like to be female.\n\nBut when you compare the topics of conversation about women and male people who identify as women, what we spend the most of our time actually thinking, talking, and worrying about, the falsehood of that statement becomes explicitly evident.\n\nThreads about the Kavanaugh hearing in r/TwoX weren’t as much a matter of political concern as they were social concern. It isn\'t about republicans versus democrats. It\'s about the despair of witnessing a powerful government seriously consider a misogynistic rapist for one of the most powerful positions in the country.\n\n[The personal is political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political).\n\nWomen are posting about this in mass numbers because it evokes feelings of desolation, disgust, hopelessness, and fear.

besp6f,besp6f,I am an Ex Muslim woman and this sub is like finally coming home to sanity and fresh air - thank you!,"[NOTE - Apologies, this is very long as I ended up pouring years worth of thoughts/experiences into it! TL/DR at the end]

Hello! 

I have been lurking on this subreddit for many months now, and finally decided to create a Reddit account and subscribe. I feel I have so much to say, most of which I cannot express in either Ex Muslim or liberal feminist places (and certainly not in my 'own' community i.e the South Asian/Muslim community). But this community seems like it is full of women who may actually *get* it, and finding radical feminism has been a revelation for me - so here goes. I hope this is the appropriate place to share some of my experiences, please let me know if it is not!  

**Part One: Being raised a girl in a patriarchal Muslim family (hint: nobody checked my 'gender identity' before deciding my place, worth or rights in life).**


I was raised in a traditional Sunni Muslim household.  Growing up as a girl and then a woman in this religion suffocated me every day. Whatever many Muslims and the so-called liberal left would like to say, my community were not 'extreme' in the sense that their interpretation of Islam was not some crazy, evil, radical interpretation, nor were they random evil people influenced only by their 'culture' as distinct from their religious beliefs. No, our family life was an entirely normal, traditional interpretation of Islam based on standard understandings of the main scriptures and teachings (Quran, Hadith & commentary). 

I went to mosque five times a week, where I was taught that my body should be covered to a much higher degree than my male siblings; that my inheritance and testimony was worth half that of a male's even though I shouldered the financial burden at home (being the only one with a decent job); that if I refused my husband sex, the angels would curse me all night; that my husband could marry four wives PLUS what was then taught to me as 'that which his right hand possesses', but what I now, frankly, call 'concubines' or 'sex slaves'; that my husband could 'beat' me if I disobeyed him, but that was OK because according to some scholars he could 'only' do it with a 'light tap' or that he could 'only' do it as a last resort after he had first tried to separate our beds, then not speaking to me, as though I was a child to be admonished into obedience - and on and on it goes. Please note that my intention is not to start any religious debates about the exact literal meaning of these verses, etc, but just to try to explain how demeaned I felt growing up as a young woman in Islam. 

I felt suffocated not only by the clothes I had been commanded by God to wear (as I believed at the time), but also by the entire ideology itself and what that said about my place in the world. 'Hijab' is not just a piece of fabric around one's hair - it separates you from your fellow males and teaches you that something about YOUR hair and body as opposed to theirs is inherently lustful, sinful, to be viewed only by the man you end up marrying (and some other close family members); it mandates that you do not show the shape of your body; it dictates that when you walk, you wear no 'noisy' jewellery or perfume so as not to attract male attention - it is just one part of an entire system of modesty which disproportionately burdens women. 

I tried so hard to really believe all of this was 'empowering' in some way, that it meant I had escaped the beauty standards and objectification of women in society - but how could I ever really believe that, when hijab is sexualised just as much as anything else by many men. I have been proposed to and hit on in the lewdest ways by men whilst dressed head to toe in black, with my hair covered. I never deep down believed this was an empowering system, I could never really grasp it. I tried to read the Quran to educate myself and find justification for what seemed like inherent unfairness to women, but everything I read just made me more and more disgusted. 

No wonder, then,  that I despised being a woman. I hated it. I did not want this life, I remember telling my father from a young age that I wish I had been born a boy, that I wanted *their* modesty obligations (basically just cover from the navel to the knees) and just enjoy basic freedoms like playing outside in the sunshine without worrying about exposing my elbows or a strand of hair (sidenote, when everything is covered, men will fetishize literally anything - elbows, strands of hair, a quick flash of ankle, that is all it takes. Hijab never made me feel protected). But I could not 'identify' my way out of my place in life. Nobody asked me what my gender identity was before they decided my rights in marriage, my inheritance rights, the modesty doctrine I was to follow. My entire self worth was decided the moment that I was born and my parents saw I had a vagina, rather than a penis. This was to dictate the rest of my life, and become even more of a burden once puberty hit and my breasts developed and I suddenly became a walking sin to be covered up.  This is why the idea that a man can just 'identify' into womanhood and then demand I do not 'centre' my feminism around my vagina/genitals/reproductive system is so offensive to me. My vagina and female body has been the reason for my oppression and second class status my whole life, I can no sooner de-centre it from my life than I can turn into a unicorn. 

**Part Two: Becoming an Ex Muslim and finding liberal feminism**

To cut a long story short, after years of struggling with my faith I eventually ended up leaving Islam and becoming an atheist. I could not tolerate it anymore. I did not want to get married to a man and sign up to a religious marriage which I felt was a deeply demeaning institution for women. 

After many years, I found some other ex Muslim women (and men) in a local community. But I felt out of step with many of them too, as the feminism in these communities (in my experience) tends to be a very liberal 'sex positive' kind of feminism - in a panel on feminism and Islam, one of the women called herself a sex positive feminist when asked about the sex trade. I was uncomfortable with this, but never found the language to express why I could not get on board if porn/prostitution was 'personal choice.' It felt strange to me that as Ex Muslim women, we were able to see the inherent problems with claiming the hijab is a free, empowering, feminist choice. Many Ex Muslim women spoke of how this sort of 'choice' feminist defence of the hijab was only really relevant for relatively few privileged Western women, whilst many of our sisters across the globe were forced into it. They acknowledged that even amongst ourselves in our very liberal world, we had often tried to convince ourselves we felt 'empowered' by or 'chose' the hijab when oftentimes the very idea that it was 'commanded by God' or expected by the community created a lot of pressure to wear it to be seen as 'pure' or 'worthy'. And yet these same women did not seem to apply the same kind of critique of 'choice' feminism to things like the sex trade, prostitution, etc. I would be curious to know if any other Ex Muslim/ex religious women felt like this? 

Also, in the Ex Muslim groups I saw very young, vulnerable women who had just been kicked out of their homes in polyamorous relationships with older men. Again, this made me uncomfortable - these men were also the same people helping  to support the woman in question financially and the women never seemed as happy about the polyamory as the men did. Maybe this is just my perception, but I have personally spoken to at least a few of the women who confessed they really wanted an exclusive relationship with the man in question. Also many women expressed feeling 'preyed upon' in private by some of the ex Muslim men who joined just to find women to sleep with. There was also a lot of pressure to sleep around and I was not into any of that. I got the feeling that having left a very restrictive religion, Ex Muslim men and women placed a very high value on personal freedom and choice, especially when it came to sexual partners, perhaps for entirely understandable reasons. But it did result in a sort of converse pressure to sleep around, be cool and free - I wanted to reject Islam but not then be pressured to sleep around to prove how free and liberal I was. 

Why does this matter? Because when I first moved out of my family's home many years ago, I was alone and had no family. I was lost, confused, penniless. After some months of this, I met a much older man and ended up for a while sleeping on his sofa - until he wanted more. I had my first sexual experiences with this man.  When the person you are sleeping with is the only thing keeping a roof over your head, choice became difficult, blurry. Luckily I realised very quickly that I was very, very uncomfortable and found the resources to do something about it, but not before I experienced sexual assault at a very vulnerable stage in my life. Nobody in the world should be pressured or forced - whether by force or financial circumstance to sell use of their bodies/sex. I still struggle to understand why my experience of Ex Muslim communities is that they do not often acknowledge this, and treat these decisions as empowering/liberal choices. 

I also struggle to understand why many are so quick to dismiss women who want female only spaces and have legitimate concerns about men in our spaces, particularly in rape centres, changing rooms etc. Given that so many of us were oppressed by men because of our female bodies, I would have expected more support. It has been heart breaking to find the opposite.  

**Part Three: Finding radical feminism and this sub**

I had been mulling over the above issues for many years, slowly feeling like I was going crazy. I was so incredibly glad when I found this sub reddit! Thank you all so much, I have never commented before but really found a lot of strength with the unapologetic women-centred support I see in this subreddit. When people call this place hateful, I wonder if they ever think of all the people you lift up and strengthen. I know many Ex Muslim women feel betrayed by liberal feminism, but so far radical feminists have unapologetically refused to sell us out for fear of criticising Islam. 

It was a great older teacher and mentor of mine who introduced me to radical feminism. She is an amazing retired lesbian rad fem who has really supported me over the years. She challenged my thinking when I was Muslim and never stopped criticising the hijab, religious marriage, etc. I owe so much of my life and freedom to her - so I would like to say to all you older radfem women, we younger women need you. Thank you to each and every one of you! 

TL;DR - Hated being a woman in Islam; found liberal feminism as an Ex Muslim woman but did not relate to the 'sex positive' liberal feminism I found; found radical feminism and it is awesome!",548,"['Your story and strength are so inspiring. My peak libfem period was catalyzed by seeing so-called “feminists” presenting hijab as an empowering choice. I just couldn’t understand how anyone calling themselves a feminist could support such things.\n\nI was raised in a cult-like Christian household, definitely not as oppressive as your environment, but still a long journey out... anyway, always remember you’re not alone.', 'I\'m so touched by this, and I feel so sorry for all that you have had to endure. I\'m a Pakistani American but grew up in Pakistan. I remember when my own grandfather told me that I should stop drinking so much milk because clearly I was over consuming (I hit puberty early and was developing breasts at this time: it was the breasts that ""offended"" him). I remember how all my male relatives just stopped interacting with me or being affectionate with me once I got my period. I remember my grandparents telling my mother and I to dress modestly and cover ourselves even at home and in just their presence. I remember when our male housekeeper forcefully kissed me and told me to tell no one, and I remember how filled with guilt I was, and I remember being told that if I were to ever be ""unchaste"" that my future husband would know. I remember when my mother told me I deserved to get raped because I liked wearing shorts and dresses. I remember my mother telling me I was a slut and all I wanted was boys to notice me. \n\nFor years I believed that even though I was agnostic/atheist that Islam was peaceful and women had rights in Islamic society. What is so poisonous about Islam\'s stance on women and their expected roles is that it maintains that men and women hold equal value and worth in God\'s eyes, but that they are simply ""different"". I used to believe that the hijab encouraged modesty, and it allowed a person to truly be seen as herself, without being judged for her body. I can\'t believe how blind I was to the truth - that a society in which a woman has to cover her body -her vessel to experience life and the world - to feel empowered, and free from male gaze and ""bias"" is not a free, egalitarian society. A woman should not have to conceal her body in order to feel confident and safe. Her body isn\'t by default tainted by the sin of sex, beauty and lust - her body is her vessel to move, breathe, get around, exist in the world. Everything else is a message ascribed to it. \n\nThe fact that a porn niche for hijabis exists says everything. It\'s full of captions like ""hijabi slut chokes on fat cock"" and ""hijab slut pounded on prayer rug"". If that doesn\'t tell us something I don\'t know what will. Womanhood gets exploited and sexualized no matter what a woman says or does, no matter how much or little she wears. I remember a time when I wanted to cut my breasts off because it seemed to be the thing that denied me familial affection. It pains me to see other little girls suffering through this bullshit now, and having the hijab forced onto them. And having this sexist cult forced onto them. There is nothing innate about a woman that is sinful and needing to be covered up.', ""Welcome (out of lurking, that is), and thanks so much for your post!

It's definitely a very vulnerable period for many of us apostates, especially women. And there's no structured support to help us as we transition from a highly controlled (and usually abusive) environment to one that is fairly exposed with no one looking out for us. The Ex communities are well meaning and informal, but obviously as your experience and that of others shows the risk of yet more exploitation and preying on by men is high. \n\nI was a fairly active poster many years ago on an Ex Muslim forum (CEMB). It was a great place and we women looked out for each other as we knew we were vulnerable to men due to lack of life and sexual experience. It sounds as if the Ex Muslim landscape has changed completely over the years with the influx of liberal feminism. That saddens me. \n\nI'm glad you feel at home in rad fem spaces! \nMy feminism doesn't really have a label as I agree with a number of rad fem and liberal concepts, while also disagreeing with others. I just tend to speak up my mind on whatever bothers me. I'm also unashamedly polyamorous and kinky but realise it's not for most people and like most things in life, is very open to exploitation by men. \n\nI really wish girls and young women had spaces to learn how to be confident in themselves and speak their mind, critically examine whatever norms and trends are doing the rounds, and be unafraid to challenge people on their ideas. This damn socialisation of trying to be nice to everyone has to be dismantled!

avgaur,avgaur,FtMtF: Detransitioned TiF,"Hi GC,

The reason I'm posting this on a new account is because I delete and cycle my reddit accounts for the sake of anonymity every few months, and I wanted to leave this account up.

I'm a 21 year old adult female human living in Scotland. I first identified as transgender age 15/16. Started hormones at 18. Top surgery December 2017.

Throughout my treatment, I was never offered therapy relating to gender. I was just told Yes. In fact, I don't think they were allowed to question me or ask where my beliefs came from. I seriously regret most aspects of my transition. Luckily for me, testosterone didn't react well, meaning I got barely any side effects. My voice is still solidly in the female range, my body comp never changed. The only lasting side effects from T that bother me are the facial hair and enlarged clit. But to be honest, the average woman who struggles with PCOS has more facial hair than me, and if they can handle it I bloody well can!

Obviously the biggest thing I did was have a double mastectomy with chest wall reconstruction. I am of two minds as to whether I regret this. On the one hand, I despised my DD chest and wearing bras. It was never comfortable for me. In fact having the surgery and feeling so happy with my body was a huge factor that made me realise I wasn't trans. I just have body dysmorphia/ an eating disorder (undiagnosed because NHS mental health support is...non existent and I'm too poor for private).

However. I had to spend a lot of money travelling to Manchester and back to get the surgery, and the after care was atrocious. Aesthetically my results are good, but I got pneumonia after surgery. Then I had consistent pain which developed into a staph infection in my left breast. I still have pain. I went to the doctors many times but they couldn't get me seen. My post op check up is THIS SATURDAY. That's...14 months almost since my operation.

I have been publically detrans for about 4 months now. Changing my name back and explaining to everyone was horrible, but my family are all so relieved. My mother says by the time I'm 30 it will all be an embarrassing teenage phase. Except goths don't usually get life changing surgery.

All I can say is thank god I woke up when I did. They were fast tracking me for a hysto. Still no therapy. There isn't even a specialised clinic in the North.

I am not open about my radical feminism. I would be labelled a transphobe by all my woke friends. But I no longer believe in gender theory, trans theory, none of it. I can't believe I fucked myself up based on patriarchal bullshit because I was a tomboy.

My reason for posting this is because I see people complaining detrans aren't visible enough. It's hard to be visible because LGBT groups hate to acknowledge us. They want us silenced. Read their rhetoric online and see them calling detrans people idiotic, crazy, liars, TERFs.

Well...I am a TERF. I'm an adult human female, and I think that the amount of young people identifying as trans and being fast tracked through surgery and hormones and legal changes with NO THERAPY OR QUESTIONING is absolutely insane.

So I'm here, anonymously but visible to GC. I'm not quite brave enough to out myself as GC to the wider world. ""Social suicide"".

It was  never comfortable for me.  \n>  \n> I can\'t believe I fucked myself up based on patriarchal bullshit because I was a tomboy. \n\nDon\'t beat yourself up over anything here - women do get breast reduction surgeries because beyond a certain size some women do not find them physically comfortable (back pain and all) and aside from the infection stuff you are dealing with (which is unfortunate and I hope it gets better soon). It doesn\'t sound like physically any permanent damage has been done per se aside from being able to breast-feed (which you can totally work around, assuming you ever want kids which you may not anyways). Hysterectomy would\'ve been another story but fortunately you dodged that bullet. If you get any nosy busy-bodies commenting, you don\'t even have to get into detransitioning, you can just say you had breast reduction surgery for health/comfort reasons and leave it at that.\n\nThere\'s a huge, *huge* amount of misinformation from the trans-activism community out there and a distressing lack of support for therapy, particularly with respect to gender and dysmorphia, with the ones that do exist often attacked by trans-activists ([Kenneth Zucker\'s identity clinic for instance](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-doctor-fired-from-gender-identity-clinic-says-he-feels-vindicated/)). And the fact that so many cases of people who transition and find themselves unhappy afterwards are totally swept under the rug by the trans-activism movement is really irresponsible. It\'s selling something that really ends up being a band-aid solution instead of really addressing the deeper root causes of someone\'s dysmorphia.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying that *this is totally, 100%, not your fault or something to beat yourself up or be ashamed of.* Do not beat yourself up over this, *you are not to blame.*\n\nStories like this are why gender critical voices get so upset when kids are fast-tracked to transition at the first signs of not conforming with gender stereotypes, and why we absolutely want to push-back on the trans-activism that\'s promoting this. We\'re living in a sadly regressive time where gender-non-conformity is viewed as strange (when it\'s the stereotyping itself that should be strange!); tomboys and tomgirls are being erroneously taught by the messaging they\'re hearing that perhaps they\'re not really girls or boys and their identities must be rigidly defined and boxed by their interests and how they dress. It\'s truly upsetting.\n\n> In fact, I don\'t think they were allowed to question me or ask where my beliefs came from. \n\nThis is really terrifying to hear a first-hand account, but as we\'ve seen in recent times, doctors and therapists are threatened with the label of bigotry or with discipline if they say ""hold on, let\'s chat about why you think you might be trans"". They seem to be forced to go full-steam-ahead when someone approaches them saying they\'re trans, without any way to stop and chat about maybe the underlying reasons someone might be feeling dysmorphic and unhappy with their body.\n\n&#x200B;', ""Thank-you for posting this.

I also have DD breasts. I'm so sorry the doctors encouraged you to cut them off for the sake of a lie.

Sad that you never got a chance to come to love your body as it was given to you, and to appreciate your breasts. For example, my dear little dog (we put her down a few months ago) used to love to come up next to me and rest her head against my boob. I loved those snuggles. Little things like that make me love my body and make buying the special sports bras more than worth it to me.  \n\n\nI really think you should be completely open at your follow up appointment that you are now 'detrans' and already regret the surgery. Ask them where you put in ethics complaints, because this shouldn't be happening to young women. This is not your fault. You were brainwashed as a child, and put on drugs which can alter your mental state as a teenager. It was your doctors responsibility to make sure that elective surgeries like this one are necessary and appropriate and they failed to do that. If you had been given a year of proper therapy at 18 you probably would not have had a double mastectomy. Even if you are happy with your body now, it's possible that you could have become happy with your body without the surgery and you should have been given that chance.  \n\n\nWhat's done is done though, and you're happy with your body now, so I'm happy for you that that's worked out well. Even though you haven't mentioned it, I pre-emptively want to encourage you to wear summer dresses or bikinis (with out without the top half) if you feel inclined to. There is no cup size requirement to wear whatever you like, girly or not. This is still YOUR body, even though it has been altered.

b8ejga,b8ejga,Liberal feminists’ casual racism,"This is something I’ve noticed as a brown woman who’s been on the internet for many years.

When libfems attempt to engage GC feminists in any type of discussion, they assume we (GC) are coming from a place of privilege and they or the people they’re defending are the oppressed/marginalised party. 

I have been called white more times than I can count. No one has ever assumed I was anything other than white despite the fact that radical feminist ideas are most popular in Asia/Africa/South America. Indian feminists are concerned with stopping rape, not with promoting ~sex positivity~. Average Iranian women would be considered “whorephobic”. The Somali woman who calls it FEMALE genital mutilation isn’t concerned with being exclusionary. Their ignorance of other cultures is astounding. 

Even if they know you’re not white and thus aren’t ~privileged~ in that way, they’ll still play the oppression olympics. Do you remember that comment on Facebook about the Pakistani woman talking about the difficulties woman in Pakistan have finding menstrual products getting derailed by TIMs whining about their “periods”? 

If I were white, it’s like that would trump any other hardships I may have experienced ever. (It’s usually white libfems saying this!) And if they find out I’m not white, then clearly I’m just an idiot from the developing world who doesn’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. 

For people claiming to be so concerned with intersectionality, they sure are racist, eh?

They think white is the default. \n\nOnce I had someone following me around calling me a terf, and they mentioned that I’m Latina every time for no reason. It was confusing, until I realized - they’re so excited to shit on brown women. Normally, when they harass women of color, they get in trouble. They are just so gleeful to be allowed to bully brown women. \n\nIntersectionality is a very important idea, but some of them don’t even understand the concept. They just think it means you get to say “nuh uh I’m not privileged” when someone points out that maybe white men shouldn’t be the loudest voices in every conversation about race and gender equality ', 'There was a REALLY good article posted here the other day about Indian women’s experiences with things such as forced prostitution, single sex bathrooms and FGM. They were pretty much like “wtf is wrong with western feminists we do not want to share bathrooms with men and prostitution is trafficking”\n\nGuess they are secretly privileged white women!', 'One of the two most famous/powerful university in my country recently released a guide (from their official student\'s union) to spotting \'undercover terfs\' and it included the line ""the \'sex binary\' is a colonial fiction created to oppress trans, queer, and gender-non-conforming people (esp. of indigenous genders), and people of colour as a whole, as well as women""\n\nThis co-opting is so fucking insulting, and the erasure of the different forms of misogyny women across the world have faced for thousands of years is something else. It reeks of arrogance, ""we taught you these ideas, and now we will free you from them"" as if western culture is the only one capable of progressing, making change, or thinking for itself', '[deleted]', 'Tell me about it! They have no clue how racist it is to compare transwomen wanting to be considered women to being black. They use all people of color as talking points.', 'I absolutely understand you. It\'s weird, IRL one American friend told me that his 4yo nice may be transgender and I told him that they should wait because it\'s a kid - He gave the most condescending ""your country it\'s too Catholic"" speech ever\nIf I said something like that on the internet I get the - ""Would this yt lady shut up?"" Type of comments\n\nWe don\'t have a say, and don\'t get me started on colorism. It has a similar effect whiting our communities', ""YES  \n\n\nOnly the most privileged women can afford liberal feminism, because it's essentially coping with patriarchy, not fighting it. And the greater the magnitude of patriarchy the more obvious this is. "", 'Black women are also used as a sort of proof that of course the feminists would snub TIMs. Like since there were issues that led to intersectional feminism, obviously privileged feminists have found another blind spot. It’s just about always other white women who make this argument, and none of them can actually cite any of those contentions. They just want a shield. ', 'Most libfems get their ""information"" from memes and cult leaders on sites like facebook, instagram, tumblr and reddit. They put little to no intellectual thought and particularly, historical considerations, to their polemics.\n\nThey\'re lazy, used to being spoon fed what to believe and growing up in ultra privileged cosy communities means they have no interest in or knowledge of how other people live. \n\nMost of them would be hard pressed to even locate the countries you\'ve mentioned on a globe.\n\nSo there\'s an embedded implicit racism in even their most casual commentary.\n\nOF course white trans identified males are the *most* oppressed ever, unless you consider the oft mentioned but never sighted TWOCSW who are, if social media is to be believed, have been murdered and assaulted in such high numbers it\'s a wonder there are any left.\n\nIt\'s fucking exhausting.', ""I think it's more of a class divide than just racism. I'm a filipina in ph and I know acquaintances (that just so happened to be from the wealthier side of life) who spouts tra/queer stuffs all the time. Just like western woke folks. You'd think that they would know better than to jump in that bandwagon especially with the situation ph right now. But nooo, it's better to be woke and trendy. It's really disappointing to say the least."", 'They are mostly sheltered ignorant children who think anyone who *isn\'t* white/straight/middle class/able-bodied/""normal"" is disgusting, but they themselves are morally superior because they will *pretend tolerance of their disgust.* The grosser they find a group of people, the harder they will posture tolerance, the better they will feel about themselves. And it is *all* about their self-image, never about any power analysis at all.', 'Remember when Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was accused of being a white feminist?', 'Libfems are usually some of the most privileged people on the planet.\n\nWhite, college-educated, upper-middle class, access to affordable healthcare, the list goes on. So much of liberal feminism comes from a place of cozy ignorance. ', 'They call it white to shut it down and because they don’t understand are arguments.\n\nWe want to restrict prostitution which is often full of WoC? We must be white feminists, because only with white privileged could we ever believe that getting rid of prostitution -an income for many WoC- could be a good thing.\n\nThey don’t recognise either that the idea of radical feminism -that we’re oppressed for our SEX and that we need to fight men/the patriarchy to relieve our oppression- is just feminism in most other countries, like you said OP. Women experience FGM, are raped, and are forcibly married at a young age due to their sex, not their gender.\n\nBut libfems can shut our arguments down by calling us ‘white feminists’ because everyone just think ‘oh, that’s a bad thing’ even though we’re not white feminists. They constantly tell us that we don’t understand ~intersectional feminism~ when we understand it more than them. They just tell us that because we fight sex-based oppression and to do that you have to recognise that our sex is oppressed, not ‘femininity’ or ‘gender’, by men which they can’t accept.', ""Yes, I have experienced this too many times and it eventually drove me away from being a libfem because of how much they will actually silence non-white women like me speaking about their own experiences. \n\nAccusing you of being white only because they don't agree with you happens CONSTANTLY, most ironically from white women themselves.\n\nIntersectionality is a lie."", ""I believe it's the biggest reason why so many WOC in Europe really don't want to identify as feminists. I've met some who are very active and effective in helping other women and their children but who don't identify with the label, and don't know the difference between liberal and radical feminism. Most people who have actually seen suffering in their life can't identify with libfem ideals."", ""Oh yeah, this is one of the biggest reasons why I can't be around libfems. At my undergrad uni the group there always used black women as token when they made comparisons and talked about transwomen. It was disgusting, and I sat there as a mixed black girl and listened to that garbage and the more I read it online, the more my blood boiled. They don't get it. Also online, most libfems also thought I was white, which I don't get why they think everyone is white? It's just weird and not accepting. I feel way more accepted by radfems. You all get it, and don't exclude me and actually listen to the issues I experience as a WOC."", 'Yes they are racist. Another example I can think of is that they’d never wear a Hijab themselves but they’ll see it fit for women of colour to be treated that way because “it’s their culture and they like it.” \n\nBeing white definitely does not trump sexism either. ', '>Indian feminists are concerned with stopping rape, not with promoting ~sex positivity~. Average Iranian women would be considered “whorephobic”. The Somali woman who calls it FEMALE genital mutilation isn’t concerned with being exclusionary. Their ignorance of other cultures is astounding.\n\nPut this on a plaque so everyone can see it.\n\nSo fucking true. LibFem, like all Liberalism is extremely ethnocentric in terms of white middle and upper class women. They are the ones that benefit from liberalism afterall.', 'It\'s all part of the Oppression Olympics - if they can label GC views as ""white"" they have already won, because duh \'privilege\'. ', ""Yes. They cast GC women in a narrow mold in order to villify us. That sounds so patronizing. I'm glad you're able to contribute here."", 'I honestly hate those type of people — it’s not what feminism is supposed to be about. These people are ruining the concept of women’s rights. ', 'I agree. \nThey practice what I would call “benevolent racism”, but that’s a nice way of putting it. They seem to subscribe to the noble savage idea, taking cultural relativism to the extreme and shitting all over the women and children who are harmed by it- those who aren’t Western, white, or middle class especially. \nI don’t have much to add to what everyone has already said, except that it’s often occurred to me how women who argue for and advocate for trans activism do so from a place of ignorant privilege. I’m sure this intersects with race. For example, women who think we are TERFs for not wanting males in women’s bathrooms; I’m willing to bet they have never been a working class woman cleaning public toilets after dark, alone, as her shift ends. I’m willing to bet they’ve never slept in a bus station overnight out of necessity , using the women’s toilets to wash- using the women’s toilets as a safe space to get away from the predators who spot a young woman down on her luck. They’ve never driven for miles or sat on a bus for miles, running scared, no money, forced to stay in sketchy places where sketchy men hang out- looking around furtively in the rest stop bathroom, with children, alone. \nWomen who shill for liberal bullshit have been largely unscathed by the male violence and danger that you encounter when you’re not running about universities without a care in the world.', 'Ugh, I once as a libfem called a Latinx man “white” because he basically said that we needed research trans folks more and I assumed that position would only come from a straight white guy. Cringe. Sorry, my dude. \n\nThe libfems that I know are all college students whose parents pay for their rent and think that selling pictures of their feet to weirdos to buy dabs is “sex work”. For the most part, no libfems that I know have actually met a woman who has done sex work (I do, and they sure didn’t like it) and never interact with woc or people from different parts of the world. Only the privileged can live in such ignorant bliss to think that sex work is empowering (the same way that men who wear makeup think it’s empowering), and have never actually considered what it’s like to be so desperate for income that you will sell your body to just ANYBODY and have sex with nasty, abusive, creepy men.\n\nAdditionally, most of the libfems I know have a piss poor understanding of intersectional feminism. I wouldn’t say that I’m any expert, it’s something I’m currently trying to develop more, but it really is just parroted, superficial bullshit. Buzz phrases like “your feminism should include ALL women!” Typically means white TiMs, not women of color.  ', '>And if they find out I’m not white, then clearly I’m just an idiot from the developing world who doesn’t know what the fuck I’m talking about.\n\nPreach!  \nPrecisely my own experience, sister. Sadly, not only from liberal ""feminists"", but sometimes from the radicals as well.', 'I\'m one of those women whose background, except for my color, would be very similar to a minority woman, not a ""middle-class, liberal, educated white woman"".  When you look at me, perhaps that may be what you think you ""see"" but it is not.  In fact, most younger minority women probably had similar or even better childhoods, even adulthoods than some white women like me, at least economically and socially.  I\'m a bit put off by being stereotyped just because I\'m white and was born that way, not made that way.\n\nWere you and your 2 sisters orphaned by losing your mother when you were in the second grade?  Did you have to ever use an outhouse (or even know what one is)?  Did you constantly have to prove that you were worthy of the same praise middle class kids were?  Did you have one pair of shoes to wear all year long as a teenager?  Did you always have to sleep with your sister or on a pallet?  Did your diet consist mainly of carbohydrates?  Was the only medical and dental treatment you had was to pull an abscessed tooth until you were an adult and could pay for it yourself?  Did you drop out of HS just 2 mos after the first semester because you knew you could not attend college, there was no money for you even though you were #2 in your class?  Was birth control information withheld from you even after you had 2 children as a teenager?  Did you always live in rentals until you could buy your own house at age 38?  When minority women were finally starting to be hired in the 60s in jobs I held, I cheered them on, encouraged them to apply for jobs they didn\'t think they were ""qualified"" for.\n\nAre you a feminist because of *your own oppression*? Were you a working class woman working to support her children who were abandoned when others in your class were making fun of middle class feminists who were accused of both class and race bias, lesbianism, and whose good names were smeared in the mainstream press? A woman who *thought* she would not have  a common bond with women 10 yrs younger, single, more educated?  Women who were at least able to think, analyze, discuss and write about what perhaps you and others could not but found common cause with?  I opened myself up to those women, and I learned everything I could from them and other working class women *and* minority women who came to womens liberation from the depths of their own oppression by men joined in as well. \n\n\nIt wasn\'t perfect, but it was us, women who were dealing with what they had to put up with in life from males--even males we loved, males we raised, males in all of our lives.  Women who made inroads into what, who, what constituted that oppression.\n\nAnd women who knew there were other ways to live.', ""It's one of the reasons I was never a libfem tbh. I never got into it because not only did it not make sense but they kept pretending woc didn't exist until they needed some token non-white to back up their bullshit.\n\nExpecting lesbians to like dick(I thought I was bi back then and still saw through this shit) and ignoring the oppression women, especially woc, face with their 'cis privilege' was a 'its a no from me, dawg'.\n\nWe are practically invisible to them imo. Libfems always say radfems are 'white women', ignoring how many WOC there are, from underdeveloped countries no less. I found radical feminism through a WOC blog's I stumbled across and I was shocked to see a woman talking about issues that affected me and women like me.\n\nThis is unrelated, but it's fucking shit how many straight and bisexual and white women only peak transed and peak libfemmed when they could no longer talk about their own bodies. They were more than happy to socially pressure lesbians into sleeping with men and ignore the struggles WOC face that liberal feminism refused to address. "", '>\tAverage Iranian women would be considered “whorephobic”\n\nDid you mean Iranian women are against prostitution (and rightly so) or something else? From my own experience, Iranian women are more likely than not to be against ”sex negativity” since they liken that to the Islamic government’s stance on sex and women. I’ve found that Iranians are less receptive to radical feminism because discussions that go against sex positivity / liberal feminism are assumed to come from an Islamic conservative viewpoint and they’re on the defensive against that (even if it comes from another woman).', ""They are actually pretty racist, but have zero self-awareness, and can't see the irony in anything they do or say.

cyn12x,cyn12x,Just posted this rant on Clementine Ford's Facebook: felt good to get it off my chest. Thought I would share here because she'll probably delete it from her page.,"Context: Clementine Ford is an Australian celebrity feminist and kinda famous. 

Earlier today she posted link to contrapoint's video about TERFs and announced that she would purge gender critical feminism from her page.

I commented with this:

> The man who raped me now calls himself a woman.

> Trans activists have sent me messages telling me that they want to shove their dicks down my unwilling throat, that they want me to kill myself, they have sent me detailed fantasies of how they want to kill me and violate my corpse - and all because I don't believe that men who declare they are woman really are women.

> Men systematically abuse women for a reason. Because they were born male under a patriarchy that teaches men and boys to act in this way.

> Nothing about taking hormones, having surgeries, altering your biology, your pronouns, or the way you talk and dress changes this.

> This is why trans activists argue that it's transphobic to refuse them sex, this explains why they can't handle it and threaten violence when we don't see them in the way they see themselves. 

> It's what every other guy with a fragile ego does. They respond with aggression when women tell them 'no'.

> Every single criticism that feminists like Clementine Ford have made of men applies to all men - even those who no longer identify as men.

> Clementine: would you try to force us to pretend that the men who raped us weren't really men? 

> Would you try to deny that we can understand what men do to us?


Update: Clementine Ford just posted a new status that began with this:

> This is a callout to men and anyone assigned male at birth - I'm writing an article about the experiences men have had of negative socialisation. Ie being instructed through parents, friends, society etc on how to ""be a man"" in ways that have had a negative impact on you. 

> Things like ""man up"", ""stop crying like a girl"", don't play with dolls or other toys coded as feminine, don't wear pink, what are ya some kind of bloody POOF etc. 

> It's going to be a longish piece that explores how challenging regressive ideas of stoic, rigid masculinity is the way to liberate men from the way patriarchy harms them. You can email me on my name at Gmail dot com.

> Happy obviously to use pseudonyms in the piece and interested to know particularly about the relationship between parents and sons and between male friends and how this formed/forms your own behaviour as men.

Lumping men and AMABs in the same category is a step in the right direction. But It's still missing the point. We shouldn't be focusing on how patriarchy harms men. We should focus on how patriarchy teaches men to harm women.",539,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

Firstly because I’m against women, including prostituted women being used as collateral for men who refuse to see women as anything other than a receptacle for them to use, and secondly because the whole idea of ‘just using a prostitute’ feeds into the notion that sex is something men are entitled to, that it’s a need. \n\nYou see it all the time with people arguing that disabled men should be given access to a prostitute so they don’t ‘miss out’ yet no one ever suggests women with disabilities should go and see a male prostitute because that would be outrageous. No one ever stops to think about whether a female prostitute would feel comfortable engaging in sex with a disabled man or an incel because now there’s money involved nobody actually thinks of these women as people with their own thoughts and feelings but as a product that they can pick up and use.\n\nThe way sex is commodified truly disgusts me.', '""I\'m scared of these men because they are violent and hate women.

This completely eliminates a woman\'s agency and the sidesteps the rights of women to pursue sex (or not) with whom they want and for their own pleasure.  \n\n\nAnd the thing is, it\'s a longstanding issue.  In the Middle Ages, the Catholic church ran brothels because it was thought that while the women who worked in them were certainly destined for hell, it was a service they provided to keep other women ""untainted.""', 'This is what these poor women are subjected to by these guys:\n\nhttp://invisible-men-canada.tumblr.com', 'One of the biggest problems these assholes have is that they\'ve already made up their narrow minds about what the problem is. \n\nI remember a post a few months ago, the guy told this long saga about how upset he was that his ""ex girlfriend"" was marrying someone else, and he was still in love with her. The points were that he has three women he has history with. He believes he\'s gotten shafted in life in all three relationships. The most recent woman is only marrying her fiancé because “everyone” wants her to. He has to date someone who is as hot as Instagram models because everyone else is fat and ugly. These were not isolated qualities. Everyone was both, and he acted like not being found attractive by him was a disease. His friends will make fun of him for being with someone hideous, instead of Kylie Jenner (??) or other hot girls from the internet. \n\nAnd everyone tried to explain that his thinking was the problem. I probably read 500 comments explaining it, and the man wouldn’t stop complaining how he was getting dicked over by life. He’d copy and pasta a comment about all the women and how he was horribly mistreated by them not wanting to be with him, and dating/marrying people they did want a life with. \n\nI tried to put it in terms of how the women may feel about a strange man fixating on them and deciding they were meant to be. I explained that it’s disrespectful to call grown women “females” and “girls,” and that to be honest, I’d be livid if a friend set me up with someone like him, whether I’m fat or not. Then the guy sent me a ton of messages about why I can’t have empathy for him, and can’t I just see life has shit on him by not giving him this girl he wants. \n\nI actually went back and re read what was still there a week or so ago when I was trying to find a different old post, so a lot of this is fresh for me.

ca0wid,ca0wid,Got my period at work unexpectedly and was shamed,"Long time lurker (using this account to post here and in the pcos subreddit for anonymity). 

Today I got my period at work and didn’t have any of my pads or anything. I felt so embarrassed and scared. I felt myself about to have an anxiety attack so I left the bathroom scared that I’d end up with a stain by the end of the day. 

I stepped out to the bathroom to let my manager  know what happened (I was visibly nervous and could barely speak up). I asked if I could step out for ten minutes to buy a pad. Bare in mind that she’s a woman herself, and one time traded stories with my other female coworkers about getting her period during an important meeting. But instead of empathizing with me and letting me leave she shamed me. She told me, actually no she *berated* me for not know when my period comes (I have *fucking* pcos irregularities is literally the most prevalent symptom!!). She said that if I *chose* to step out she’d write me down as absent for the remainder of my shift.

I was minutes from crying. I had to sit at work for another 4 hours, bleeding through my outfit. I grab my cardigan from my bag and tied it around my waist. The thing that upset me even more is the fact that she’s a FULL supporter of TiMs and even raised hell to turn the women’s bathroom “gender inclusive”....but said nothing about the men’s bathroom. 

I work in the engineering field and it’s hard to find lots of women in this field. In my office there’s only 6. There’s hundreds of men though and more TiMs then women (20-30 depending on their “feelings”). 

I was so close to just breaking down and leaving. Idk how she can rationalize allowing one of the TiM coworkers leave early two weeks ago because his “hormones were making him cranky and sad uwu” and then telling me to “act like a big girl and suck it up”. How the hell was I meant to suck it up? I’m fucking bleeding you dip shit! 

I’m going between being angry, crying, embarrassed and confused. This is the same woman who congratulated me on coming out a non-binary because I shaved me head last year. I fucking hate her and my office for always prioritizing TiMs over us women. Just the past 6 months they’ve hired more TiMs instead of women because “muh diversity”. 

Crazy thing is I’m the ONLY black woman (and there’s only two other black people, both men). All the TiMs that have been hired in the past year are all white men, aged 26-31. I literally have to prove myself everyday because a) woman in engineering b) black woman in engineering. 

I hate this place sooo much. If you read this much thank you.

Edit; I only posted this an hour ago and so many of y’all have showed me so much support and sent me beautiful messages! Y’all really made me see my worth and that nobody should be treated this way. Thank y’all I’m actually now applying to new places and I’m going to lay low until I find something!! Thank you all soo much💗💗 I hope only good things happen to y’all!!!!

Edit: thank you all for the lovely messages and those who I haven’t responded to thank you!! 

And to those reading from and posting my post in other subs, I can’t believe I have to write this out. 

Of course I’m not going to put down my actual field, I literally wrote down below how it’s a small field and would not like to write down the exact field so I put down the one close to it. I have co workers who frequent reddit and what happened to me wasn’t a fan secret. how dumb of me would it be to put down my exact field? I’ve already put down so many identifiable things. And of course the 20-30 is a dam exaggeration. Can you not tell? Should I have put down the exact amount of trans identified people and out myself even more?? I’m trying to escape this hell hole unscathed tf.  And to those that are shocked there’s no feminine products in the bathroom....welcome to the real world. Not every work place or public bathroom carries feminine products. 

I’ve seen co workers write things online to vent and then boom their secret not so secret post pulled up in front of them and they get fired. Idk y I’m even explaining myself. 

And I’m happy that some of y’all have these amazing jobs where you can leave mid shift and not be penalized, I don’t, not everyone has that luxury.

It\'s also totally understandable if you don\'t want to sue (time and money and headache and all that. I\'ve not sued for all kinds of terrible treatment, which is true of most women I know and most people of color I know, so of course doubly true if you\'re doubly in their crosshairs). My sister was fired because she was sexually harassed by her boss\'s husband and spoke up about it, something nearly impossible to prove as ostensibly she was fired for checking Facebook on an office computer during her lunch break. I\'ve been fired after filing for ADA accommodations in an attempt to stop a company\'s mistreatment of me. I\'ve had incompetent HR reps look directly at my paperwork, when they\'re not supposed to know why I\'m filing (people get extremely uncomfortable if they find out you have a mental illness, especially something like bipolar disorder or PTSD). I\'ve had an ADA request for an earlier schedule (at a job that could be done from anywhere, at any time of day) denied and then been fired right after filing for accommodation.\n\nOn the other hand, at a college, say, where simply disclosing ""I have a stress-related illness, please try not to fuck up my classes"" to your boss is not enough to protect you, filing an ADA accommodation request is a good idea, as it is at a large, competent company, who understands the threat of lawsuits (I COULD sue that other company into the ground, but I simply don\'t care enough, although they were proper assholes to me). I\'d say file it. Basically, you are using your disability to ask for basic human rights that we should all have. \n\nI have used ADA accommodations to ask for: a decent schedule during bus hours to make it possible to get to work (denied, then fired without cause); non-timed bathroom breaks, and call-ins when I\'m feeling shitty (granted, at a large corporate company); and now, I suppose that I will be asking that an employer take extra care when making my schedule to double-check it with me before having it go live (yes, I am using ADA to ask that my department head stops fucking up), and, if there\'s a mistake that was made, that it be fixed rather than left up to me to suck it up, fix it myself, or simply lose the class I was promised or be put in the position of being forced to turn down a class they\'ll have trouble staffing because they so royally fucked it up; so yes, I am using my disability to ask for basic rights. It is TRUE that being treated like shit by an employer for whom my father worked for 25 years, and for whom I\'ve worked three years under trying circumstances tirelessly, is a life stressor for me (they already pay shit, give no benefits, and are extremely exploitative of their adjunct professors), which does worsen my stress and trigger symptoms of my stress-related illness, but it\'s kind of ridiculous I need to trot out this medical reason to get the bare minimum of human decency from an employer.\n\nSimilarly, EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO LEAVE WORK FOR AN EMERGENCY. If you need to leave work for ten minutes, you get to go, EVEN IF IT\'S JUST TO CLEAR YOUR HEAD BECAUSE, SAY, YOU\'RE HAVING A BAD MOMENT. If you\'re fucking BLEEDING THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES, you get to go, no questions asked.\n\nHow large is the company? Is the HR department competent, or incompetent? If they\'re incompetent and you\'re in a right to hire, right to fire state, they could use this against you to fire you, and then you\'d be out of a job, might need to file for unemployment (which is a huge hassle in this country and doesn\'t garner you much money in most states), and you\'d have a bigger cause for a lawsuit, but would still have to file said lawsuit, and it usually isn\'t worth it for how mentally exhausting it feels to have to file a lawsuit (I could have sued so many people abusing positions of authority--employers and landlords--for violating my rights by now, but they count on most people not wanting to do that, and they\'re right).\n\nIf you work for a large, reputable company with a good HR department, definitely file an ADA claim in the meanwhile while looking for another job. When it comes to accommodations, don\'t just ask for the ability to leave in case of an emergency, ask for days off if you ever have any heavy bleeding, or otherwise have symptoms that make it difficult for you to work (I don\'t know too much about PCOS, but my sister has endometriosis...I think she just sucks it up and works through the pain, but she takes so much ibuprofen she gets stomach bleeding, which isn\'t good. I wish she would also using ADA accommodations to stay home when she\'s bleeding heavily and in pain). Stand up for yourself and your rights. Remember you do NOT need to tell the HR reps what disease or disability you have, you simply need to give your requests after getting a note from your doctor.\n\nFurthermore, rather than suing you could file a complaint with HR about your boss, and, if possible, see if you can get a new supervisor. I only wouldn\'t do this if you are still going to get a recommendation from said boss, and you really need it, and don\'t think you could get a recommendation from the new supervisor instead; recommendations can be worth their weight in gold in this economy, so in that case, it might be best to lie low while you\'re looking for another job and make sure to always carry a pad in the meantime.\n\nI have started looking at employers as being like men. Most of them are awful, and will exploit you given the opportunity. Working for them is like being in an abusive relationship. However, some are great, and treat you well. It\'s not worth staying with the former kind, and wasting your time and talent, as well devaluing your own worth in that way. The minute you have a situation in which an employer treats you badly (or even if you\'re not satisfied at work; why not aim high and reach for the stars, try to get what you really want? You have a ton of marketable skills, and YOU bring the labor that your employers need--they need YOU, not vice versa), start making a plan to leave.\n\nI am making a plan to leave now. I smoothed it over with the college that mistreated me, so that I can do a free post-secondary education program while I teach there (that\'s one perk since we don\'t get benefits: we can take free classes). I\'m biding my time, doing my bit, laying low, and not expecting much help while I work on my escape plan.\n\nBest of luck to you and just remember, you don\'t deserve this. This reflects on your employer, not on you. Get out, know your worth, and go somewhere where not only do you have basic human rights and are treated like an equal rather than a peon, but where you are treated well and your valuable work is valued.\n\nGood luck!!', ""WTF -- why didn't your boss offer you a pad or let you go buy one? Every female has been there once or twice at least. \n\nAlso you're in a high-level career where you would presume she would have the sophistication to let you deal with it appropriately. \n\nThis is so abnormal, it sounds like she could be a sociopath -- like she wanted you to be humiliated. \n\nI would start documenting this behavior very carefully and talk to a civil rights/employment lawyer because she is begging to get the company sued."", 'I know this was posted awhile ago but I wanted to stop and say that this is clearly a display of horrible leadership and your manager is 100% accountable for her bad choices. You did not deserve this at all. You did nothing wrong. A good leader would have ensured you were ok and moved on. I am so sorry this happened to you. I hope you find a better job elsewhere!', 'I totally relate and think that was shitty. But taking the time off wouldn’t have been so bad.', 'Well, that sucks and I am sorry she did that.\n\nI\'m assuming that she was under some kind of pressure regarding other stuff and she took her own stress out on you. It\'s a lot easier to be supportive of people if they seem like no threat to you, eg TIMs and NBs etc.   \nI suspect this woman has projected her own career experiences onto you, since you\'re both women in a male field, and instead of sympathising, she\'s gotten angry with you for making the same ""mistake"" she would berate herself for making.  \nIf you can get a chance to talk to her about it when it\'s blown over, I think you should, and she might be feeling like a terrible person herself right now for taking her issues out on you.']",['non-binary'],GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/ca0wid/got_my_period_at_work_unexpectedly_and_was_shamed/,True

-Most obviously, any discussion NOT initiated by a TIM about lesbianism and not being attracted to men and their penis is shut down immediately

-Top post of all time is about transbians 

-Top posts are mostly memes from TIMs now or cheesy text posts from “actual lesbians” absolutely hugboxing, virtue signaling, and fawning over transbians whereas before the trans takeover it was more thoughtful discussion posts. The sub heavily reflects traaa

-A shit ton of anime memes (similarly found in traaaa)

Talk of “doms” and “subs” or tops/bottoms which was never a thing in the lesbian community in a linguistic context. We might have said “giver, receiver” but never dom/sub/BDSM language. 

-The absolute, blatant gaslighting regarding radical feminism. According to that sub, radical feminists are racist, rich, elitist, misogynistic, violent, secretly homophobic, nazis, extremely religious, conservatives, gender essentialists, etc.

-Almost every single post gets dominated by the “trans perspective”

-Self-aware TIM posts are highly upvoted but immediately shut down in the comments, citing internalized misogyny, insecurity, and transphobia

cxwq88,cxwq88,TIMs are EVERYWHERE on reddit!!!,"I remember when I was in my brainwashed trans phase that I'd scroll through trans-related subs for hours. I was a TIF, so, I would look for FTM before and afters, transition timelines, etc...but every sub I went to was absolutely DOMINATED by TIMs. Thigh high socks, shitty winged eyeliner. ""Happy gay noises."" Hours of scrolling on r/traa would produce maybe one or two self-deprecating memes relating to the experience of TIFs. It made me feel so alone. And I'd seen posts by other TIFs that complained about the same issue. Weren't we so close to realizing the truth? If only I'd thought about it more critically. Then maybe I would've left the cult sooner.

But even now, understanding that I will never be a man, and indeed am a homosexual female, there's still no escape from TIMs. When I realized I was a lesbian, I naturally flocked to the lesbian subs. But of course, the lesbian subs...contained little to no lesbians. Filled with self-proclaimed ""transbians"" and WLW libfems who are somehow okay with it. Even more infuriating, I'll see comments on posts that are not LGBT-related. Comments that say something like: ""I didn't think I could get any gayer,"" or ""As a lesbian,"" or even ""As a woman."" You know how they have Gaydar? I have TIM-dar. Because I check the post history of these commenters, and they are ALWAYS active on r/traa or some other trans sub. 
 
This can be explained simply with the fact that reddit is just generally male-dominated. But it still pisses me off.

cuei9i,cuei9i,"No, TRAs, rainbows are not all about you, and you are not more important than pregnancy/infant loss (CW)","Okay, for those that don't know- ""rainbow baby"" is a term many women have for the baby they give birth to after pregnancy loss or stillbirth. ""After the storm, we had a rainbow."" There's now even some etsy type enterprises that make baby clothes with rainbow themes to help mothers celebrate. I am on the fence about this money making approach, but I myself bought rainbow themed baby shoes.

I was lurking on Facebook on such an ad, and the thread was full of mothers sharing their stories of their losses, their rainbow babies, or mourning the rainbow babies that never came after the storms of miscarriage. Overall, this was mothers supoorting each other through pain that is UNIQUE to women. (Obviously non-mothers can mourn the loss, but they don't have the compounded physical pain and sense of betrayal from their own bodies the way we do). 

Guess who has to fucking show up? A TRA invaded the comments with a butthurt little post: ""These stories are beautiful and everything, but I was excited to see something for LGBTQIA parenting."" 

This person did not get the support he or she hoped for. Someone simply asked wtf the QIA stood for, and someone answered. Then, stony silence. I didn't want to derail the thread, since we mothers of losses don't get to share our stories with willing listeners very often. Seriously, lgbTQIA people, you have plenty of things marketed to you. You can certainly start your own businesses if you feel underrepresented. That's the beauty of Etsy. 

But don't be butthurt when something isn't about you. You know who gets spoken about in hushed whispers? Who doesn't get parades and flags? Loss mothers. People don't like to bring up our losses. It's understandable. We often can't bear to hear each other's. But we have one little corner of recovery tools and symbolism. Our symbolism is not about identity.

cnaz26,cnaz26,"What sex positivity and hookup culture did to me, and why I'm renouncing liberal feminism","I'm 18 years old, and this means that I've grown up in sex positivity and hookup culture. I've been bombarded with anti-slut shaming messages and encouragement to participate in sex positvity, and yeah, in some ways that is good. Women should not have to feel ashamed for participating in sexual activities. But, at the same time, peddling these ideas of sexual liberation to a 10 year old can be a little bit dangerous, and it was. A trigger warning for CSA.

From the time I was 11 years old, I considered myself a ""proud slut."" Previously having been molested, experiencing the death of my father, and being emotionally abused by a male father figure had left me in a strange and abandoned state of mind. I was only a child, but to feel better, I opened myself up to the sexual attention of men, GROWN men, pedophiles, on the internet. I was 11 years old, and I was allowing men older than my parents in many cases to view my body for their pleasure. Hundreds of them. We commonly participated in daddy kink, among other things. I didn't stop until I was 16. In the meantime, I met a boy only a few years older than me (coming from the same place I met those pedophiles) and we began to date, from early 15 until late 16, nearly 2 years. He encouraged me to keep talking to these men, and used it for his own monetary gain. Pimped me out, essentially. Throughout all this time, I reassured myself this was okay, this was normal, there was nothing wrong with this. How DARE you slut shame me. How DARE you kink shame me. Liberal feminism fed to me that there was nothing wrong with any kink or sexuality, and now as an adult I have Borderline Personality Disorder.

Of course my disorder isn't entirely because of these events, my trauma before age 11 has a part, but I identify it as a main factor. I feel dirty, used up, gross every day. I hate myself and I hate everything I did, I hate that I allowed those disgusting men to use me like that and I hate that I thought it was okay. I want any liberal, kink-positive, sex-positive feminist that reads this to know that your ideology allowed a child to be groomed and taken advantage of.

c02vu7,c02vu7,the “transwomen experience parts of womanhood that ciswomen will never understand” argument,"About 3 months ago I peak transed after many years of suspicion and unease through contrapoints’s video on “gender critical” (ugh) of all things. 

My best friend of 6 years at the time, who I talked to literally everyday, blocked me, called me a hateful terf, told me to “save it for reddit because I am not the one,” and that I’m naive and disgusting because I tentatively said that it’s misogynist for contrapoints to mock women like Germaine Greer and Sylvia Plath. That aggressive and clearly cult-like reaction from her spurred me into seeking out more critiques from women on the trans issue, and I found this subreddit! It’s been very educational and I feel a lot of solidarity here. As radicals, we talk actual fucking sense, whereas liberals are talking absolute gibberish. Personally, I think they’re mostly aware in their heart of hearts that it’s all fantasy, but the quest for male validation is a powerful drug I guess. 

Anyway, something my former best friend said to me during our final blowout was this line I always hear from the TRAs, and honestly, was one of the big red flags for me when I was indoctrinated in the transcult. It’s: “transwomen experience parts of womanhood that CIS women will NEVER understand!” And of course they never say what those things are? Like, what are they experiencing? Being a man? ??? Is that the part of womanhood that we subordinate women will never understand?? Lol?? What the fuck.

This is such a cult tactic, I find it really concerning that most people don’t publicly challenge it when it’s said. It absolutely is a 1984-esque attack on language so as to separate us as an oppressed sex class. How are we supposed to have discussion when even in situations like the one I described with my female friend, a private conversation between two females, men’s ideologies are infiltrating our ability to have intellectual conversation? 

The only hard explanation I’ve heard in support of that statement is that “transwomen experience dysphoria whereas cis women do not.” And???!!?!?? Do people actually fucking believe that??? How many women do we all know who will not leave their homes without painting over their faces, without deprecatingly calling themselves fat in their heads or otherwise, who are extremely self aware of their bodies in public??? That’s why Margaret atwood’s statement about male fantasies rings so universally true for all the women who read it!!! We are our own voyeurs! 

How is women mutilating their bodies with cosmetic breast enlargement procedures, rhinoplasty, lip injections, face lifts, etc. not also considered gender based dysphoria? Isn’t it? Getting unnecessary dangerous surgeries based on image insecurities? Should these procedures be prescribed by therapists to women who disclose that they’re insecure about their self confidence and body image? Should these procedures therefore be covered by health insurance? Like! What the fuck! Of course that would be absolutely crazy to validate a person’s low self esteem by encouraging them to surgically alter their body rather than give them actual therapy to accept themselves how they are.

What are some absolutely absurd things you’ve been told by a libfem when confronted with gender critical ideas? I find they mostly just get very angry very fast and resort to personal attacks rather than justify their argument. Has anyone else heard this thing about transwomen knowing womanhood more than actual women do?

aponr5,aponr5,"The boy who tried to rape me in high school identifies as a woman now, and everything about it is killing me.","I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm not a regular participant in trans discourse. I have my thoughts about the superficial nature of adopted femininity then and again, but I also generally believe, or at least *want* to believe, in the right to identify and present according to your personal preferences. I originally posted an incredibly bare-bones version of this in r//trueoffmychest, but had been contacted by a kind stranger who suggested I post here instead. I'm using a throwaway, because I really wanted to pour my heart out on here-- and this has gotten to be a long, long post. So, with apologies, here goes--

When I was about 11, I was sent to live with relatives overseas. It was an incredibly abusive (physical, verbal, emotional) environment-- and long-term abuse like that really robs you of your childhood. My foray into adolescence was fraught with discomfort and depression and loneliness. The trauma of it is something I'll have to deal with forever-- but amidst all of this terribleness, I developed a proper crush on a boy in my class. It meant everything to me.

Dear reader, not to sound dramatic or twelve or like an incredibly dramatic twelve-year-old, but it was the only bit of happiness in my life for a while. I didn't know him or talk to him, even in passing, but I was almost desperately in love with the idea that I could love someone. I held onto those feelings of tenderness like a lifeline-- I'd missed being loved for so long, and this was the next best thing, though I knew it could never lead anywhere substantial. It didn't have to.

Even after my circumstances changed, and I'd moved away from that abusive environment, I held onto that crush. For sentimentality's sake, maybe. Or maybe because I'd just grown used to loving this person (or the idea of loving them, or anyone) from afar-- I held onto it all the way into high school. I was an extremely high achieving student, academically *and* extra-curricularly. I had friends. I headed clubs. This crush situation was the only ""weird"" thing about me. I was a massive flirt, and would go on dates then and again, but I'd always thought to myself that it'd be one of those back of the mind things I'd never really be over 'till like, university.

And you have to understand-- though I grew up, the nature of this ""crush"" never changed. It remained girlish and naive. There was never anything sexual about it, even if I'd realized what it was to be sexually attracted to people, and absolutely was. It was like this lovely bit of my childhood-- one I wasn't allowed to properly have, that I could hold onto, secretly, privately. I swear to god, this'll all be at least tangentially relevant.

Anyway. High school was when I met... shall we call him A? He was an odd sort of person who was best friends with a good friend of mine. We eventually settled into the same friend group. He confessed to me early on that he thought me incredibly ""exotic"", which should've been a massive red flag as is, and then went on to also admit that he'd fantasized about me, who was loud and outspoken in contrast to his incredibly introverted, awkward personality, sexually dominating him. If all of this wasn't incredibly inappropriate already, he was a staunch atheist who'd taken it upon himself to criticize my culturally Islamic background at any chance-- for our high school poetry project, he wrote about wanting to free some otherwise smart, ""exotic"" girl from the shackles of dogma. Holy shit.

I knew he was interested in me romantically-- but the poem incident propelled me into making it very clear that it was never going to happen. I'd felt very infantilized. Very exploited, somehow. It was over. It'd been the last straw over everything else.

This, of course, is where things begin to sour. Our shared friend group knew of my little crush situation. Not the (honestly, kind of sad) psychological nonsense behind it, but that I'd had an incredibly soft spot for him. They knew I'd had it for a while-- and A knew him from band practice.

That weekend, when they'd gone off to music camp, A decided to write up an incredibly explicit, disgustingly fetishistic, self-insert story from *my* point of view, *involving* this longtime crush situation, and passed it around through group chats and such, claiming that *I* wrote it up on our friends' gc, drunk and truthful. He wrote *fanfiction*, literally, just to get back at me. I wish I could laugh about it now. There's something darkly humorous about the insanity of it, but it killed me at the time. I felt incredibly violated-- like someone had robbed me of something very precious. Those childish feelings, that'd kept me alive, even, at a terrible time in my life, felt desecrated. I was livid.

The smart thing to do would've been to let it go and never acknowledge it, but I confronted A about it on a Friday afternoon--the Friday afternoon before term holidays. The schoolyard had been empty. I'd started off calm and poised and ready for an apology, but it'd escalated to yelling and swearing. I was somehow in his face, though he was a good foot taller, and he'd pushed me, *hard*.

I remember staggering back, and looking up at him in disbelief, and *freezing*. You know that look, where you can just tell that someone really, *truly* hates you? Wants to *hurt* you? He had *that* kind of look on his face. It was disorienting. He'd stepped forward and pushed me again and I fell this time-- and all of a sudden the situation felt terrifying and unreal and I remember him on top of me trying to undo my blouse and my tie, and he was calling me a bitch/cunt/whore *whateve*r, and I was crying, and he'd had one hand holding me down by the shoulder and I was kicking, and I was kicking and I was kicking 'till I'd finally gotten him off, and I *ran*.

I know what he wanted to do then-- and the horror of it has never quite settled in. This was the schoolyard where I'd hung out with my friends. This was the schoolyard where I'd had my first kiss. This was where I sang and laughed and made pancakes for fundraisers. This was *safe*. It'd been too much to process at the time. I remember running 'till I'd somehow ended up in the 4th-floor girls' bathroom, and sitting on the toilet 'till the sun was close to setting and then just... getting up before dark, fixing my shirt and my hair and my tie, going back to the yard, picking up my bag, and walking home. I've never spoken of this to anyone 'till today. I don't know why.

This happened when I was 16, and I'm turning 19 this year-- and all I've ever felt in all this time, when I've actually managed to feel anything about what'd happened, was *rage*. I wanted to hurt him so badly. To drown him in the school pool. Gut him like a fish-- but it'd been a vague and disjointed kind of rage. It's hard to explain. It felt misplaced, like I didn't know what I was so angry about. I'd repressed it so well. So fucking well. Sometimes it felt like a dream. Sometimes it felt like I'd made it all up in my head.

Maybe it's lucky for him, but a month or so after the incident, I'd become violently ill with a bout of severe pneumonia. It'd been concerning. It left me bedridden for weeks on end, and knocked me out of school for months. I felt incredibly guilty about it-- it'd screwed up my credits. I wouldn't be graduating. I can look back on it now and think of it as just some other obstacle (law school happened for me!) but at the time, I felt like I'd rather *die* than let my classmates know what'd become of me. They knew me as this bright, successful person, and I'd rathered they only *ever* know me as that. I consciously cut off contact from everyone, and it wasn't till yesterday when an old friend dug up my number from somewhere and called me, that I'd talked to any of them. That's when I found out about A.

A was a woman now. He was a she now. She was out there-- a full alcoholic, apparently-- in full makeup and skirt and high heel combination. She was posting about #metoo and #girlproblems. She was a bona fide woman with access to bona fide woman places, like female restrooms, where I ran from her once.

I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I cried. The injustice of it was suffocating at first. I remembered what he'd said to me that day; *stupid bitch, worthless cunt, filthy whore*. I remembered the specifically gendered violence of it. I thought of him, lanky and tall and so easily able to overpower me despite how weak he seemed. and all of his fantasies. I thought of what he wanted to do to me, and how he could only do it because of how I was female, and he was male, and I cried.

I wondered if I was the only one. The disturbing phenomenon of transwomen on social media threatening to enact specifically gendered violence towards cis women they politically disagree with has not been lost on me. I wanted, more than anything, to be understood-- I wasn't a bad person. I was just conflicted. I wasn't going to pour my life story on there, so all managed to say on tumblr was--

\>Men who have enacted or have actively threatened to enact specifically gendered violence towards women… should never be allowed to identify as a woman. I feel as though prior violence towards women is ultimately indicative of any prospective feminine gender identity stemming from a place of autogynephilic fetishism instead of actual dysphoria– it doesn’t compute otherwise for any person to identify so keenly w womanhood and its complexities and *still* speak so freely of wanting to rape/murder us. Violent misogynists shouldn't be allowed to co-opt the oppression they themselves perpetuated. There’s no hope.<

The terf outcry was *instant*. I've gotten rape threats. I've gotten death threats. I think that's what ultimately is so distressing to me-- that people are generally a lot more keen to defend and harass me over her right to be a woman than they are to sympathize with me. I'm so viscerally upset about all of this... it's just not fair. It's not fair. I don't know what I'll do if I see her in a bathroom. Will I snap? Will I break down? Am I ever going to find peace about this?

Am I wrong? Am I genuinely being problematic? Does it even matter?

If you've read so far, your patience is commendable. Thank you for being part of this catharsis-- even if this is lost in Sorted By New, knowing that *someone* will have heard my story is of some comfort.

EDIT: I cannot thank you enough for your support, (and you, kind stranger, for the gold.) The initial backlash left me lost and confused. It'd hurt my heart. Even after a couple days, I can't really use Tumblr without feeling a bit anxious-- which is so stupid, right? Anxious because of whom? Some 22 year old agender furry who told me to suck their pee out of their jorts?

(A completely real ask I've received from a completely real person, btw.)

The world feels insane, but I know I'm not wrong-- or even a remotely bad person. It's not transphobic to feel upset about a sex offender being allowed unlimited access to young women, or to want for that access to be revoked. I will stand firm in my convictions, and I refuse to be sorry.   


2ND EDIT: A prominent news source has contacted me about this story, asking if I would be open to sharing it through their publication anonymously. The commonality of this experience was harrowing to discover, and I've decided to give it a shot-- the way you all made me feel less alone meant so much to me, after all, and if I could do that for someone in my shoes, it'd mean just as much.

I\'m so viscerally upset about all of this... it\'s just not fair.\n\nI guess I\'m WAY more jaded at this point because to me, that\'s just how groups of men are and it\'s no longer really distressing to me, because I expect it.

Contact RAINN to help you connect with resources in your area. Even if you don't have insurance, there might be free options. \n\nAlso, fuck Tumblr. Honestly, social media is a mess. This is a good sub. It can alleviate some of your doubts. However, for trans issues, trying to debate TRAs from a gender critical standpoint is like screaming into the void.

It was something very precious to you and it was desecrated. *That's why he did it.* He didn't think it was 'no big deal' to you. He knew how important it was to you and how much it would hurt to use it to humilate you. It's not a silly girly feeling or anything like that. He deliberately set out to hurt you, thought about the best way to do that, and suceeded. Don't take any responsibility for that onto yourself.  \n\n\nAnd good on you for confronting him. I am so proud of younger you for standing up for herself! She knew what she deserved was an apology and to be treated with respect. Fuck yes! AND then fighting off this guy. You're rad! The rage is GOOD! What he did was wrong and he deserves to be punished for it. For thinking he has any right to you. For treating you like you don't matter as a person. For all of it.

Bender is a mediocre level bender who realizes he could never compete with the male robot athletes without actual hardwork so he transitions to female and easily wins the robot Olympics

he ends becoming a ""female"" rolemodel and acts a like misogynistic caricature of what his idea of a perfect woman is

one line I cannot forget was ""Men are so much better at being women"" spoken by Bender to Leela and Amy when they were calling him out

c76uxz,c76uxz,Just an idea. Remind them what consent is.,"Instead of saying ""I don't want to have sex with trans women/anyone with a penis,"" (which, alone, you'd think would be enough of a respectable boundary, but apparently not) we explicitly say;
 ""I do not consent to sex with trans women/anyone with a penis."" 

I feel like bringing the word ""consent"" into our arguments and responses more often will hopefully hit them with a dose of reality for once, and make them realize they sound like rapists. If they can't accept that answer, if they want to say our lack of consent is bigoted, they are a tried and true rapist. Nothing more.

Confirmed before or after birth, and 2. Appear to have the purpose, etc... It sounds like they\'re just trying to define female as those born and recognized as female. I would remove the part about the receiving sperm, because it isn\'t needed, and the part about \'individual with ovaries\' as that wouldn\'t always be accurate.

As females, we are assumed (whether we want to or not, or have had a hysterectomy or some other health issue) to be the sex that can get impregnanted by the male sex. If TRAs want to deconstruct everything, including chromosomes, and use exceptions as a gotcha then trying to define the sex classes in a broader stroke is understandable. Sure, it is gross to be defined as impregnable by penis, but that's the foundation of our sex class and oppression, really. It doesn't sound like they're awaiting a woman's actual pregnancy to validate the definition. It is a class issue. \n\nIs it good or feminist? No, probably not.

To this, the answer is the same: women were born with female reproductive organs. Even if they remove them or if the organs have a few issues, they are still women.\n\nFor example, if a woman happens to be born without an uterus, this is an anomaly. But she is still a woman because her chromossomes are XX and under normal circumstances they would have made her body develop an uterus."", ""Holy shit ya'll. These comments...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis bill defines women by biological realities. It does not mention a woman's 'ability' to procreate. This article is written on THE DAILY DOT by a probable TIM, or at least a TRA. This bill would help keep biological women as a protected class. This bill isn't sexist. If you're a GC/rad-fem you should be in *favor* of this bill. The bill would stop men from competing in *women's* sports, stop men from getting access to women's locker rooms, rape shelters, etc because this bill defines women by our ***biology,*** not by a 'feeling' or femininity. A man couldn't say he was a woman and then get to BE a woman."", 'I would like to just point out that this is biologically accurate and how biologists classify species (the one that produces larger gametes = female, and smaller gametes = male) and remind that acknowledging one is designed for one role *in reproduction*, does not *obligate* or mean that either sex\'s role in a society is to do *only* that. This does not reduce women to ""you must bear children; it is your role"" any more than it reduces a female meerkat to ""you must bear pups""; as in highly social, large animal societies (like meerkats, bees, mole rats, etc), especially those that are [eusocia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality)l, there are more roles and jobs to fill besides just reproduction. Very often in these large societal species, only a handful reproduce (interestingly these large societies are often the ones to practice polyandry--as in, one female has many ""husbands""--despite its otherwise relative scarcity in contrast to polygamy, polygyny, and monogamy) while other females are not designated as ""breeders""; they are other things, more than just the sexual organs that would *allow* them to be a breeder. The other females and males who are not utilizing their biological sex are put to other roles to support the society and future offspring of the breeders. As in, women are free to be mothers, have a career, or whatever depending on where they fall into the societal system/what they want to do, but only females *can* fulfill the reproductive role of producing larger gametes (or, in mammals, gestating offspring; being a mother).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short: this says the biology of being female is that she has the biological structures suggesting she can get pregnant, and lacks the biological parts that would allow her to impregnate. It does not obligate the female to get pregnant or erase her other human parts that allow her to take other jobs/roles in a large society, anymore than it obligates a male to impregnate females.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Sidenote because I find it really cool: these types of large scale societies that are often polyandrous are also associated with producing [vocal language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zSWiuuCnE) and [architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/576516.Animal_Architects) such as bee hives, termite mounds, prairie dog tunnels, etc.', 'Biologist and homosexual woman (as in adult human female)  here.I really do not see the ""reducing women to their parts"" problem with the Uta bill definition.I repeat,I do not see how it reduces females to their parts.What it does is define the main traits of the female that is different from the male.(I wonder if there any men complaining about the definition of male. My guess is not).The definition is valid for both the menopausal women and the ones who lets say lost their parts to disease or trauma,because at birth or before birth they were observed of having those traits.I believe it covers even the ones who were born without a uterus or a vagina as long as they were born with ovaries.\n\nPS I l also do not see the problem with ""receiving sperm from a male donor"" even though I would rather dive in a volcano that touch a penis.This is the way we humans  reproduce.', 'Take note, TRAs: THIS is what reducing women to their body parts means. \n\nThe conservatives are defining ""a woman"" in relation to whether they can become pregnant.

blzjhj,blzjhj,I’m that girl from the trans partner sub,"Hi, I feel a bit nervous posting here but I’ve gotten so many kind messages that I thought I’d take the leap. An introduction seems odd as my post has become popular here. I feel like in a way you already know me. I’m sorry if I haven’t replied to all your messages yet, the amount of response has been quite overwhelming and I’ve had a lot to think about. For honesty’s sake I’ve also posted a version of this (not that different tbf) on the trans partner’s sub, just because I went there first and people have been wondering if I’ve jumped into the Thames yet. Also for clarity’s sake I put that flair on the last post in a bit of a hysterical fit. It wasn’t the sub. 

I feel like I know the basis of GC theory but then coming to a GC sub makes me believe I probably know nothing at all. I thought I should actually make an effort as I’ve been invited here before I make any form of judgement. I scrolled through and I want to respect your use of language so I’ll be calling my trans-partner they/them but you can obviously reply however you want. 

In my other post I was on edge and I poured everything out quite frantically and if I’m honest, without thought. It was an explosion of feeling. A lot of problems in our relationship I internalised and blamed myself for. I’ve known my partner for six years and we’ve been through a lot. They’ve always been there for me. Friends for three first, then dating for three, and it’s in this last year they came out to me. We’ve had our squabbles but when they were a boy, he never ever did anything to hurt me so I thought- it must be me. It’s my fault that their doing things that make me uncomfortable. I thought I wasn’t being enough. I’m bi, so I’ve dipped into the LGBT community a bit. When they came out I wanted so hard to be a good *ally* and the best supportive *girlfriend.* This was about their experiences and their pain and them moving forward. I didn’t think my feelings were valid because of this. I was scared that if I couldn’t hack it I would be labelled a bad person and an even worse ally.

There were a lot of things about our relationship that I left out because I know it doesn’t make them look good and I thought “well if you take it out of context, if you don’t factor in their dysphoria and their depression *of course* it looks like their treating me badly but I love them and it’s not like that.” It actually took the last post to make me realise that their behaviour is toxic and although it’s so painful to admit that someone you love is doing this, that they are abusing me. 

I’m exhausted and I’m at the end of my rope. Something happened yesterday and I don’t know how to feel about it. I’m definitely going to break up with them but I would like some advice on how. Do I tell them why? I would want to know why but it’s hard when the reasons are “now you treat me like shit.” How do I not cave if they pull a “life has no meaning without you I’ll kill myself” on me? Can we still be friends? What if I don’t want that? 

I want to start off with the positives because it hasn’t been all bad and this is from my point of view- there are probably tons of things I’ve fucked up on. I genuinely enjoyed having my best friend become my best *girl* friend. I’m handy on the sewing machine and I can make us matching outfits which is very fun. I feel knowledgable showing someone how to plait/which shampoo to buy/how to make quick, easy meals/ what colours go well with her ect ect. We watch shit, really sexist, “the bachelor” like programs whilst before he would laugh at me now we can guiltily enjoy them together. We go to drag nights now so they can properly get all dressed up in public, people automatically use her pronouns and no one bats on eye. It’s had its moments.

I started feeling uncomfortable and our relationship began to disintegrate in little bits. I have light brown, tanned skin and my parents come from a small island but I was born and raised in London. Apart from being eroticised by weird men, (Can I see your magic carpet Jasmine? Yeah I know) I’ve been lucky enough to never encounter any form of racism and being an interracial couple has never even come up. I make the finest curries and every now and again I’ll take him to an Indian wedding were we’ll dance the night away to different music- but apart from that, nothing. When he was my boyfriend, sometimes he would say that I have a lovely skin tone, I looked glowy in the sun, a colour looked great on me- which is nice. They’re totally acceptable things to say. Now we’d be in the middle of sex and they would start stroking my arms and call me “caramel” and “good enough to eat.” I paused and gave them a bit of an amused look- like what? The next day over breakfast I told them it made me deeply uncomfortable and they apologised. But then during sex they did it again. I was their “little dessert” and “honey” and their “little doll.” I waited until after but I told them to cut it out and they said that lesbians are good at waxing poetic and before, his compliments in and out of the bedroom weren’t more creative than “god you’re so hot.” I felt for them, and I thought they was just trying something new and it wasn’t a big deal. I honestly thought this is probably more of a white people thing then my trans girlfriend exploring her womanhood thing and that when they figured out their language better it would stop. I convinced myself that I shouldn’t make a big deal out of it and upset them so I let it go. 

This brings me to sex. It’s different than before which I really don’t mind. It’s much softer and slower, less rough and I was really into it. I go on top mostly to help with the dysphoria and that’s totally fine. But then they asked me if they could cum on my face which really took me by surprise. When they were a boy they never requested anything like that. In the moment I was kind of shocked but my initial reaction was to say yes. I may be a people pleaser but I’m not in my Uni days anymore and I don’t let guys do that sort of thing to me anymore. I saw it as definitively porny and if I’m honest, very *masculine.* But this was my Trans girlfriend. The last thing I wanted to do was accuse them of being masculine. I remember them going to shower and I just sat there, with a towel in my hand and cum in my hair and I felt... empty. And sort of used. They wanted to finish on my breasts or my face each time now we had sex and I didn’t really have the heart to tell them no. After a while, I asked them if we could please stop and, I probably shouldn’t have said this, but that it reminded me of what sex with teenage boys was like. I have a bad habit of putting my foot in my mouth. We had a huge argument. I can’t remember how it spiralled but they started saying how I was invalidating them- invalidate is a bit of a buzz word in the community and I knew that was the height of bad so I felt like shit and confused. 

I’ve been doing their make up, helping them build the courage to come out to their parents, I’ve been calling them girly pet names, always being there when they needs a cry, I get them out of bed on bad days and make sure they go to work- I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying the hardest I can and it still wasn’t enough and I was still doing it wrong. 

That’s when I started going incredibly deep into trans subreddits rather than just having a browse. It’s also when I read things that, if I’m honest, offended me and I thought were misogynistic. This is already too long so I won’t go into it. But it painted my partner in a better light. I thought, they’ve always listened to me and cared about my plight as a woman. They’re one of the “good ones.” The more I read the more I was convinced I should put their pain above mine and the more I secretly, deep down inside, questioned their behaviour the more I hated myself and thought myself to be bigoted, not progressive and wrong. 

I became so aware of my cis privilege without really knowing what it entailed. I just knew that my very being- my body, my periods, my dress, my femininity was something that came easy to me and that made me lucky. I didn’t feel lucky I’ll be honest. Life as a woman, as you all can probably relate, is a daily struggle. Just growing up in an unjust world is a difficult thing to learn and it’s a lesson you understand pretty early on.

Before when I got cat-called my boyfriend got really protective and would pull me closer and I really liked that. One time in particular on our anniversary some guy yelled “she’s a beauty your lucky mate” and he yelled back “I know I don’t deserve her” and it just made my year. They’re not at all that nice, but that particular time he looked at me like I was his everything and it meant so much. Now getting cat-called is a disaster in the works. They’re not on hormones and they have a very stereotypical masculine body and face so for now they dress more androgynous then traditionally feminine- the NHS need you to be of a certain stability with your mental health before they allow you to take hormones and my partner’s depression makes it difficult. Anyway, when I get harassed it puts them in a dangerously bad mood. I feel like I have to tiptoe around them and coax them out of it. But if it happens more than once when we’re out there’s no saving the evening. I tried to talk to them about it but they refuses to talk to me saying “I wouldn’t understand.” It makes them get quite possessive, which honestly frightens me a little. They would hold me and tell me that I’m “just for them.” They’re convinced I’m going to leave them for someone else and I keep having to convince them that I’m *here* with *them* and I wouldn’t. 

Now, when I’ve tried to break up with them they makes it about me ditching them for some other man and not our genuine relationship issues. It’s because of that and their dysphoria that, like I mentioned in my previous post, I tried to dress more masculine. Hoodies and leggings just made me look younger and I attracted more old men who probably thought I was a schoolgirl or something. So I stopped. I kept trying to find ways to stifle my femininity but, and I think me and my partner can both agree on this, changing yourself is exhausting. 

Yesterday is when things got more than I could handle. I know I want to break up with them, but I don’t know how to do it so I’ve been mulling it over. They was fresh out the shower and told me that they had an idea for sex and if I wanted to try it. Out of all the things they could have said, that really surprised me. The last two months and a bit our sex life has been appalling. They were so excited that it made me feel excited. I know it’s stupid but I thought maybe all our issues could be solved magically through sex. This was a very bad idea, especially as I was planning to break up with them. This one I’ll admit is all on me and my very stupid decisions. They wanted to be on top which was a change, and started to slowly grind. It was good. They went on like this for a while and I thought this was the goal, the new idea, but then they slipped it in. It *hurt*. I’ve always been tight and I always tell my partners they better make sure I’m very wet before penetration- usually fingering or they eat me out. They didn’t do any of that. They thrust themselves in and I was just frozen. I panicked and started tussling . I pushed against their chest and their shoulders, trying to get them off of me or just give me some space- I wasn’t thinking clearly, but I couldn’t get them to budge. They started petting my hair and hushing me like I was some sort of distressed child but I did calm down. I wasn’t as tense and had probably stretched to accommodate as it didn’t really hurt anymore. I remember just staring at each other, their fingers combing through my hair and I was trying to take deep breaths. They asked me if this was okay. I can’t express how utterly confused I felt. I didn’t know what had just happened. I was still in a sort of frozen mind set. It was too much and I was so tried. I said yes. Please don’t question it. We’ve been together and been having sex for three years so they have a solid understanding of how my body works. It felt pleasurable physically but as I kept my hands on their shoulders, I couldn’t help but think how I couldn’t push them off. In that moment- them fresh out the shower, hair in a bun, six foot with a six pack- I didn’t see them as a woman at all. That voice inside me said that if they had been cis woman, I would have a better chance of shoving her off. I couldn’t believe what happened. I still can’t, really. I keep playing it over in my mind and I keep thinking that maybe I’m misremembering. I know I gave my consent, and they did check in with me and I didn’t actually voice the words stop or no. Maybe they misunderstood my floundering. Or misread it, or something of the sort. The problem I’m having in general with our relationship is that they’re not the person that was my best friend anymore. It’s not that my boyfriend is now my girlfriend, it’s that things keep happening that makes it harder to find the person I fell in love with. 

An hour after that happened I told them that my best friend who I’ve known since nursery was sick and I was going over there to coax her back to life for a few days. They didn’t question it, gave me a kiss goodbye and everything. I’m there now. I haven’t told my friends anything about how rocky our relationship has been because although they’ve always been a brilliant support system for me, I’m honestly ashamed of how badly my relationship has gotten. Nothing has happened the way it should have. I wanted to be a good girlfriend and ally but all that’s happened is I’m looking back at the past year and wondering how it became such a fucking mess. I told my best friend, without any context, that I’m breaking up with my partner and she said I can live with her like the sweetheart that she is. My partner will probably give me 3/5 days before they comes to pick me up and I need to work out what I’m going to do.

I’m so grateful for everyone that was kind to me. It was exactly what I needed. If I’m honest, I feel like the community doesn’t like hearing stories that don’t coincide with their own rhetoric. Most replies were really supportive and I’m thankful for that, but some called me a “TERF”’which pissed me off to no end and one person, who thankfully got removed, basically accused me of lying. It hurts. I’m looking for genuine help, not to kicked when I’m down. I thought if I genuinely was transphobic would I be trying this hard? And for someone who’s always struggled with intense self-hatred giving myself that much credit was a honest to god struggle. It’s so easy now to shut people down when they express any sort of criticism and this needs to stop. I know there are people like me who need support and help but are too scared to ask for it in their communities out of fear for the backlash- I know because they messaged me.

I’m honestly on my last legs, and looking for any form of help. Sorry this is so long, and thank you.

Edit: Hey! First from the bottom of my heart thank you. I’ve read every single response more than twice I can assure you. All this kindness has made me cry and there’s actual, tangible, good advice here. I just want you know I’m not ignoring you, and I want to reply to every post but everything’s a bit much at the moment. I still can’t get over what happened yesterday.

Changing these things is either difficult or impossible.\n* You're with someone who doesn't have your back in difficult situations, like cat-calling.\n* You're with someone who blurs the lines of consent, which should always be happily and enthusiastically given and easily revoked.\n* You're with someone whose moods are beyond your ability to support and handle.\n* You're with someone who hints at suicide if you leave, which is a naked threat.\n\nThis relationship isn't good for you. I'd argue that it isn't good for your partner either, since things you can't control are devastating for them. Don't let anyone-- least of all yourself-- convince you that you're wrong for leaving. Good luck, and I'm rooting for you!"", 'On the topic of you supposedly not being the perfect girlfriend: No one is. If your partner were a good “girlfriend” in turn, any mistakes you’ve made should be forgiven. If that’s not happening, that’s your partner’s problem, not yours. If you were really so awful, then it’s your partner’s responsibility to break up with you. That *that* hasn’t happened makes it pretty clear that you have been a good girlfriend.\n\nOn the topic of how to handle the breakup: The suicide threats have a strong correlation with later murder-suicide when the non-suicidal partner leaves. It’s not guaranteed, lots of abusers make that threat and don’t act on it at all, but you still should be careful. My suggestion is that you start planning to get out now.\n\nIf you two live together, work out a new living situation that your partner won’t know about. Move in to the new space as quickly as possible without your partner knowing about it. If you don’t have a lot of time, take the necessities and anything you’d be heartbroken to lose, family mementos and pets for example, abusers often destroy keepsakes and kill pets for revenge. Make no mistake, threatening suicide to get you to stay is abusive, and, even if this doesn’t end in violence against you, it’s guaranteed that some sort of revenge will come into play.\n\nIf you don’t live together, you still might want to move so you can’t be easily found.\n\nOnce you’re safe, send an email or text to break up. It’s harsh but this could literally be a life or death situation. Don’t respond to appeals to “talk” things over and don’t answer the phone unless you recognize the number. Abusers will call a hundred times in a row with the hope that you’ll pick up on the 101st ring. The cleaner the cut, the harder it’ll be to embroil you in a long, drawn-out breakup that could end in violence.', ""I read your post a few days ago, and it really broke my heart. Reading this now, I think you definitely have your head on straight. It's clear how much you love your partner, but it seems like the bottom line is that they are not actively loving you back.

You deserve so much better and you shouldn't sacrifice your own well being for theirs, no matter what they're dealing with. \n\nI also kind of wonder if in transitioning, your partner has thought that they don't have to care for you in the ways they did before because they're no longer a man, which is it course very sexist and unfounded.\n\nI'm so sorry you're having to deal with this, and I wish you all the luck in making your life better.

It's generally not a good idea, but when you're dealing with a toxic person it just won't go well. He's not in a place to be able to listen to you, and he will be just twist everything you say. \n\nDo all of the preparations you need to do (like finding a new place if you're living together) and break it off quickly, and completely. Tell him not to contact you, and block him on everything. Tell him to contact a friend of yours if there's some emergency where he had to get in contact with you. \n\nIt may sound extreme, or mean, but it's really crucial to get him completely out of your life for your own emotional and mental well-being.\n\nBest of luck!

If someone threatens suicide assume they are serious. In the US, that’d be calling 911 and getting emergency services. This works in two ways. One, if someone is actually suicidal it gets them immediate help and prevents a tragedy. This is a situation that you will need a lot of help to handle. And second, if they are manipulative it calls them out on their shit and takes the power they hold over you. It tells them you will not bend to their will and they can’t play that card. Either way you’re covered and you’ve done your due diligence to help them.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, it’s my first ever! \n\nI want to add that a conditional suicide is most likely manipulation.

Second, because he Will try to weaponize the ending of your relationship against you by claiming that you are “transphobic” if you bring the trans thing up at all.

He\'s been manipulating you for his selfish pleasure, during sex and just during other daily interactions. Parading around in drag, expecting you to not notice his personality changes as he play-acts being a woman, is an insult to you and every other woman who has ever walked on this earth and feared  what the other 50% of the population (men) could potentially do to harm them.

You are not going to lose all your friends or have people change their minds about who you are because you decide to break up with your trans partner.

Your partner has their life to live and you have yours, and you don\'t cave by saying, ""no one wants you to hurt or kill yourself, especially me.

You already have a history of saying yes to him when you don\'t want to (no judgement, it happens to abuse victims) so if you give him the opportunity to argue with you about the breakup you might find it doesn\'t stick. Have a line, just one line, something like ""this isn\'t working for me any more"" and give him a variation on that every time he asks for a reason or accuses you of transphobia or of cheating on him or whatever, and exit the conversation as quickly as you can.\n\nIt might be worth your while recording the breakup conversation so you can listen to it again if you find yourself forgetting how awful everything was and wondering if you should give him another chance.  Also, frankly, so you can use it as evidence in case he stalks you. He sounds quite dangerous and breakups are when abusers escalate.\n\nIf he threatens suicide, offer to dial 999.\n\nAlso, read ""Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Controlling and Angry Men"" by  Lundy Bancroft. Gender identity or no gender identity, I think you\'ll find it rings a lot of bells. It\'s a book that has helped a lot of women who are being abused by their partners.', 'Dump him. It’s ok.', 'Hey, I’m really glad you came to this subreddit!\n\nAs someone who was in a really abusive psuedo-relationship when I was much younger, I’m noticing a lot of similarities between your thinking and mine when I first started realizing he was abusive - trying to rationalize all the shitty, abusive things he’s doing, minimizing your own gut feelings about the situation, and reminding yourself about happy moments from before things got really bad.  \n\nIt really sounds like your partner ignored your own boundaries and gaslit you any time you tried to say you weren’t comfortable with something, like cumming on your face, and calling you weird racist pet names.  I’m not trying to make you feel worse, but the recent sexual encounter you described was rape.  You tried to push him off, he completely ignored you and kept trying to have sex.\n\nWhen you’re constantly told that your own feelings and views are wrong, you start to doubt yourself and stop listening to your instincts.  It takes time but you will start to feel more and more sure about the decision to leave him.\n\nYou don’t owe this guy an explanation or anything.  If he threatens suicide, block his number and don’t respond.  \n\nSomething I noticed while reading your post is that even when describing things that you liked about him, they were still things that you did *for him* (like sewing clothes) or minor things like him complimenting you. or even misogynistic stuff like him participating in cat calling you (wtf?).  Can you think of a single time he actually put effort into doing something nice for you, like cooking for you, or buying/making you a thoughtful gift?\n\nI’m glad you’re safe at your friends house and that she sounds supportive.  Whenever you’re ready, I think you should tell your friend about all the terrible things your partner told you - there’s been plenty of times I’ve told a female friend about weird red flags in a guy I was dating, where I had doubts but I still tried to justify his shitty selfish behavior, and talking it out with girlfriends helped me realize that I was rationalizing it.  And of course I’ve done this whenever a friend has come to me for advice.  It’s a recurring thing that I’ve noticed - women are safer when they talk to each other about this stuff!\n\nIt sucks, but since being in that abusive situation when I was younger I’ve got a list of red flags that I look out for - any behavior that’s controlling or dismissive of my feelings and boundaries is a MASSIVE red flag for me now. \n\nPlease don’t blame yourself for any of this.  It’s not a bad thing to try to see the best in people, but unfortunately men are giant shit bags.', 'Looking at your first thread on the trans partner sub, I think I\'m understanding the definition of ""TERF"" to mean ""woman who is too aware of sexism.""\n\n> This post is sort of TERF-y, but I can understand your sense of being oppressed as a woman and how you don\'t like that your girlfriend is making you feel like an object. However, this is her probably just her dysphoria and not just her being possessive. She lusts after those things not because she wants to objectify them, but to her, those convey womanhood to her, however oppressive it may actually be.\n\nThis person is literally saying it doesn\'t matter how oppressive his behavior is because he has dysphoria.', '>Do I tell them why? I would want to know why but it’s hard when the reasons are “now you treat me like shit.” How do I not cave if they pull a “life has no meaning without you I’ll kill myself” on me? Can we still be friends? What if I don’t want that?\n\nYou can tell him why. You probably should after so long. ""You\'ve been treating me like crap, I\'m unhappy, I don\'t think it\'s going to change and I\'ve had enough"" is plenty of a reason. You don\'t have to give him another chance, you\'ve already spent a lot of time in this relationship and it\'s up to you how many chances you want to give it. As for the suicide thing; Any time someone threatens to kill themselves if you leave, that\'s 100% confirmation that you *need* to leave right away. That is emotional abuse and absolute proof that the relationship isn\'t safe for either of you. Someone who will kill themselves to stop you leaving could also kill *you* to stop you leaving. Tell him to call a suicide hotline and get out. You are not a first responder. There is nothing you can do for someone else who wants to kill themselves. That\'s a job for the police/paramedics.\n\n>they said that lesbians are good at waxing poetic\n\nI think i can help you put into words what was so weird about that. He was trying to play a role. He thinks that women speak to each other this way (probably because he\'s watched a lot of porn) so he\'s trying to play his part even though it\'s weird and unnatural. Sex is supposed to be about empathetically responding to each other, not using the other person as a prop in playing out a fantasy and when he starts saying ""You\'re my doll, I want to eat you"" and not picking up on the fact that you\'re not enjoying it, it\'s really dehumanizing not just for the specific words he chose but because he\'s not using the words to try to connect with you or make you feel something, he\'s doing it to make himself feel something about you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>they asked me if they could cum on my face which really took me by surprise.\n\nThat is confirmation that he has become porn obsessed. Cuming on someone\'s face doesn\'t actually feel good. It doesn\'t feel any different to a regular orgasm. It\'s what\'s used in porn because porn has to be extremely visual. In real life the visual isn\'t nearly as important as the actual experience. He\'s started to treat real life as if he was making a porno. That\'s why it felt to you like sex with a teenage boy. Usually as men mature they start to understand the difference between porn and real life but he has made a choice to try to make real life like porn. You didn\'t ""put your foot in it"" you put your finger on it and that\'s why he was so angry with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Anyway, when I get harassed it puts them in a dangerously bad mood. I feel like I have to tiptoe around them and coax them out of it.\n\nThat\'s emotional abuse. If my husband is in a bad mood I try to cheer him up because I love him but if that doesn\'t work I shrug and go on with my day because his emotions are his responsibility not mine. I certainly don\'t feel like his emotions are \'dangerous\'.\n\nThe next few paragraphs honestly make me scared for you. He\'s escalating. He\'s becoming more possessive and controlling over time. He\'s afraid of \'someone else taking you\' and that\'s the attitude men have when they murder their exes. You belong to him, no one else can have you, not even yourself.\n\n>That voice inside me said that if they had been cis woman, I would have a better chance of shoving her off.\n\nAlso a woman couldn\'t have had her dick inside you. He is a man. It\'s ok to know that. It doesn\'t make you bad. Consent is really a bad way to frame sex. Consent is a bare minimum. Really the guide should be ""don\'t have sex with anyone who doesn\'t want to have sex with you or in a way that they don\'t enjoy."" Consent is one tool for going about that but you should also use empathy, experience, and sense. If you had said \'yes\' with a knife to your throat that wouldn\'t be consent. You said \'yes\' to a guy who already had his dick inside you in a situation where you didn\'t feel safe to say no. That is not consent. He should have known you weren\'t happy.\n\n>I’m honestly ashamed of how badly my relationship has gotten. Nothing has happened the way it should have. I wanted to be a good girlfriend and ally but all that’s happened is I’m looking back at the past year and wondering how it became such a fucking mess\n\nYou wanted to be a good girlfriend and ally and you were told the way to do that is to be obedient. Your relationship disintegrated because a relationship involves two partners, not one man and his support animal. You did your best but nothing you did could have saved this relationship. If you hadn\'t done everything you could for him it would have ended harder and earlier but it was always going to go this way because there\'s no way this guy would tolerate having a partner with her own ideas and needs that are as important as his.\n\nAs for what to do, **please be careful**. This has the potential to go really badly really quickly. You might think he wouldn\'t harm you but just keep in mind how much he has changed already and that he might change even more when you leave. I would not say anything yet. Pack a bag of your important stuff (your documents, sentimental items, favorite clothes etc) and stash them at your friends place. Do not let him catch you doing this and if he goes looking for something that you\'ve stashed tell him you don\'t know and you must have lost it. ""Loan"" any high value items (like the sewing machine) to another friend who ""needs to borrow it"". Give yourself a week or two so that what\'s left in that house is stuff you can live without. Are your finances separate? If they are joined talk to the bank, tell them your situation and see what they can do about freezing it or freezing part of it. You might want to call a women\'s hotline too to see what your rights are to joint finances. When you do break up, break up in a public place, then leave immediately. Don\'t go back to the house. Ask if you can have a friend go to collect the rest of your stuff and possible have the police go too if there\'s no mutual friend that you can trust and trust him to be safe with. Then **leave**. The friend you are taking care of now sounds great but it also sounds like he knows where she lives. Find a friend or family member, or friend of a friends of a family member who lives somewhere a decent distance away that he doesn\'t know about. Stay with them for a while if you can. If not, TELL him you are staying with Sickfriend, have her confirm that you are staying there if he asks, but actually stay somewhere completely different. Be prepared that he might follow you or harass you at your job or at school. **Don\'t block him** on the phone or on the internet. If he starts to go crazy and send you threats you need to be able to see them so you know that you are in danger and have a record of them. But do not respond either, that will only encourage him.\n\nThat being said, he might move on just fine. He might enjoy being single and getting to be \'free\' with his new identity. I can\'t predict the future. I am worried about you though. It sounds like he is unstable and his main priority in life is controlling you and \'being a lesbian\'. With you gone he has nothing and murder suicide is a thing, even if some of them chicken out of the suicide bit.\n\nYou\'ve been trained for a few years (and it sounds like your whole life to some extent) to doubt your feelings and think \'it\'s not that bad\' or \'he probably didn\'t mean it\' or \'he needs this from me right now\'. Please please please, for once listen to your own instincts, believe them the first time and without confirmation, and act to put yourself first. Your life could depend on it. By this I mean if you break up and he \'invites you over for coffee to chat\' and you feel weird about it - Don\'t go. No matter what your brain says listen to your gut.\n\nStart calling womens services now and as soon as you leave start telling trusted friends and family about the situation you\'re in.', 'Oh my love so much about this is wrong. So much is you trying so so hard to be a good girlfriend. I can feel the pain pouring out of your post. \n\nI can’t expand on anything that anyone else has said. Please try and take care of yourself. Regardless of gender expression, your partner is being abusive. He has raped you. The only acceptable amount of abuse is no abuse. \n\nSolidarity and love from me.', 'Wow! This entire posts embodies how women and girls are taught to value other people\'s feelings above their own. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou do not owe anyone an apology for your feelings. You do not owe anyone a list of justifications for wanting to get out of a relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you need to get to know yourself and your feelings a little better. Maybe that can be the ""excuse"" you give to your partner and to anyone who knows you as a couple.  And then simply end the conversation and get on with your life!', ""We're all bird people here. <3"", 'Thank you for sharing your story. \n\nYou don’t deserve any of this from anyone, and especially not from your partner., and you are not obliged to endure pain, anguish and emotional devastation inflicted upon you by them whether they are transitioning or not.

It will be painful, but you deserve freedom and good, honest love and kindness from your intimates (friends, family, partner).\n\nGood luck and remember there’s a whole sub here if you need support. ❤️', 'I feel so sad for you.  This must be agony.\n\nObviously you can\'t stay with them.  And even in the unlikely event that you can repair your friendship after what happened sexually before you left, you will absolutely NEED to take a break from spending any time or having contact with them first.\n\nYou can\'t be someone\'s girlfriend under these circumstances. It\'s too creepy, too obsessive, too demanding, just too much. It\'s sad that your partner is going through this but you mustn\'t give up your very being to make them feel better. \n\nThe gender thing with this person ... it\'s interesting to me that being a ""woman"" has brought out some more stereotypically ""masculine"" qualities. The entitlement, the jealousy, the aggression, the porny sex. It seems like maybe they\'re getting their cues from trans subs full of creepy TIMs who are porn-mad and talking about what kind of sex they want to have and what kind of language they think lesbians use, and so on.\n\nI would be scared to do the breakup talk too but I think they need to hear it. Maybe a woman friend can support you? Maybe you can write to them so you can really give thought to the words you want to use? I would say the best thing is not to focus on the gender - you\'ve said that wasn\'t really the issue - but rather, the fact that they now don\'t listen to you and your needs and wants any more; that you have started to feel like an object rather than a partner; that you need to step away so you can move forward in your life in a healthy manner.  \n\n\nI\'ve had perfectly normal relationships break up and without exception I think that the ONLY way any relationship can shift comfortably to friendship is with a good three months or more of non contact. Preferably with some activity with someone new that allows you to shift your erotic focus.  After that you MIGHT be able to go back to being ""girl friends"". If he meets someone else that will probably easily happen, provided he sticks to the boundaries you set in place. But only you can make that choice and I suspect down the track you might not want him in your life any more.  \n\n\nI feel sorry for him, I do. But you need to look after yourself. It\'s not your job to fix him.', 'I was married to a man who developed a very complex mental illness. I had to work extremely hard to develop and maintain boundaries. But he transgressed them all the time. Sure I know he couldn’t really help it. But it had the same impact on me. We ended up separating because I could not continue to live with it. \n\nYour relationship sounds similar. Leaving aside the fact your partner is transgender, if someone is continually transgressing boundaries you’ve set (the sex, the comments about your appearance) even if you feel like there are mitigating circumstances they don’t respect you. Sure everyone makes a mistake every now and then but constantly?  They’re not trying to meet your needs. \n\nGood luck.

I find it very interesting that they don't want you to read what they're saying, and they don't want you to read what we're saying, yet they expect you to blindly believe everything they tell you about themselves and about us. Questioning any of their rhetoric gets you labelled a terf, even when you go to them for help. Please know you are allowed to ask questions here. You are allowed to voice your concerns.

Here\'s what I\'m seeing. \n\n>There were a lot of things about our relationship that I left out because I know it doesn’t make them look good and I thought “well if you take it out of context, if you don’t factor in their dysphoria and their depression of course it looks like their treating me badly but I love them and it’s not like that.”\n\nYou\'re making excuses for abuse. Huge red flag. Huge one. I\'ve seen it so, so many times in friends whose partners were abusing them. The abuse is never ever your fault -- but it\'s also not excusable, not by dysphoria, not by depression, not by anything else. Your partner is making a choice to abuse and mistreat you. Period.\n\n>How do I not cave if they pull a “life has no meaning without you I’ll kill myself” on me? \n\nSuicidal threats = classic abuser move \n\nAnd as hard as it\'s going to be, this is something that you might just have to call your partner\'s bluff on. Hand them the number to a suicide helpline/Samaritans, call their family to let them know that your former partner is making suicidal threats (or call the police to notify them), and then leave.\n\n>Can we still be friends? What if I don’t want that?\n\nWould you want to be friends with any other person who was being abusive to you? No? Then don\'t be friends.\n\n>Now getting cat-called is a disaster in the works ... when I get harassed it puts them in a dangerously bad mood. I feel like I have to tiptoe around them and coax them out of it. But if it happens more than once when we’re out there’s no saving the evening. I tried to talk to them about it but they refuses to talk to me saying “I wouldn’t understand.” It makes them get quite possessive, which honestly frightens me a little. They would hold me and tell me that I’m “just for them.” They’re convinced I’m going to leave them for someone else and I keep having to convince them that I’m here with them and I wouldn’t.\n\nThis is abusive. Period. End of story. \n\n> They thrust themselves in and I was just frozen. I panicked and started tussling . I pushed against their chest and their shoulders, trying to get them off of me or just give me some space- I wasn’t thinking clearly, but I couldn’t get them to budge. They started petting my hair and hushing me like I was some sort of distressed child but I did calm down. I wasn’t as tense and had probably stretched to accommodate as it didn’t really hurt anymore.\n\nI don\'t even know what to say about this, but my heart hurts for you. This is absolutely abusive. \n\n>The problem I’m having in general with our relationship is that they’re not the person that was my best friend anymore. \n\nI\'m so sorry. And this is what you need to tell them when you\'re ready to break up. I\'m not going to tell you to break up right this minute because I know it\'s hard, I know it can be terrifying, and I know you might not be ready. But when you are -- this is what you say. ""We\'ve changed. We\'re not the people we were. We\'re going different directions, and we want different things, and we\'re different people."" And that\'s okay. People do grow and change and go different directions. Sometimes you grow and change and figure out how to move together -- but sometimes you don\'t. \n\n>I’m honestly ashamed of how badly my relationship has gotten. \n\nYou deserve no shame for this.

They\'ll say ""no the [slurs] are"". I don\'t usually do this but since this post is running long and I still have a lot to get through I\'m going to rely on my credentials. I\'m a cancer biologist that specializes in female reproductive cancers (I\'m being a tad vague here to try to not be doxxed). If you want to have a conversation about the science behind being transgender, I can inundate you with more research and scientific backed arguments, as well as, counterarguments to terf claims than you will know what to do with. I think this is out of the scope of this post so I just want to say that **TERFs are anti-science - of the same vein as climate change deniers, anti vaxxers, flat earthers, anti-GMOs, anti-dark matter, or any other anti-science movement that’s gained traction in the last decade**. Be highly skeptical of any claims that don\'t come with sources, and be highly skeptical of any sources that aren\'t from high impact journals or authors.\n\n>\tThey say they don\'t hate trans people, but take one look on the sub or relevant subs and its clear as daylight. **They wish we were all dead**. In fact, they\'ve often said the same thing. If they say they don\'t hate trans people, look no further than the front page and the top most voted comments to see **rampant transphobia and rhetoric that rivals neonazi rhetoric**.\n\n>\tThey DO NOT argue or discuss in good faith. They\'ll use every trick in the book including **logical fallacies, rhetoric tools, and straight up lying/gaslighting to “prove” their point(s)**. Be extra diligent about this. (For instance that girlschool subreddit you posted, was most likely if i\'m guessing correctly linked on one of their pages without any context - it is NOT a trans page and as far as I\'m aware as never been a trans page. It is a fetish page for crossdressers - some of those people might find out one day they are trans but the vast majority won\'t. TERFs want to blur the line between fetish crossdressers and trans women because it suits their rhetoric ignoring that the vast majority of trans people don\'t cross dress as a fetish and never have).\n\n>And lastly, no matter how diligent you are, **don’t stay too long. You will inevitably read enough material to become indoctrinated and internalize some or all of it. The longer you stay the quicker this happens**. I know this because I frequent the page and related subs occasionally to try to stop the spread of misinformation and almost always end up internalizing some of it and have even found myself at one point spouting terf rhetoric despite my better judgement.\n\n>Lastly, I hope you remain a good ally.

It sounds absolutely horrific.\n\nIn terms of what to do when your partner shows up is, I would suggest, to phone the police.  Ask them to leave first, obviously.  Don\'t let them in.  Maybe speak to them through the door if you have to.  Don\'t engage in conversation.  Straight ""yes"" or ""no"" responses, and repeat the fact that you\'re not willing to talk and then end the conversation.

And then send her ""mom hugs"".  How fucking dare you', 'You have gotten a lot of great replies here from other women saying so many of the things I thought while reading your post, so I will not go into great lengths about all of the things that can be said. I want to focus on three things that I wish to put some emphasis on:\n\n1) I\'m very sorry about the way the other version of this post (the one you posted on the other forum) was reacted to. Shunning you for daring to even explore a gc place is not okay. People who cannot sympathise with a woman who has suffered abuse because that woman holds the ""wrong political ideas"" (or, in this case, because that woman dares to seek *emotional support* from women who hold the ""wrong political ideas"") *simply cannot sympathise.*\n\nThere was an incident some time ago where I live, where a right-wing, nationalist woman who had suffered rape was refused to speak about her experience on stage, in a place that was supposed to be politically independent. The reason was that the people in charge of the event did not agree with the opinions of the political party she was a member of. I said it then and I will say it again now: a survivor of abuse should never ever be silenced because she has a political opinion that you dislike. Women who suffer abuse need to be allowed to talk about that abuse, no matter what their opinions are, no matter what their religion is, no matter who the abuser was - no matter what. Even if you were a full blown nazi, your experiences as a victim of abuse puts you in a position where you need and deserve support.\n\n2) Your experiences during the sexual trauma (which would be labeled rape in the country where I live, where consent needs to be given *before* ***and*** *during* sexual contact) are not uncommon and don\'t make them any less nonconsensual. Many women are unable to stop ongoing rape. Many women say ""yes"" if the person raping them asks them if it\'s okay *while the rape is going on*. Asking for consent *after* doing something isn\'t asking for consent at all.\n\nTo give some perspective on this, I will tell you about something that happened not too long ago in my own relationship. For context, I\'m in a wonderful relationship with a man who has never been abusive towards me, who respects me and who treats me as his sexual, romantic and intellectual equal. He is, however, sexually inexperienced and insecure, and sometimes he\'s simply *dumb*. He would never do anything to me that would in any way be nonconsensual. But, as I said, he\'s insecure and dumb sexually. I\'m extremely experienced and secure in what I like and don\'t. Well, I mentioned sometime ago, when we talked about anal stuff, that I sometimes enjoy *a little* anal stimulation during intercourse. Him, being a moron, did this to me while we were having sex, without verbal warning. One might expect that this would have me stop the sexual encounter or at least that part, because I am completely safe in the knowledge that he would listen, he would stop, he would respect my boundaries. But, you see, none of that means anything when you\'re in the vulnerable state which sex is. No matter how much you actually trust the person you\'re having sex with, being able to communicate ""stop"" during an ongoing sexual interaction is *extremely hard* for women. It\'s not something we\'re taught to do. Having sex with a man is to be in a vulnerable position and you will act according to your survival instincts. *No matter how much you, intellectually, know that this is not a dangerous situation, your body does not know.* Your intellect has no power over you in this situation.\n\nSo what did I do? I let it be and we had sex until he finished. Afterwards, I went to the bathroom and cleaned up, etc. Then, when we were lying in bed together, I said ""Oh, by the way"", sat up, slapped him *hard* in the face, and said ""don\'t ever fucking do that again"". This was the way I was able to show my personal boundaries. My heart was pounding, I was angry (because I was no longer in the vulnerable position of having a man inside of me doing something I didn\'t want) and no, I wasn\'t comfortable saying no, I wasn\'t comfortable in anything right there, but I did what I needed to do in order to show my boundaries - which, for me, was to slap him in the face for fucking up.\n\nI don\'t say this because I condone any type of physical violence (don\'t slap your partners if you can avoid it, but I sure as hell won\'t judge someone who slaps someone as a response to a nonconsensual sexual act). I say it because I want to show you that even someone who can react the way I did, someone who can seriously slap their partner hard in the face to show a boundary, with absolutely no fear at all that it will leave me in a dangerous or scary situation, *is still unable to stop the nonconsensual act while it\'s going on.* I\'m fairly certain you wouldn\'t dare slap your partner and that the thought of that scares you, so it\'s totally understandable that you said yes. You said yes to protect yourself. What he did was still rape. What he did was horrible. What he did was not okay.\n\n3) Leave in the way that is *safest* for you. You can explain why to him if you feel like it, but leave first. This is a person who has threatened with suicide, treated your body with disrespect, and hurt you. It is possible that you leaving will create a situation that is physically dangerous for you to be in. If you live together, arrange for a friend (preferably male - brother, father, other male friends) to go with you and help you collect your things. Instruct the person/people accompanying you to call 112/999 if your partners threatens suicide while you\'re leaving. Remember to tell the people helping you that your partner has been abusive and that you are afraid of the reaction to you leaving. Make certain that they know you are scared and that you have a reason to be, *and* that your partner will try to make it seem like you\'re being crazy and unreasonable. Make sure that the people helping you are *on your side.* Move and don\'t say where you\'re moving. If he harasses you, change your phone number and e-mail address and don\'t contact him again. Before anything else, make sure that you are safe. You have decided to leave him and there is *no situation* in which you ever need to be alone with him again.\n\nPlease stay safe and take care of yourself.', ""First, thank you for sharing your story. It takes courage to face what's truly going on in your life, especially in a relationship like this one. I want to try to answer your question regarding how to break up with them, but first, let me point out a couple of things. I recognize all too well some of the things you are speaking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Your partner RAPED you. You told them no, he ignored you. Don't let his gas-lighting while raping you invalidate your feelings of violation, because You. Were. Violated. Whether you report them or not is up to you. I can't advise you there, as it's a lot more than I know I could have handled in the same situation and I would not have. Did not.\n2. Good for you to go to your friend's immediately!\n3. Language in trans-world is where they mess you up. I have a teen who is going through a really hard time right now. Speak YOUR truth. What YOU know to be true. Quit trying to make everyone else happy. Cis privilege? Please. Don't let others dictate how you should feel about yourself.\n4. About making everyone else happy? STOP. Your first responsibility is to yourself. We as women are brought up to be people pleasers and make the men around us happy. Stop it. This is not easy, but it is necessary for your own well-being. Whether your partner has identified as MTF or not, he's still a man and acts the way he was taught. You, as a sane, sensible person, and an adult, CHOOSE how you interact with the world. You choose what you will allow to stay around you and who you interact with. ACT, don't Re-Act.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, take some time while you are at your girlfriends to think about who YOU are. How YOU want to be treated. What behaviors you will no longer tolerate in your own home. Find your truth, and stand in it. As we grow older, that can change, defining who you are now, doesn't lock you in forever. As I grow older, I've had to re-evaluate how I feel about a lot of things, and that's ok. When I was training to be an EMT and first responder, we were taught 1. You are responsible first for yourself. If you are not ok, you cannot help anyone else. 2. You're responsible for your partner second. 3. After you've made sure you and your partner are okay, THEN you can help others. It does no one any good for you to run into a situation without assessing it first. I can't emphasize enough how much these rules have helped me in every situation since. You can't do anything for anyone else until you help yourself first. Make a decision, and while the path may not be easy, you can at least now see the path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout breaking up. This man, no matter how the relationship started, is abusing you. Abusers don't get the right to try to talk you out of anything. He's emotionally abusive by his manipulation of your feelings and gas-lighting. He's physically abusive by ~~forcing himself upon~~ raping you. **You do not owe this person anything.** You do owe yourself safety as much as possible. Is there a time when you know he will not be at the apartment where you can remove your things without his knowledge? If so, get friends you trust to help, go get your things and take up your friend on their offer to be a roommate, or stay as long as it takes to find your own space. Don't leave anything behind that you want or need.\n\nFor your own sake, cut off all communication. Letting this person have contact with you makes it harder for you to process. Even people who break up amicably do better if they do not see or talk to each other for a while. You need time to process all of this and having them around makes things confusing. Give yourself space and time to heal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed grammar and spelling."", 'Do you both work? If so - only go back to get your stuff while he’s at work. Take the day off and go with a friend. Call the police if he shows up and makes a stink', "" *Do I tell them why? I would want to know why but it’s hard when the reasons are “now you treat me like shit.” How do I not cave if they pull a “life has no meaning without you I’ll kill myself” on me? Can we still be friends? What if I don’t want that?* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes - tell them that you are unhappy and your feelings of love have changed and that you feel they don't treat you well. That you need to change your life, and that you will be doing it without them. Its okay to say that you are sad about it, and that you appreciate the good times that you had together, but don't apologise to them or compromise. You deserve to live your life with honesty and integrity and happiness and safety. they are not safe for you to be with any more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they threaten suicide, tell them that you care about them, but that you won't be staying with them. Call their mother or family or the police/mental health crisis service. They do not have to be abandoned with those feelings, but they do not get to demand to have YOU to deal with those feelings."", 'Regardless of discussions on gender - relationships are hard, and relationships with someone narcissistic or abusive are awful. Please take care of yourself and get the support you need. I know you’re just trying your best and you’re tired. Sometimes the internet can help and make you feel understood, but sometimes it can also be a confusing place full of many opinions, so make sure you get some good friends around you to support you in real life as well (and/or a good therapist). Hugs.\n\nEdit: I just read your post again more properly. I’m so sorry the abuse went from emotional to straight up sexual. When I was in a relationship with somebody so toxic (not trans though), the sub narcissistic abuse helped me a lot. Abuse and manipulation always function along the same lines (gaslighting, erosion of your self-esteem, etc.) regardless of sex/gender, and it’s a good place full of ressources. Best of luck.', ""You're not transpobic. But you shouldn't have to be a martyr either. Get out and don't feel the need to stay to be someone else crutch. You tried, harder than most and it's only getting worse. Run for the hills and don't be emotionally blackmailed into staying in an unlivable situation."", 'I keep getting stuck on how drastic the changes in your partner seem to have been. It’s almost as if they concluded that if you haven’t left them for being trans, so you won’t leave them for acting this way, but I feel you would have known if everything previously was insincere. And in that case, they’re choosing to react and behave the way they are now. Trans people I know have always been the same person on a fundamental level - they just feel more comfortable doing things or wearing things that relate heavily to their ideal presentation. This whole drastic change is wrong. All I can add is that the ‘you’re my life I don’t see the point in living without you’ play that you’ve mentioned may come when you end things is an emotional abuse tactic, and only further solidifies that you need to get out of this relationship. You can continue to be there to help with transition and such if you want, but personally I’d limit that to safe spaces for the time being and avoid being alone with them.', ""OP thanks for sharing your story. I think you've gotten enough advice at the hands of the wonderful women of this sub. I just want to say, I'm so sorry he's done that to you. I'm thinking of you, make a plan to get out as safely as possible. Confiding in your friend might be a good idea."", ""Please, be selfish. \n\nDo what's best for you.\n\nok so the question is how?\n\nA) You don't have to give a reason. If you want to, keep it brief and vague. But you don't need a reason to break up with someone. Being unhappy and unfulfilled should be enough of a reason.\n\nB) If he threatens suicide tell one of his friends or family but it's not your concern anymore. Tell him he is strong and that he can get through this. \n\nC) No contact. As soon as you can, do the no contact thing. If you want to set up a date to talk with him more in detail you can do that no sooner than 2 months down the line. You've been together for 3 years so it's gonna take a bit of time. No contact/social media is such a great thing to get you to focus on YOUR life again. \n\nD) Keep telling yourself how brave and strong and independent you are. Because you are. You are doing something good for yourself because your life has meaning outside of some guy and his problems. You are strong."", 'Oh hun I’m so sorry your boyfriend has been treating you like that.\n\nIn all honesty it looks to me like he’s a classic, narcissist abuser.\n\nHe makes racist comments and belittles you. Threatens to kill him self when you stand up for yourself (99.999% of the time the suicide threats are manipulative tactics to guilt you into staying- don’t worry about him killing him self when you escape, he’ll be fine and if he’s not, it’s 100% not your fault).\n\nSo your last paragraph about him getting out of the shower and wanting sex was a graphic description of him raping you.\n\nThis man is highly dangerous, highly abusive and you will be much safer being as far away from him as humanly possible.\n\nYou are not transphobic, you are not a bad person and you are not to blame for his abusive behaviour.\n\nYou’ve already sacrificed years of your life, your mental health and physical safety to him. You owe him nothing.\n\nYou deserve a partner who loves you, respects you, honours your feelings and mostly, who doesn’t rape and abuse you.\n\nI would strongly suggest going to a woman’s shelter when you leave because there’s a good chance he’ll become violent and they have the knowledge and resources to protect you.\n\nGood luck, you deserve better.', 'I am so sorry this happened to you.

b4bj2c,b4bj2c,"The creepy mannerisms are worse than the clothes and makeup, tbh","A while back, when I was still an ""ally"" I watched the first documentary about the trans community, with one central TIM. It was made in something like 1980. He was an HSTS. AGPs hadn't surfaced yet. He was beautiful and seemed like a sweet, gentle person. But I noticed one thing that really stuck out like a sore thumb. When he picked up his mother at the airport, he walked while sticking his hand out at a right angle, swishing it to and fro. Like women in 50s cartoons. Walking next to his mother, who was, well, just walking, it was even more noticeable. Women don't walk like that. No woman walks around like a mid-century cartoon. I wondered what on earth gave him the idea that we did, because he certainly hadn't observed women doing that.

Fast forward. I saw an AGP photoshoot where this neanderthal in his 50s was posing with one leg up like a flamingo, his hand daintily at his ear. In every photo, even group ones at events. Now I was just grossed out. Enter Contra Points, who started twirling his hair and speaking in an 80's teen valley girl accent, and claiming to be puzzled why even his fans thought that was too far.

I'm not talking natural flamboyance. I'm talking mimicking females through the lens of cartoons. I find it more insulting than the clothes, hair and makeup. You are not Jessica Rabbit. You aren't even using porn as your base; you are using comedic tropes. If I went as an Irishman to a Halloween party, in a carrot top fro wig, leprechaun pants and saying ""top o' the mornin' to ya!"" that would be analogous to what you are doing. You are not acting extra feminine to ""present"" as anything. You are Bugs Bunny in a swell little sweater set. Try drag.

cx1vah,cx1vah,This sub made my marriage better,"My husband’s always randomly smacked my butt. I thought it was cute when we were dating and early in the marriage, but now I just had a baby and I’m sleep deprived and fucking over it. I told him it’s one thing if it’s like a gentle, flirtatious pat, but he’d gotten into the habit of sneaking up on me and hitting my ass hard, usually when I was concentrating on another task. Like leaning over a stove, cutting food, or changing the baby’s diaper. He thinks it’s funny to see me surprised. 

I’d been asking him to stop with varying degrees of annoyance in my voice but he’s totally blown me off. Saying, “I’m just flirting with my wife.” I told him it’s only flirting if it makes me have happy feelings toward him, not angry feelings. But he just says “relax.”

So finally one morning, he was sitting in a chair and I bent over to pick up a toy off the floor and he KICKED me in the ass! Not enough to make me stagger but still, I was shocked. 

I told him that he cannot kick me, and he said “but it was your butt!” And I told him it doesn’t fucking matter where on my body, he cannot kick me ever. And I don’t want him ever smacking my butt hard ever again. It used to be flirtatious but he’s ruined it by ignoring my requests to stop so many times. He was surprised but also acted kind of amused and told me to relax and let’s have breakfast together. But I scooped our daughter up and said I am leaving the house. 

He followed me into the bedroom to try to talk and I told him this is not Saudi Arabia, and I am not his slave, and I can leave whenever I want. I asked him how he would feel if our daughter grew up to have a boyfriend who kicked her. He kept saying, “it was just your butt!” And he started apologizing and asking me not to leave, and where was I going, and not to take the baby.

I told him that if we were divorced he would have no say over what I do with our children during my parenting time, which seemed to shock him, and finally I told him (thanks r/GenderCritical) that he isn’t in charge of me just because he’s stronger than me. 

He told me he wasn’t trying to be in charge of me, and I told him if that’s true then prove it and step aside and let us leave. So he did, and we went to breakfast at a restaurant and then to the park until her nap time. 

After we came home, he apologized again and said he didn’t realize how I felt. (That isn’t because I didn’t tell him many times, however I guess it had to be a dramatic spectacle to catch his attention.) Anyway, that was about 2 months ago and I’ve gone from multiple butt smacks per day to zero.

PS, I’m not trying to make it sound like my husband’s an ogre, he works hard and helps with cleaning and childcare, but I don’t think he truly realized just how damaging this was to our relationship. I was in a constant, low-moderate grade state of pissed off at him. Which made us fight more and me less likely to do nice things for him. Anyway, the relationship has been better for us both lately. Thanks for giving me better language to express what I was going through, ladies.",507,"['This is a pattern I\'ve noticed in a lot of the men I\'ve known.

And it can also help you break the cycle of unhealthy power dynamics in nonabusive relationships. \n\nMy current relationship is so much better than it would otherwise be because I took this to heart: \n\n>The abuser will quickly gain authority by making lots of decisions and getting you to agree. ""Meet me at the cafe at 6."" ""Ok,"" you say. ""Let\'s sit over here."" ""Ok,"" you say. ""Try this,"" or ""Don\'t eat that. It\'s not good for you."" ""Ok,"" you say. You say yes because you want him to like you and think you\'re easy going. But your brain adapts. In a short time, he\'ll give orders and you\'ll just obey. \n\nTo be clear, my partner is a super gentle empathetic guy. But we\'re all socialized to behave a certain way, especially during the early dating stage of a relationship. Men are socialized to be decisive and make suggestions. They see that as being polite and engaged. Women are socialized to be easygoing.\n\nBut if you just let those roles play out then, before you know it, ""Your brain adapts."" Suddenly you\'re in a coercive relationship that neither of you wanted, or is enjoying. \n\nI had to make a conscious decision to consider whether my answer was actually ""Ok"" to some innocuous requests. And it was so hard, even to turn down food that I didn\'t really want, that I realized right away that this is a real phenomenon. \n\nBut it did make both of us more happy.', 'I totally agree! My husband did this too, and like you, it started to bother me after having babies. I think you really critically think about your boundaries a lot more after you have kids. You have to surrender your physical boundaries to your baby to some extent, and you just can’t give that leeway to your husband like you used to. I don’t have the emotional energy to put up with stuff I don’t like. \n\nMy husband also uses the “I’m just flirting with my wife” line. I always tell him to examine why he’s saying it that way. “I’m flirting with *my wife*”. *MY*.

The thing is a lot of domestic violence begins during or right after a pregnancy. The theory is that the woman is paying less attention to the man, so the abuse begins. The woman is dressing differently, acting differently, and the man isn't the center of attention. \n\nFor the OP and the other women, this sounds like what is happening. I mean, he KICKED her.

I admire you drawing a line and hope you will leave if he pulls this again. \n\nWhat your husband did is physical abuse. You may feel like we’re catastrophizing or making him out to be a monster (“ogre”), but it really is monstrous to smack and kick you in the name of flirtation. \n\nThis just so damn common that it’s hard to see it as unacceptable or violent. His explanation, “I am just flirting with *my* wife,” demonstrated his subconscious male entitlement; he was literally giving the fact that you are “his” with more weight than what his wife as a person is actually directly saying she wants!  This sense of entitlement is universal among men, and many act WAY more entitled than yours did here, but that is not okay either.\n\n  \nThere are always MUCH worse men, so it can be tempting to say, he’s not “that bad” in comparison.  I’ve made this justification many times, even when my friends have warned me my then boyfriend was abusive. \n\nThe bar for men’s behavior is so low it’s underground. Cheers to your courage and remember your worth♥️', ""Those slaps were abusive. Slapping you while concentrating on something else just to see you jump sounds like he enjoyed startling you. The kick was escalating the abuse. I don't understand his excuse: “it was just your butt!” Butts are made for kicking? WTF!?!\n\nI have a very high startle reflex. The very first time my husband (then boyfriend) thought it was funny to startle me, he soon learned that I would leave anyone that treated me that way.

I\'m glad you\'ve established boundaries and I hope they last. I would have kicked him right back if I had been in that situation to be honest.\n\nI kinda see where it\'s coming from, though - if you look at male friendships, most of them constantly hit and roast and generally humiliate eachother ""out of fun"" and call it ""bonding"". So they can\'t grasp it\'s actually serious when someone else tells them to stop, because their brains don\'t register it. They don\'t seem to understand boundaries because no one ever tells them they have to establish them, because ""boys will be boys"". They also don\'t know how to take relationships seriously because of this - everything is a joke to them.\n\nI like analyzing them to see where it stems from, but this isn\'t an excuse. It\'s pathetic they don\'t see it and/or want to see it.', ""Honestly, you should have actually left him right then. Like, for a few days at least. Gone to your mom's, or a friend's place.

He'll excuse this behavior by calling it cute and affectionate, but what he's really doing is establishing the dominance he felt he lost. He's re-establishing his sacred right to touch his property whenever he pleases.\n\nIt will start soon, if it hasn't already.\n\nAlso, it *really, really* concerns me that he physically blocked you and the baby from leaving the house. That's like the biggest red flag there is.\n\nYou need to create an exit strategy. It's better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it. You will feel much more in control knowing you can pick up the pre-packed suitcase and just *go.*\n\nOP, obviously we don't know the details of your marriage.

He understood from the very first time you told him you didn\'t like it. But he, like most men, didn\'t believe he HAD to listen. Now that there are displeasing consequences for HIM, he has suddenly ""realized"".\n\nWe are told from birth that men are superior intellects. We are also constantly told to forgive men when they do wrong because they are bumbling clueless idiots. Which is it?!\n\nWe are told from birth that men are logical, rational, and in control of their emotions. We are also told that if we hold them accountable for their actions, that it hurts their feelings so much. They didn\'t mean anything by it after all, they just wanted to make you smile, think how they feel, why are you so mean for attempting any agency whatsoever?\n\nWomen are subject to extreme conflicting pressures on every facet of life, all the time. The good news is that once you see the pattern, you\'ll see it everywhere because it is fucking everywhere, and the thread unravels fast. We women need to be passing this message on to young women and girls.\n\nIt is excellent that you took a stand for yourself.  However, watch him closely for these patterns. Watch for entitlement; diminishment and denial of your words; playing dumb to get out of being held accountable.  Even the best men have these patterns, and you will probably see them again. \n\nAnother thing that resonated with me: \n> I was in a constant, low-moderate grade state of pissed off at him. \n\nAbsolutely felt that too. And if you never get time alone, that feeling becomes your new normal. As a new mother it must be really hard to get time alone. But whenever you do, be aware of how you feel as an individual. Then compare it to how you feel as a person when around him. Do you feel more free, or less? More strong and sure, or less? I do this constantly. When I\'m on my own I feel like a goddamned phoenix from the ashes. When I\'m with my partner suddenly I\'m questioning everything I do. It\'s a sad state of normal.

b4rynu,b4rynu,A group of white TIMs in my community have come out as Muslim women.,"They wear hijab and post pictures of themselves on Facebook.

I found out about this because I volunteer at a women’s center that has a program to connect refugees with community resources. A TIM in hijab showed up at a weekly English class asking the women to help him learn Arabic (most of these women speak Kurdish).

Everyone was very polite to him, and he didn’t cause a scene, but said he would bring the other “Muslim women” he knows to the center so they could also get support. But support for what?!

Talk about mommy issues. Having worked fast food I can tell you that 95% of our problematic customers were men. If a woman ever rolled her eyes at me or said something stupid, it was nothing compared to the aggressive, creepy, transgressive and destructive behavior constantly displayed by males. I never had to come up with a plan with my female coworkers for what to do if a *woman* customer came back to the store.

Just a thought.

Edit: connected to this also is the hate for  ""dependas"", helicopter moms, anti-vaxxers and MLMs. Not that I agree with anti-vax or MLMs but it's all just a socially sanctioned excuse to hate women. 

Edit 2: Thanks for all the interesting discussion, everyone. Please note that even if there is some amount of truth about or justified dislike against the groups we're talking about, there is always a double standard in play. Yes, anti-vaxxers and MLMs are really bad! But the point is that male hatred always singles out female behavioral patterns. To men, nothing is worse than an ""entitled"" woman, a woman who gets in your face and annoys you, a woman with unorthodox opinions who does not shut up and respect male authority. There are *so many* equally toxic predominantly male behaviors that are ignored, dismissed or rationalized in our culture because women or feminists are the only ones talking about them.

But I think this just illustrates a deeper misogyny - women are expected to be the children\'s caretaker, so they make all the medical decisions. Of course the fathers don\'t promote antivax, they aren\'t concerned with their kids\' vaccination at all.\n\nPoor behavior from men is normal. Poor behavior from women is inexcusable.

And yes, I hate it, because it's a social acceptable way to attack women of a particular age (and race) without directly acknowledging that that is what you are doing.

This poor girl was assaulted and raped and her abuser came out as trans. All the TIMs in the responses are virtually saying the same thing ""It's awful you were assaulted but you need to respect your rapist's pronouns""  
The real highlight is if you scroll down to the very bottom, where you have a commentor saying that rape victims can go to therapy and ""get over"" rape, but poor TIMs have to deal with transphobia every day. Also that because op was a lesbian, her rejecting him may have invalidated him while he was questioning himself.  
I only really lurk in radfem circles and saw this thing a while ago but it's been eating at the back of my head for so long I figured I might as well make an account and post it here.

We deny a lot of realities for the sake of TIM demands, but this one is not only exceptionally dangerous but flat-out insulting for gay men.

___

Edit: Since people are debating over what the rules actually are...

The Red Cross tests each unit (except in emergency situations), but this is *after* eliminating who donates in the first place. **Their rules ban men who had sex with other men in the past 12 months from donating. However, TIMs who have sex with other men are not blocked access.**

>The Red Cross tests each unit of donated blood for a number of infectious diseases. While testing has greatly improved, it is not 100 percent effective at detecting infectious diseases in donors with very early infection. The FDA selected the 12-month deferral to provide adequate time for the detection of infected individuals. 

+


>The FDA guidance “Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products” states, “Defer for 12 months from the most recent sexual contact, a man who has had sex with another man during the past 12 months.” All U.S. blood collection organizations must follow this federal requirement.  



+

>Transgender Donors- Individuals who identify as female and have sex with a man may be eligible to donate blood, if all other blood donation eligibility criteria are applicable. The FDA revised guidance states, “In the context of the donor history questionnaire, FDA recommends that male or female gender be taken to be self-identified and self-reported.” This change allows blood donors to register with the gender in which they identify. The Red Cross will no longer ask donors to answer both male and female questions when attempting to donate. There is no deferral associated with being transgender, and eligibility will be based upon the criteria associated with the gender the donor has reported.

Even more ridiculous, TIFs who have sex with men are turned away...

>Q: I am a trans man, and I have been eligible to donate because my assigned sex at birth was female. However, I have had sex with another man. Can I donate blood?

>A: Individuals who identify as male and have had sex with another man within the past 12 months will be deferred under the MSM policy. 


**Meaning a TIF who has sex with another TIF will be outright banned, but a TIM who has sex with other males won't. According to this new world, biological female-female sex is classified as more of an HIV risk than biological male-male sex.**

The 28% HIV infection figure comes from OP's third source, which was published in 2016 and at the bottom of page 3 said:\n\n ***A 2008 review of HIV studies*** *among transgender women found that, on average, 28 percent tested positive for HIV.*\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the CDC released a new document revising the earlier figures.  The new doc says:\n\n***A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis*** *found that an estimated 14% of transgender women (in the US) have HIV. By race/ethnicity, an estimated 44% of black/African American transgender women, 26% of Hispanic/Latina transgender women, and 7% of white transgender women have HIV.*\n\nThe new document also says that among the 3 million people in the US who were tested for HIV in 2017 and whose results were reported to the CDC,  *the percentage of transgender people who received a new HIV diagnosis was 3 times the national average.*\n\nHowever, the CDC further notes that getting accurate information about HIV rates in the transgender population is made especially difficult for a host of factors, including the fact that people who ID as trans in the US are highly averse to testing: \n\n*Nearly two thirds of transgender women and men surveyed by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2014 and 2015 from 28 jurisdictions reported never testing for HIV.*\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html)"", 'TIMs who have had sex with other men are not allowed to donate blood. Also, TIMs who have injected themselves with any kind of substance (including hormones) *without* prescription are also banned from donating blood (just as all current or former IV drug users). In many cases, TIMs would be barred from donating blood because they are taking too many drugs and hormones. Normally, people who sell sex are not allowed to donate blood either (and this is the group of TIMs that have the highest HIV rate).\n\n(These are the rules in Sweden but many countries, especially in the EU, have the same rules.)', ""They should be banned or the ban for everyone should be lifted. Or have a different LGBT blood pool that anyone can donate too regardless of risk since it's all screened anyway. Donating or getting blood from the LGBT pool would be opt in only."", 'I had a gay friend of mine  in our LGBT+ rights group donate blood once, it was hard but I knew he was sexually active and did not report it to the redcross, I tried to report it anonymously but that didn\'t work.\n\nI had to personally come forward and sign an affidavit stating he was sexually active with a male partner. \n\nI caught a lot of flack for it, ""how could you report him, he just wanted to donate"" they kicked me out, turned my backs on me.\n\nHaving friends turn on me for reporting him was hard but years later he turned up HIV+ after returning from Bali. I know I made the right choice.', 'This is something that genuinely angers me.', 'I was confused about this- from the [American Red Cross](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements/lgbtq-donors.html) blood donation FAQ\n\n\n> The FDA revised guidance states, “In the context of the donor history questionnaire, FDA recommends that male or female gender be taken to be self-identified and self-reported.” This change allows blood donors to register with the gender in which they identify. The Red Cross will no longer ask donors to answer both male and female questions when attempting to donate. There is no deferral associated with being transgender, and eligibility will be based upon the criteria associated with the gender the donor has reported. See additional blood donation eligibility criteria.\n\n\nIf I am reading this correctly- this means Gay TiMs would *not* be considered MSM (men who have sex with men), because they identify as women? That seems like a poorly thought out policy. \n\n\nAnd for TiFs, does this mean they are not going to ask women-specific questions like, “have you ever been pregnant?”. Because that is something that can have real health consequences for recipients.\n\n\nI personally have no idea how exogenous hormones in blood impact recipients, I’d be really interested in hearing from anyone who knows about that.', '""Have you taken a dick in the butt in the last year?"" and ""Have you recently had sex with a man who has been in jail?"" should be added.\n\nThis is one of those things where public safety comes before feelings. This is also one of those things where people need to police their own.\n\nFor every gay dude who is super offended that he can\'t donate blood, there are three gay dudes engaged in appallingly promiscuous behavior. For the kiddies who were too young at the time, read about the arguments over closing the bath houses. Some gay men do consider anonymous, promiscuous sex to be a cornerstone of what it means to be a gay man.', ""You're fucking kidding me, right? I've been barred from giving blood in the US because I've spent some time in the exotic land of... Europe."", 'I honestly feel like there is a much bigger risk with TIM/TIF blood than just HIV/AIDS.\n\nBecause majority are on hormones that would likely have an affect on the recipients as it would be higher levels than a regular person.\n\nAlso I imagine they would insist or go ‘stealth’ so the blood would go the the same ‘gender’ as them rather than same sex. Which could have huge complications. Especially as its recently been found it can kill males to get female blood.\n\nIf they’ve had SRS they often have infections too.\n\nUltimately they shouldn’t be allowed to donate as it’s a waste of resources.', ""This is insane. That a medical organization has been so swayed by identity politics is unbearable. I realize that people are ridiculous about these things when they're arguing online, but somehow imagine that at the end of the day, facing reality, they'll be rational. But this is serious stuff. WTF is going on..."", 'JFC.', '[deleted]', ""I can't believe the gay press isn't having kittens over this. I remember how much ink was spent on it years ago. There really is no gay press anymore-- trans 've bought them all out."", 'Would someone donating blood be asked to ID as a TIM?', 'Also blood is never given out without the rigorous screening and typing process. I think someone may have heard about emergency release units and got confused. We typically release (O neg) units in the event of a severe trauma or otherwise deemed emergent situation, but that is only AFTER the testing is done for diseases at the blood processing facilities (red Cross/lifesouth) and has arrived on our hospital shelves. Testing is only ever ""skipped"" when it\'s presented as a life or death situation, and that is only for donor/recipient compatibility testing which is always started asap, usually while the unit is being hung for transfusion, so the compatibility testing still gets done and recorded, even in these emergencies.', 'Each unit is tested individually. Notice the test tubes they collect during donation? Those are actually what the type and testing are done on. They all have the same ID # on them and they are tagged or discarded based on the single unit. Also if you test positive for any infections pathogen, you are immediately notified and deferred from any future donations.', 'The amount of misinformation in the donation/transfusion process in this thread is what terrifies me.', 'That is up to the Red Cross to decide how they want to treat it. The CDC and the FDA make the guidelines and it is up to the facilities to decide where they stand. That is why I was surprised to read that gay, bisexual, or transgender men were allowed to donate at all.  The places I go to defer you if you ever admit to sleeping with a gay man now matter the orientation. \n\nThese are sections from the CDC and FDA study that make the guidelines. \n\nWill blood establishments be required to adopt these new recommendations?\nBlood establishments typically revise their existing standard operating procedures regarding donor deferral following issuance of final FDA guidance on the matter. However, establishments may voluntarily elect more stringent donor deferral criteria than those required or recommended by the FDA.\n\nIf a blood establishment chooses to implement the recommended changes, the establishment should appropriately modify its donor educational material and donor history questionnaire as outlined in the guidance, including full-length and abbreviated questionnaires. \n\n\nThe term transgender is not apart of the specifications when the CDC says: \n\n6.Male donors previously deferred because of a history of sex with another man, even one time, since 1977, may be eligible to donate provided that they have not had sex with another man during the past 12 months and they meet all other donor eligibility criteria.\n\n7. Male donors deferred because of a history of sex with another man in the past 12 months may be eligible to donate provided they have not had sex with another man during the past 12 months and they meet all other donor eligibility criteria.\n\n8. Female donors deferred because of a history of sex in the past 12 months with a man who has had sex with another man in the past 12 months may be eligible to donate provided that during the past 12 months the female donors have not had sex with a man who has had sex with another man in the past 12 months and the female donors meet all other donor eligibility criteria.\n\n\n\n\nThe language used in the ruling states that only biological gender is the determining factor that is why I added the biological part Hence this excerpt here. \n\nThe term male-to-male sexual contact is used in CDC surveillance systems. It indicates a behavior that transmits HIV infection, not how individuals self-identify in terms of their sexuality. \n\nIt also tells you here that the self identification for a transgender individual is only for the questioner. \n\nHow do the recommendations apply to transgender individuals?\nThe FDA’s recommendation to blood establishments is that in the context of the donor history questionnaire, male or female gender should be self-identified and self-reported for the purpose of blood donation.\n\nIf the OP wants to donate they most definitely can. You may have to say you are a biological female at the American Red Cross due to their rules but you can.  There are like 4,000 different donation places and I am sure you can find one that follow this stuff to the letter. They have to go thru a bunch of stuff In order to make changes to the base recommendations and then the actual laws. \nRevisions of your own donor educational materials, DHQ and accompanying materials must be submitted to FDA as a prior approval supplement (PAS) under 21 CFR 601.12(b).\n\nI also know that is not exactly fair to identify as something if you are not. It is like someone calling me a female when I am a male. \nI am sorry that you are getting deferred when you are a viable donation. There needs to be more people that donate no matter what the gender.  Just please keep in mind , Do not lie to donate. If you are an individual that has a question in your mind about it you are clean,  don’t risk the worlds safety over this. That is not just for transgender women who have an insanely high risk factor but everyone. \n\nIn all honesty after looking at this stuff I would take a transgender man over a transgender woman to donate anytime. The statistical risk is insane. With that being said there has only been a  .25% of blood that made it thru to storage from individuals that are not supposed to be donating. They do any amazingly good job at keeping the the blood and plasma stores safe. \n\nIf you would like to see it all spelled out in painstaking detail with reference material and not just the clips I have taken look this up. \n\nRevised Recommendations for\nReducing the Risk of Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus Transmission\nby Blood and Blood products \nGuidance for Industry\nAdditional copies of this guidance are available from the Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (OCOD), 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Rm. 3128, Silver Spring, MD 20993- 0002, or by calling 1-800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010, or email ocod@fda.hhs.gov, or from the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guida nces/default.htm.', ""I think we should test everyone first, not judge them based on gender/sexuality.

ce4eit,ce4eit,My brother is a TIM and he’s violating my privacy and boundaries,"So I’m just gonna start this off by saying that I’m going to keep some of the details purposefully vague so my brother can’t prove this is me. Anyways, my brother is a TIM who has been transitioning for a couple of years now. I’ll call him Jack. Before Jack started transitioning, I would sometimes find articles of my clothing in his room, but I never thought much about it. Because you know, who assumes that their family member is stealing and wearing their clothes? I just assumed I accidentally left them in there or that my mom put the wrong clothes in his room after doing laundry.

&#x200B;

At first, Jack came out to me as a crossdresser. I was fully supportive of him because I did, and still do, believe that gendered clothing and gender roles are bullshit. A few months later, he came out to me as a transgender “girl.” Luckily for him, I was a bit of a libfem, so of course I accepted him for the “brave and stunning woman” he was.

&#x200B;

I started going on transgender subreddits to try to understand what Jack might be going through so I could be a better ally. Oh, how that backfired. I began to notice that there were several problems in the transgender community. In particular, there were the overly sexual, fetishy nature of several posts, TIMs getting upset that lesbians didn’t want their “girl dick,” and several TIMs saying they wanted periods and were jealous of women for experiencing them (I have endometriosis and suffered heavily throughout adolescence so that pissed me right off). The thing that broke the camel’s back and made me reach peak trans were all the posts about TIMs wearing their female relatives’ clothing. Even more than that was the lack of anyone calling them out for their creepy behavior. I think I only saw one post where the replies were slightly negative, and in that one the TIM admitted to masturbating in his sister’s clothing.

&#x200B;

Discovering this made me realize that maybe Jack’s reasons for transitioning weren’t as wholesome as I had imagined. I started thinking back on it, and it suddenly clicked. I realized, holy shit, that little creep has been wearing my clothing and doing god knows what else. I felt violated, but I didn’t have any proof to accuse him. So I started paying closer attention. I started doing the laundry for my mom to ensure my clothes went to my room, and sure enough, my clothes still somehow ended up in Jack’s room. I sometimes even found my underwear in his room… I also noticed my makeup and skincare products would constantly be out of place. One time I even found my Vaseline I use for my dry skin in his room (ugh I don’t even want to fucking think about why it could’ve been in there). One day, I found my razor absolutely covered in long brown hair. I’m not a brunette and I’m not hairy, so I knew it wasn’t me.

&#x200B;

I finally had enough and accused him of using my things and told him to stop because he was violating my boundaries. He got really mad and said he wasn’t doing anything. He even denied the razor, despite the fact that he was the only person it could have been. After that confrontation, I started hiding all my stuff in my room and keeping a close eye on it. Two times during that period I woke up in the middle of the night to find Jack trying to break into my stuff. It was horrifying and I could hardly believe what I was seeing. He apologized profusely both times and promised he wouldn’t do it again. I was pissed, but for some reason I didn’t tell anyone. It felt like nobody would believe me, it was just so fucking bizarre. After that, I started locking the door to my room. I didn’t feel safe in my own home anymore.

&#x200B;

Now he has moved out (thank god), but he still comes by to visit sometimes. I feel wary when he’s around, and if I forget to put my things away in my room, I notice that he still messes with it. He also has a habit of “play” touching me a lot, even though I’ve told him several times that I don’t like it and that he needs to stop. He says that I’m just overreacting.

&#x200B;

The worst part of all this is that I let him get away with all the things that he’s done. It’s like he has this power over me because I can’t say anything lest I be labelled transphobic… I don’t even know what to do anymore.

&#x200B;

Oh and a side note: I asked him why he wanted to transition, and he said because he wants huge tits, likes wearing dresses, and wants to be the girlfriend in a relationship. 😐

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My brother is a TIM, he wears my clothes, uses my makeup and other things without my permission. He also broke into my room a couple of times while I was sleeping trying to get into my things.

cqmzxe,cqmzxe,"Older radfems, you are appreciated by the next generation.","Hi GenderCritical, I am radfembaby, a 16 year old girl of colour who over the last year has left liberal feminism and become a radical feminist. 

Why, you may ask? 

* From the beginning of last year, a school friend of mine who has recently transitioned from female to male, and her friends have been harassing me and labelling me transphobic, simply because I declined the option to go on a date with them. 

*My lesbian and bisexual friends have been helping me emotionally, since I struggle with my own sexuality and romantic attractions. One of them, with good intentions, mentioned my feelings to a gay male teacher of mine, who pulled me for a discussion. He told me that there is nothing wrong with how I’m feeling, encouraged me to discover my feelings and carefully introduced me to trans ideology. He believed because I deviate between ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ clothing styles, that perhaps I was figuring out my gender identity, He asked me whether I think I was born in the wrong body and because of my own body dysmorphia(I am very curvy and developed quickly) and hatred of my menstrual cycle(abnormally heavy, combined with debilitating pain), I started to believe so.

*I truly started to believe maybe I was trans, and in research of FTMs and MTFs(I’m sorry, I get confused with TiM and TiF) I realised that just because there is a part of me who is perhaps more stereotypically masculine/tomboyish, it doesn’t mean I must be a boy or change my body. I also have other issues with pornography, prostitution and sex positivity, that align with many of your own beliefs here. I hated the idea that my lesbian friends, who were attracted physically to girls and their bodies, felt like that if they didn’t want to date someone with a penis or who were born as males,  were transphobic and in that moment, I denounced TRA ideology.

I quickly wanted to say that you are appreciated. In my own discovery of you all, I started sharing things with my friends, who readily accepted radical feminism and shared with their friends. Groups of up to 60 of us lurk on here and laugh, simply because the thoughts and feelings we had all along are okay! 

From all of us, we say thank you. The younger generation of teenage human females aren’ t standing down and we operate in love for ourselves and not hatred for others.

Back in the mid 1980s a male friend of mine made me go to Dorothy Perkins with him, and do the buying of the girl's shirt he wanted. (it had flowers, men's shirts weren't as interesting he said). I wore Doc Marten's for years - boys not mens cos they didn't do them for women then.  \n\n\n\\- YOU are beautiful. You and your friends. The body you are born in will age (dis) gracefully as you do. You don't have to live up to or 'win' instagram or anything else. Be the best You, that YOU can be. We are supposed to be different, with different likes and dislikes, our own opinions, our own distinctive features (else how to recognise each other!)\n\n\\- Winning at life means treating others as you would like to be treated, putting the good of society as a whole ahead of one's own wishes (ie don't speed drive or drink drive others may be hurt, think of them ahead of the urge for speed that sort of thing), and being kind to yourself and kind to others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may at a later stage in life decide you wish to undergo surgery to remove the outward manifestations of being the sex you were born, but we as humans can only do this because the medical science has advanced enough, but it's painful, it's not possible to become the other sex fully, and really really needs a LOT of thought and working through any other issues in life before embarking upon.  \n\n\nso I'd say, now is the time to try different things (as long as they're safe and legal, generally laws against stuff is because they've been seen to cause harm) whilst you are young and growing up.

bhamvt,bhamvt,Just stumbled across this sub and I’m glad I did. When I was a minor I was shaken up by a creepy encounter with a man twice my age. Posted about it to 2X to get support and all I got was a bunch of males shaming me and sticking up for him. I feel vindicated and safe in this sub.,"So the gist of the original story is that a man twice my age approached me in a parking lot because he wanted to talk about the cool car I was driving. I made some small talk with him about it, and then I tried to leave. He got really sexual and I made it clear I was a 17 year old and NOT interested in him. I made it explicitly clear. I also told him I had a boyfriend (which I did). He told me he was in his 30s and that I needed to try out an older man because he saw nothing wrong with me being 17. He said it wasn’t fair that I looked so much older. He asked me about 4 different ways for my number. He tried to get me to get in his car to “go for a ride”. I told him that I didn’t like it, and my dad and boyfriend sure as hell wouldn’t. Anyway, it just escalated and he just kept begging for me to “give him a chance” and he got creepier and more sexual. I got home that night and found him on Instagram and Facebook and found that he has several small children, including daughters, and a girlfriend. I blocked him on all platforms just to be safe. Never once was I a tease. He was the one who got gross really fast and wanted to talk about everything but cars. 

So I was pretty shaken up by the whole encounter and I thought I could get some support over on 2x chromosomes because I figured they supported young girls who look way older who get preyed on by older men. Boy was I wrong. I don’t think one female commented, it was just a barrage of attacks from men. Claiming that it’s not their fault that I’m in my sexual prime and it’s just human nature to be sexually attracted to almost legal girls. They said I was a tease and I had no right to be upset by the encounter. They said nothing would’ve happened. It was all my fault apparently. Then the “NoT aLl MeN” comments came. It turned into such a charlie foxtrot that I just deleted whole entire post. 

Anyway that was my realization that that sub is a toxic wasteland that does not support women. It was just men whining and turning themselves into the victims. It disgusted me.

cji40f,cji40f,My sister has moved out,"I thought I'd end the night with a rave since I've had a pretty ranty day (and have a few more rants stored up) to celebrate a little victory! 

My younger sister has moved out of the very patriarchal, religious family home. She's rejecting the idea that she should pass from her father's home and control to her husband's and is establishing her own financial independence. 

When I did this, I was the *only* woman in my family and the first to do so, well now a trickle has become a flood and my younger siblings and female family members (some, not all) are pushing back against the misogyny they are taught and leaving home to do it if they need to.  And the path is just that slight bit easier for them, because it has been trodden on just a little, left enough of a trail to soften the shit - just a little. 

And I am now in a position to help her, which is the most wonderful feeling. I remember my a previous schoolteacher of mine who I am still in touch with and who was a great radfem mentor to me told me years ago that I will one day pay her kindness forward to another woman. Today, it is wonderful to have the opportunity to be able to do that. That is the power and beauty of female friendships and support networks in a world which often seems to have gone completely mental <3

bb4bpv,bb4bpv,"Men and their hate for ""basic"" women/culture. Shocked at how irate they get about it.","This has been bothering me for a long time, but it really put me over the edge when I saw a thread about dating, and how one user would ""get up and leave"" if he went home with a woman and saw a ""Live, Laugh, Love poster."" I shouldn't have expanded the comments, but I did, and holy hell. I expected maybe a couple goofy comments in agreement, remarking on how cliche the ""live/laugh/love"" phrase is... but I was wrong. By the way they were speaking of these women, you'd have thought they just committed a shooting spree of puppies and kittens. Pure, unabashed hatred. One guy said these women make him lose his faith in a humanity. Another said people (women) who are basic should have been aborted (phrased differently, I think).

These men were so angry by a harmless meme decorating a woman's living room; you can't tell me that her being a woman had no effect on their *decision* to hate it. Can you imagine being enraged by the likes and habits of other women, when they're just minding their own business? She doesn't deserve your hate when she gets a feather or an infinity symbol tattooed on her body. She doesn't deserve your hate if she decides to wear yoga pants or sip on her pumpkin spice latte. She doesn't deserve your hate for wearing high-waisted pants or getting her hair in a bob. All you men who hate on women for their ""crimes"" are just trying to distract from the fact that *your* sex is the one committing all the *actual* atrocities in this world.

We can never win in the eyes of men. We are either too ditzy, too cliche, too vocally-fried, too loud, too gossipy/catty, too superficial, too intimidating, too ""feisty."" It doesn't matter what we do, as women, because men are going to find a way to hate it.

cz5o88,cz5o88,"When trans activists try to falsely equate gender identity & sex, they make it impossible for women to speak about why sex matters without causing offense (and then women are punished for being mean, nasty, hurting people's feelings)","I posted this on Twitter yesterday and wanted to share here where it's easier to have more of a conversation about it.

&#x200B;

Hurt feelings and offense-taking play a big role in shutting down, censoring, and redirecting conversations about just about everything to do with women these days: abortion rights, period stigma, and your basic uterus-having, sex-based anything and everything. The idea seems to be that rather than make some people uncomfortable, offend them by reminding them of what their bodies are not, it's better to fudge the truth, censor ourselves by using the latest ""approved"" language (always shifting, mind you, and so impossible to satisfy), or, better yet, be quiet. Here's the thing. 

Women, doesn't it hurt and offend us when our inescapable reality -- being female and all that entails -- is dismissed and womanhood is reduced to an identity or a feeling? 

It's hurtful to me, as a woman, when trans activists suggest that women can identify out of sex-based oppression because neither sex nor oppression works like that. 

It's offensive to me, as a woman, when I am told that my abortion isn't a ""women's"" issue anymore, but transwomen's feelings are. 

It's offensive to me, as a woman, when I am told that women should not speak about the basis of our oppression -- our sex -- and center sex-based oppression in our own liberation movement. 

(What other liberation movement faces such pressure to sideline its own issues and analysis? Why would the movement to liberate women and girls be expected to focus on anything but liberation of women and girls in the first place? What could gendered socialization/expectations tell us about this?)

It's frankly dehumanizing to see that so many people think of women not as full and equal human beings but as mash-ups of sexist gender stereotypes, available for appropriation. This strikes me as deeply misogynistic and dismissive of women's realities. 

That hurts! Hurt and offense = definitely a two-way street here. But I don't have a right not have my feelings hurt or a right not to be offended. I don't have a right to police other people's speech -- much less their perceptions and thoughts -- to ensure that others don't hurt my feelings. No one has that right. 

People are entitled to their beliefs -- and let's be clear: gender ID, gendered brains, gendered souls, these are beliefs -- but no one is entitled to dictate others' beliefs or compel others' speech to affirm or assuage their own ideas about themselves.

If someone says, ""I am the same as you and when you speak about your experiences and make it clear that we are in fact different in ways that matter that hurts and invalidates me,"" how do you speak without offending such a person? You can't. Demands that women police their own speech so as not to hurt trans people's feelings SILENCE WOMEN. There is no way to talk about why & how sex matters to women's lives without running afoul of the woke thought police. How can you avoid hurting the feelings of a person who is making unreasonable claims (like ""I am a woman because I say so"") and demands (""therefore, all women's spaces and services should be open to me and women's movements should center my issues"") at the expense of your rights?

It's unreasonable to demand that women's movements include (much less center) transwomen and tactfully downplay (to the point of falsifying) sex-based oppression that constrains and deforms the lives of women and girls here and around the globe.

By trying to equate sex and gender identity, rather than advocate for protections for transgender people as transgender people, **trans activists have made it impossible for women to speak about their experiences of sex-based oppression without threatening the house of cards that is innate gender identity.**

(I don't think this is an accident, do you? I think they've framed the debate in such a way that women will look bad because women stepping out of line, standing up to males, and setting boundaries leaves a bad taste in many people's mouths.) 

That matters because sex matters. Here in the US, women's rights to bodily autonomy/self-determination and self-definition as a protected class are under unprecedented attack. When it comes to abortion bans that were just signed into law in states like Georgia and Alabama, if these laws ultimately stand, women will have fewer rights to bodily integrity than a corpse. At the same time, the Equality Act - recently passed by House Dems - would hollow out sex-based protections that women and girls still need by redefining sex to include gender identity, sex stereotypes, and ""mannerisms."" Bye-bye, women's shelters, women's sports, etc.

Women need to be able to talk about this! But too many on the Left are more committed to policing women's speech than protecting women's rights. 

In order to stand up for women's rights, we need to be able to define women, name the basis of our oppression (sex), and speak about the issues that affect us on the basis of our sex. Gender identity puts women in a position where we have only two options: roll over and lose rights and spaces women and girls need, or say no and cause offense. 

We're going to keep saying: ""Woman"" isn't a feeling. That's not who we are. That's not how sex-based oppression works. No, we won't stop talking about sex. No, you can't take away our rights, our language, our spaces. This isn't OK. There are other ways to protect trans people's rights that don't require trampling women's.

Until we can agree that sex and gender identity are different kinds, women won't be able to speak about our interests and needs without speaking in ways that will offend trans activists who are committed to erasing the real differences that exist. But we need to keep talking. We need to be honest about each group's experiences, interests, and needs -- where those converge, where they diverge. Creating space for honesty about our differences is how we figure this out.",484,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

I wasn't mean in my response. I just said that if he's allowed to not be interested men **under any circumstances** (his wording), then so are lesbians. I said he's not having luck because he's barking up the wrong tree, and that lots of straight girls would probably give him a shot. (I also made a point to avoid using pronouns so as not to seem rude.)

In those sorts of places, it is typically common courtesy to point out to someone if they are missing something *obvious*/or are making a deal-breaking mistake in their dating profiles, especially in situations where this oversight is most likely contributing to them not getting dates & remaining ""forever alone."" Now, although it is true that the OP of this thread could have worded her particular comment less condescendingly, her message does have value for someone like you who apparently feels ""forever alone."" I will try to rephrase her point in a way that may be more accessible to you, with a dual aim of both a) helping you out and b) helping lesbians, so that we can get woman-identified male suitors like you off of our back: \n\nThe word ""lesbian"" has historically and socially been used to refer to female people who are *exclusively* interested in dating other female people. It is only in the past 5 years or so that some queer communities have started to use the word differently. The recent, ""queer"" usage of ""lesbian"" to mean ""woman who is attracted to anyone who *identifies* as a woman, **regardless of whether the woman-identified partner is male or female**"" is not something that mainstream society is familiar with, and it is certainly *not* something that most lesbians are on board with. Just because you choose to use the word differently than its historical usage & might find it empowering to do so does not mean that others, particularly lesbians, are also using the word ""lesbian"" the same way you are when we are looking for dates. Homosexual women are not *capable* of feeling attraction to any male person, regardless of whether the person identifies as a man or a woman or anything else. *Nothing* can change that- not hormones, not surgery, not any personality trait(s), nor the most earnest efforts on the part of the lesbian to change her sexuality to include woman-identified males. The only chance a transwoman has at dating a ""lesbian"" is to date a bisexual woman who self-identifies as a ""lesbian"" (but in reality that woman must be genuinely capable of feeling attraction to both male and female bodies, and she also must be aroused by the thought of sex with a person who has both male and female sex characteristics- and no genuinely homosexual woman can feel this desire). \n\nI am telling you this so that you can consider ""re-marketing"" yourself in a way that will lead to more success in your dating life. By continuing to call yourself a lesbian, you are probably causing dozens of frustrated lesbians to click on and immediately have to exit your profile the minute they see your picture (which is obviously a male person). And, as many commenters in this thread have stated, apparently you are quite an attractive feminine male (as a lesbian, I find myself struggling to determine whether a given male is attractive in any case, which is admittedly an odd limitation of mine that most other lesbians don\'t seem to share). So it\'s a real shame that you insist on ""barking up the wrong tree"" so to speak, because regardless of how objectively attractive you might be to some women, you are simply not going to find dating success (and you are going to continue to piss lesbians off) if you continue to try to date the sole, *tiny* fraction of human female people that is legitimately **incapable** of feeling attraction to you, under any circumstances (that includes hormones, surgery, etc...) If you accept this and choose to ""brand"" yourself more accurately in the dating world, you will find more success. I understand how ""heterosexual"" might not feel authentic for you given your journey, but perhaps ""queer transwoman"" is a good fit to describe your situation as a MtF person who is exclusively seeking female partners? That way, you don\'t have to trigger your own dysphoria when you go on dating websites, but you also don\'t have to disrespect lesbian dating sites by adding more profiles of male people that we, as homosexual women, have 0 shot at finding a compatible match in (you are far from the only MtF these days who is calling themselves a ""lesbian"" and frankly bombarding *tiny* lesbian communities to the point where we are outnumbered by MtFs in a solid % of our spaces).\n\nAt least consider it. Alliances are a two-way street, and your community has been deeply disrespecting the L. Stop contributing to the problem.', ""Honestly if they're going to continue chanting TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN until my ears go numb, we should just chant everywhere we go:\n\nLESBIANS DON'T LIKE DICK\n\nLESBIANS DON'T LIKE DICK\n\nLESBIANS DON'T LIKE DICK\n\nLESBIANS DON'T LIKE DICK\n\nREPEAT AFTER ME: *LESBIANS DON'T LIKE DICK*"", 'He looks like a man with that skin smoothing snapchat filter on, he would probably look even more manly in person.\n\nI’m sure most of the people downvoting just see it as you telling a disfigured person they’d have trouble dating - it’s true, but mean to say so.

bjvhjv,bjvhjv,Transing children is literally abuse,"I just discovered a podcast called ""How to be a girl"" which is made by a mother who has a son that she is turning into a girl. I've been listening to an old episode about motherhood. It's beyond disturbing and I honestly feel so bad for her son, he's only 8. The mother keeps going on about how she wishes there was a way for her ""daughter"" to remain fertile as though it's just inevitable he'll be infertile. I just can't imagine changing my child's body in such a way.

I don't even remember being 8 and I can imagine I had some ridiculous ideas about the world that shouldn't have been indulged. My mother was abusive and I can only imagine that if the transgender trend had been a thing when I was growing up that she might have persuaded me into it. She brought me up very gender neutral anyway and I did struggle with my body and being a woman  (don't we all!).

The podcast is her main source of income which makes the whole thing even shadier cos what if her son wakes up tomorrow and realises he is actually a boy and wants to live as a boy. That's their whole livelihood down the drain. I haven't seen any concern about this podcast online and I'm honestly just so shocked

Edit: She also records her conversations with her son and I just find it so creepy. There's a scene (scene? Idk what to call it) where she's getting her son ready for bed and she's talking about his stuffed animals on the bed. She literally says ""are you their mother?"" And he just says ""I consider them my babies"".

At one point he finds out he won't be able to have children if he wants to be a girl and says ""I'll have to be gay and adopt a baby"" to which his mum says ""no no we've talked about this"". It's clearly all her and I feel for this child so deeply, I actually feel like someone needs to call children's services.

b5qysi,b5qysi,Spoke to my pornfree male friend today who is newly married and it showed me how much porn has ruined marital sex and commitment,"He has never been into watching porn and doesn't believe its good for people. He is also greek orthodox and stayed a virgin till marriage voluntarily. He says every time his wife takes her clothes off (even just to change) everything in his brain explodes and its the most beautiful thing in the world and he appreciates it. Whenever she wants sex its this incredible gift he sees as her giving him and he will never push her for it. He respects her more than ive ever seen a man respect a woman in my life.

It just makes me so sad seeing this though compared to my pornsick male friends who see women as disposable or just another source of pleasure out of many. It saddens me to see the way men neglect their wives in favor of porn or prostitutes or cheating because theres no longer this value to sex and what it means. When I brought up kink to him he was disgusted and asked me why people cant have fulfilling sex lives with the act of sex itself. It is just sad that porn gets more and more degrading and so does the way men are treating women today, especially the ones theyre supposed to protect.

Edit: because some people are missing the point, this isnt about ""being a virgin till marriage."" His wife had quite a few partners before him. This is about relationships when youre pornfree.

Her and her husband had three kids together. Their sex life was, and still is, nonexistent because he is addicted to porn. And she had many different conversations with me where she straight up said that her husband couldn’t keep it up with her because not only did she not look like the women in porn, but she wasn’t willing to do the things that women in porn do. It’s really sad. \n\nA different scenario. When I was in my late teens, I knew a girl who was seventeen and was in a relationship with a man who was thirty. They lived together and everything. Now, from a gross male perspective, she was so beautiful. She HAD the “body of a pornstar”, to be blunt. From the dudes perspective, he was living the dream. He was an average looking guy who had a mediocre life, who basically had someone who looked like a teen porn star living with him and willing to have sex with him.

I remember an infamous pro-rad fem guy that passionately argued on behalf of feminism and against porn was outed by his girlfriend to be looking at porn...and he openly admitted he has a problem with being addicted to it (even though he's against it)...I still actually respect him and the work he did as a person, but I wouldn't want to be his girlfriend. \n\nThat being said, I've dated a couple of pro-feminist men, only one of them being specifically pro-rad fem and involved in the movement. My sexual experiences with the pro-rad fem guy (who is an outspoken advocate against porn) were very intense...he was extremely, extremely attentive and very excited, which led me to feel like it was due to him saving himself all for me, instead of jerking off to porn. But then again, there were some questionable things he did in our relationship...he seemed to really enjoy the attention of other radfem women (and women, we really do tend to uphold and admire these guys more than we should...they are men at the end of the day) and he wasn't emotionally attentive or thoughtful or respectful enough, as well as some other sexual issues where he seemed opportunist and emotionally pushy and overly consumed with getting sex...by the time our relationship ended, I felt used...just as I usually feel with all men....but I actually felt worse because I felt disillusioned and played.

c5wdjk,c5wdjk,Men Blaming Women For Being Cautious & Hurting Their Feelings,"There is a meme on the frontpage about men being paranoid about walking behind women and feeling creepy. The comments are predictably tiring. The total lack of empathy towards women for some reason still shocks me sometimes.

&#x200B;

How hard is it to take five seconds to ask - why do these women act this way? Men can be creepy. Woman deal with creepy guys all the time. Instead of getting mad at women for being suspicious of men how about men call out men, huh? Stop men from this behavior and women wouldn't have to keep themselves safe all the goddamn time.

&#x200B;

But then I saw this top comment and I just knew it was going to get worse. 5.4K Karma + Silver for a woman apologizing to men.

&#x200B;

>Real talk tho, do guys actually think like this? As a girl, I do tend to be overly aware of the people around me and get a little worried about creeps following me. But do guys worry they may seem creepy just because they’re walking behind someone? If so, **I’m sorry, and I hope we can all feel less worried about these things in the future.**

Which leads to other women apologizing:

>""**This is hilarious**, yet so so sad. **I’m sorry men carry this burden...and I’m sorry we women give you this burden** because we carry the burden of feeling unsafe. I wish the world could be a nicer place for us all so we could stop all this **misguided worry.** Same with guys hanging out at the park. It’s such shit that so many guys feel they can’t even go to the park if they go alone because they fear looking creepy around kids. Some times seeing/hearing children in all their innocent fun and unbridled laughter is so pure and wholesome and there’s no shame in enjoying that while you sit down to eat your lunch or chill after a walk. **One persons misguided ego quickly extinguishes another persons innocent intentions 😞""**

And even more women:

>""As a woman, it makes me sad when I read that decent guys have to worry about being perceived as a creep just because they happen to be going about their business when a woman is nearby who happens to be alone. **I promise not all women are OMG HE'S FOLLOWING ME but I do understand that men have to protect themselves from potentially misunderstood situations as well.""**

&#x200B;

Men. Have. To. Protect. Themselves. From. Potentially. Misunderstood. Situations.

How about this alternative thought:

WOMEN HAVE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM MEN

And all women should be like 'omg he's following me', because being a woman in the world is fucking dangerous and you should try to keep y'allselves safe. I hate the apologizing. Men don't deserve apologies for this. Women deserve apologies for being unable to just live life peacefully.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And of course once conversation about women being \~unjustly paranoid\~ starts and women validate that shit, men feel more comfortable in their complaints.

>""A similar situation plays out at the gym often. I'll be using a machine next to a woman and she finishes up and leaves. Then when I'm ready to move to something else it happens to be next to the machine she is now using. **I can't go use the machine I was planning to because it will seem like I'm following her around the gym.""**

Boo. Fucking. Hoo. Maybe, if men didn't actually do shit like this, women wouldn't be so cautious about that type of behavior!!! He wouldn't be inconvenienced, if he called out men doing shit like that! No one is like - ""It sucks women have to take so many precautions to keep themselves safe. They can't even go to the gym without being mindful of who is around.""

&#x200B;

>""At work, end of the day, I grab an empty elevator down and a woman gets on from a lower floor. We both exit the building, we both start walking the only possible route to the closest subway station on a packed sidewalk on one of the busiest streets in the country. I'm holding back to give her personal space because the sidewalk is too crowded for me to walk past without cutting off someone walking in the opposite direction.  
>  
>**Suddenly she slows down, looks over her shoulder, makes eye contact with me, clutches her purse to her chest, and sprints away in high heels.**  
>  
>There were probably hundreds of pedestrians and a hundred cars that could see that stretch of wide open sidewalk on this bright summer afternoon, **yet she felt I was so creepy walking the only possible path between our shared office and the subway station that she felt the need to protect her purse and run in heels?""**

ITS NOT PERSONAL. Its about the potential men have to be dangerous, because most women if not all women have a wealth of experiences that tell this is what they have to do. How come no one is like ""Wow. Men have must of done some really awful things to her. We should try to police the dangerous behavior of men more and support women so they can feel safe in public.""

&#x200B;

Nah people just reply shit like:

>""**That's 100% her problem.** You did nothing wrong and should not feel ashamed or ""creepy"" in any way.""

&#x200B;

And then when you think that maybe there might be some semblance of sanity with comments like:

>As a man, it makes me sad that there are so many assholes in the world that make it so women do not feel safe walking around.

Comments like this get even more upvotes:

>Same. **But I wonder how much of that is because of the media.** The internet brings every story in the world into every home. Used to be we only heard about shit that happened locally, now we get to be freaked out by assholes and creeps from the other side of the world too.

&#x200B;

Women's concerns can't be legitimate. They must have just read some scary news on the internet. Women could be raised without knowing bad things happen women and still display the same cautious behavior, because we don't need to be told about something we fucking experience regularly!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But then of course reddit can't be reddit without some good old fashion women hating.

&#x200B;

We have conversations like this:

>""It's much telling about the times we live in. Like bosses not meeting female employees 1 on 1 anymore.""  
>  
>""That's bullshit, but what is more bullshit is I know it happens""

&#x200B;

With Responses Like This:

>""As someone who is an example of the above, it's bullshit but female employees going to HR whenever they feel like they got slighted is even more bullshit when it causes your team to get called for individual interviews. A male never going closed-door 1 on 1 is an absolutely smart move. If it's sensitive and you have to close the door, you bring a same-level or higher manager with you. ""

&#x200B;

And This:

>""It happens because the culture has decided you don't need evidence to ruin a person's livelihood. You just need a vagina. **Men who don't protect themselves like this are stupid. The world is perfectly ok with destroying your life for the high crime of making any woman uncomfortable for a second.**""

&#x200B;

And This Absolutely Lovely Exchange:

>""My VP is female. She refuses to have closed door meetings with any of the males in the office for the sake of 'propriety'.""  
>  
>""Glad to see Victorian morals returning to our world.""  
>  
>""Gonna have to start bringing a set of pearls to work.""  
>  
>**""I'm going to have to keep my daughters home from now on, just to be safe. It shouldn't be too hard to arrange some marriages for them as long as I provide a suitable dowry.""**  
>  
>""I am a citizen and land owner. Perhaps we could make an arrangement. How many goats could you provide?""

Maybe the VP just has had enough bullshit with men that she is keeping herself safe. Yeah lets just mock that by joking about girls being property.

&#x200B;

All of these comments having ample amounts of upvotes to boot.

&#x200B;

So what have we learned here? Men are the victims. Women have nothing to fear, but men do. Were statistics discussed? No. Was it a group therapy session for men with women coming out to validate male feelings? Yes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I would like to share a personal story about the last time I was guilt tripped into thinking I was being too cautious with men. It was a Friday in late 2016, when I thought I would go and do some video game shopping by myself. That day I was in a good mood. I was feeling relaxed and confident. The store was empty except for a man a bit older than me working at the checkout desk. I thought I would ask him for advice and help with my purchase. Normally I would just look stern and use my phone to get all the information I need, but that day I thought ""He works here for a reason! Don't be so paranoid."" I asked him questions. He helped me get what I needed. I made some small talk and generally tried to be open minded about trusting a strange man to not be a creep. I wasn't flirting. I was wearing sweat pants, an oversized shirt, and my hair was a mess. No makeup. I just was being nice and polite. I simply wanted information. All was good. I left the store. Goods obtained. He didn't ask for my number. He didn't follow me out of the store. See being nice and trusting with men isn't so bad.

&#x200B;

Three months later a stranger adds me on facebook. I accepted thinking I just forgot who that person was considering I am pretty difficult to find on social media. Its the clerk. He used my credit card information to find me. It took him three months. He wanted to date me. I turned him down. He then kept pursuing me for a more casual relationship. A guy I was nice to for 15 minutes spent three months looking for me, so we could sleep together. I felt so creeped out and unsafe. I use cash now for all purchases.

&#x200B;

I have many, many creepy men stories. :) But thats the last time I ever thought I might be too cautious.

&#x200B;

So fuck men who think women are too paranoid for being cautious. Also fuck anyone who apologizes to men for women being cautious.",476,"[""Welcome to Reddit's most active feminist community!

I was homeschooled and didn’t really have many opportunities to do things outside of the house without my family, so I was never really in situations where I had to watch out for myself. \n\nThen last year I went to Europe as an exchange student, and I was basically all by myself. I’d go to big cities to spend a day with my friends and then take the public transport back home. I’d still be cautious about making sure I had my phone on me and ready in case I needed to call for help and I’d always try to be with a group when possible, but for the most part I wasn’t too paranoid. I guess I figured I wasn’t the type of girl who would catch men’s attention — I don’t know why, probably a combination of my not being so feminine, and also my general lack of attraction to or interest in men; they’re just irrelevant to me, so I guess I felt like I’d be irrelevant to them. \n\nSo one night I was coming home from one of those days with my friends and the train was pretty crowded. I got a seat next to the window and then a man about 10 years older than me (and I was underage) asked if he could sit next to me as nowhere else was free. I said sure, then went back to reading my book. He leans over to me and sort of nudges me and asks me if the train is going x place, I say I’m not sure, but I can pull up an app and check for you. So I did that and then went back to reading my book. He leans over again and asks, very politely, if it would be okay if we had a conversation. I figured, you know what, I’m on exchange, the point of the whole thing is to meet new people, and besides, the train ride is going to be an hour long, so I guess it’s nice to briefly introduce yourself to the person you’re sitting next to. We talked for maybe 10 minutes before I ran out of things to say, and so I went back to reading my book. He started to get mad at me for it and said, “put the book away, you said we would talk.” Then he tried to get my phone number, then my Instagram. I gave him my Instagram to get him to stop asking me with the intention that I would block him when I got home. I basically tried to ignore him the rest of the train ride, leaning as close to the window as I could and keeping my book open. He leaned almost against me the full hour, and when I got up to get off and transfer to my next train, he followed me. Luckily he realized that my next train wouldn’t get him where he needed to go. He told me to accept his follow request when I got home and then went to his platform. \n\n10 minutes later, on my next train, there was a man acting a little panicked cause he’d gotten on the wrong train and wasn’t sure where he was now going. Figuring it would be pretty unlikely for 2 guys in a row to be creeps, I answered him when he asked me where the train was going. He immediately stopped freaking out and sat down across from me and started trying to chat me up, complimenting me on my language skills cause I clearly had an accent. I said sorry, I think you’re a bit old for me. “What! How old do you think I am?” \n\n“30?”\n\n“Noooo! I’m 27! That’s not too old for you! What’s your number?”\n\nI told him that I didn’t have a phone number or an Instagram cause I liked books (lol), and I showed him my (still open) book as proof and said he needed to get off here or else he’d miss his stop, and he left. In the 5 minutes I talked with him he was very pushy and made me feel really uncomfortable.\n\nBut man. All it took was one commute back home for me to stop giving men I don’t know the benefit of the doubt. I could very easily have been followed home _twice_. \n\n(Sorry this got so long.

No, I remember even libfems originally wanted trans people to be able to use their preferred facilities, not get fired or denied a home for being trans, and have helpful resources available to them. Most trans women tried to pass and looked for women\'s spaces that welcomed them instead of targeting the ones that didn\'t. People, myself included, assumed all trans people had the goal of getting ""the big surgery"" when they could.\n\nWomen didn\'t plan on letting men, especially men that look and act like men to take over all our spaces. We didn\'t want middle aged sports men competing with and often winning against young women in their prime. We didn\'t want child birth to be about ""pregnant people"" instead of mothers. We didn\'t want to be called uterus-havers, menstrators, bleeders, and non-prostate owners.\n\nMen that fetishize womanhood purposely tossed transexuals out and redefined what a trans woman is. Most of us saw trans women as ""biological women\'s"" biggest allies at the time. We wanted to be open minded and accepted ideas like brain sex since it made trans women comfortable. Some women just keep accepting these ideas while some of us bailed at some point like when the cotton ceiling arguments became too much to ignore.', 'Wow, I was told this subreddit was full of man hating radfems who will crucify you for questioning progressive “orthodoxy”.

bj918s,bj918s,I’m part of a sml group of physicians that was harassed online & I am baffled,"Hi, I’ve read a thread or two here but never posted or commented that I Can remember, since the subject matter wasn’t entirely (as I thought) relevant to my life, but something happened this past month that I still have no words to explain & I’d like to...share with people who’d understand, & maybe even know how to counsel me. I have only very few female colleagues I can speak about this & even then, it seems we all are walking on eggshells around this subject when talking to each other, & that is very frustrating.

Well, what happened: 

Most of my patients are infants, children, teens & very young adults suffering from cancers & other neurological issues. Seldom I get a trans patient & when I do it is almost always due to metastasis from breast/ovarian/uterine/cervical cancer, or endocrine tumors arising from interactions we not yet understand completely of genes with the hormonal overdoses & pituitary/adrenal suppression suffered in childhood due to blockers - which is an issue in itself as, unfortunately, these numbers are steadly rising, including of tumors we did not ever see in people younger than 40-60, all in the last five years - but not even close to the number of non-trans people we get. Especially young girls who were victims of some sort of abuse, be it by a family member or partner. 

Young adult women & older teen girls with untractable epilepsy & all sorts of neurological trauma resulting from their partner’s or father’s abuse. It has always happened & the number has always been slowly increasing but this year has been absolutely insane.  Since Dec 2018 our floor has had 20 teenagers with serious injuries ranging from intracranial bleeds due to having their head bashed against walls or the floor to burst aneurysms. A few of the nurses organized with few of us residents/fellows, social workers, one good friend from Psych & another old friend from Gyne. We created a small public website with a forum to gather data on this specific population, & to talk about solutions & suggestions to improve preventive measures we could take during & after inpatient stays, how to inform & educate practitioners & the community to see & understand the signs, but the biggest focus was for the health care community, how to better act/treat patients who had been victims & how to prevent our numbers from increasing even more since what we realistically CAN do, which is simply reporting to the authorities & giving them a few leaflets with DV info & DV hotlines/shelters is laughably inedaquate & we sadly seen a big increase in patients return not only to the ER after the 1st abuse incidence, but straight to the morgue.

We did not expect much attention at all or advertise our online presence anywhere as we didn’t want our project to be scrutinized by Legal or HR (which always makes it more complicated by categorizing any grouping of over 3ppl as some sort of campus org - teaching hospitals can be a PITA); but, somehow, after about a week, the woman who was running the website called me in tears. She said we had been DDOSd. We couldn’t understand or even imagine who’d ever want to hurt a group of women trying to organize a response to do something about domestic/partner violence against young teen/adult girls in our community. Most nurses were SURE that it was the work of 4chan, MRAs, the red pill. 

No. It was trans activists. We have zero idea where from. The why is - according to the all-caps, misogynistic-insults filled screeds sent to our email - that we were being “exclusionary”, that our project was “irresponsible” because we were neglecting to mention that the most oppressed & most at risk group of people wasn’t women & girls, but trans women, & that us excluding them meant we didn’t consider them women, & that made us transphobic, bigoted....& somehow fascist, Trump supporters.  For a while we thought it must be the work of trolls or people who hate Transgender people wanting them to look bad, but it wouldn’t stop. It didn’t stop until we deleted everything, including the email address & proceed with our little project inside our own hospital forum. 

But the whole experience was baffling & eye opening. Some of us got contacted on our personal emails, one with a picture of her front door, the subject of the email being “full name of her daughter + goes to x school”. I got one text with a colored baseball bat (??) with fake blood all over it. Idk wtf that was supposed to mean, but it was intimidating. 

My psych colleague is absolutely sure it is a staff member. I didn’t want to believe it, but I see no other option. The thought that someone who personally knows us & either works with us or studies with us/teaches us is bone chilling. I wish it was only a few nuts on the internet, but irl people...& who & for what reason? Someone inside our floor didn’t like what we were doing & spread it to the wrong group to stop us. Well, maybe now they think they have succeeded?

* 

I guess I’m writing here because I don’t know of any other place to write that wouldn’t ban me or be vicious against me or worse; try to doxx me & threaten my career which is the most important thing in my life.

I have NEVER had a single issue with transgender people before this. Well, one, but it was more of a personal issue of someone who happened to be trans, but not them as a group, & I have always defended them. Other than my professional concerns about treatment for teems in transition, I never really thought about T people in one way or another.

But reading a few pages here & after this happened, I don’t know what to think anymore. It’s like a punch in the gut. The only other bad experience with trans people I had was a guy who I had been friends with for over a decade, who I didn’t really see much due to us going to separate schools . & choosing different careers, (I also thought he was a bit creepy as he had pursued me a bit obsessively when I was engaged to another man).

After he came out as a woman (but dressed as a guy at work/family events & insisted on being referred to as “he” professionally & most times) he started openly harassing mutual friends of ours, and shamelessly not only hitting on their husbands/bfs (just to piss ppl off since he was the one of the most hetero guys I’ve ever been around...y’know the type, macho man, muscly, huge beard, homophobic, very into traditional gender roles, dreamed about marrying a virgin & having tons of children, insisted women were “naturally submissive” & other crap that made me block him on FB years ago), but younger girls barely out of HS & one of our good friend’s 14yr old daughter. He would tell them he was better than any dude because he was also a woman, and no one else would understand them & support them like he could. It was vile. 

But since he had ALWAYS been...well, creepy, & we had all been aware to take a bunch of precautions around him waaaaay before he even thought of coming out as trans, we all just thought he would’ve been a garbage person & a sexist, pedophilic creep regardless of his trans status & both things were unrelated. Every woman has a story like that about a creep to tell, so why was his transness even important? 

But reading more & more about the common characteristics of some men that transition later in life or in their late 20s like my former friend, & after a long conversation with my good friend about paraphilias (she’s the psychiatrist who was heading our small project) I have begun to have my doubts. 

My worry is that this is effecting young kids a lot; I see it in my practice. I thought it was just physically but now I see that it is much more than that. 
I am still very afraid I am being unfair, suffering from some sort of confirmation bias & contributing to the further marginalization of vulnerable people.....then again...I am in literal FEAR for my career for even writing these things down & there’s almost no venue to talk about even medical/treatment concerns that are absolutely normal to any other patient group & condition - & that went from rubbing me the wrong way to terrifying me.

How can anyone possibly try to do anything against this without murdering their career? I am about to become Chief Resident (pgy7) & if it came out I was a bigot of any kind...I can’t even think about it. But at the same time, I am worried & not saying anything or at least investigating & collecting data to better understand it & educate my peers is just agains all I believe in & my code of conduct. And some colleagues of mine (namely in Endocrinology and Psych) no longer feel they can prescribe the now-standard issued med protocol to transgender patients without violating our oath & our conscience. My colleague is worried sick for some of her patients, saying that she can’t deny transition to them anymore (too dangerous to get sued, our malpractise insurance is insanely high as it is & the negative media to our hospital would be...unwelcome. She is also only what, 4yrs out of residency. It’d kill her chances of private practice) , can’t refer to psychD (because of the whole “affirming” principle), can’t even tell the parents about her concerns over detransition & hormonal overdose & pituitary tumors. It’s freaking scary, frustrating & discouraging. 

What do? How do you live with this knowledge when the cognitive dissonance no longer holds any space in your brain? How do you counsel parents, patients? What to do about all of this? Is the situation this horrible when it comes to the red tape & censorship to publish & collect data??

I am just...literally stunned.

There\'s an endless supply of them. As an older lesbian (I\'m retired now), I\'ve held good jobs in places in the U.S. that were very hostile to lesbians and gays.

Fortunately, the world has changed a great deal for lesbians and gays because of the many people willing to fight back against the homophobes. The squeaky wheel gets the grease and all. Likewise, you and I have both benefited from the work of the many feminists who have fought for educational and job opportunities for women. The suffragettes, Gloria Steinem and all the other feminists since her weren\'t greeted with open arms by men. They had to fight. We\'re still fighting.

There is no possibility for a \'mismatch\' and the idea that there is is based in some deep social assumptions, mostly sexism and brain/body disconnect.\n\nYou\'re a doctor, please review the literature on this. There have been twin studies done showing that being transgender is not a congenital trait. It is learned after childhood and outside the home. There have been studies showing that most children who identify as trans go on to be perfectly normal adults *unless* they are given affirmative treatment and \'transition\' of any kind (in which case almost all of them go on to develop worse dysphoria and \'need\' full genital surgery).

She is the daughter of a friend who has had a long battle with anorexia and been hospitalized several times. Recently, just after one of her mothers hospitalizations, she came out as a lesbian and was accepted. Then she came out as gender non-conforming, gender fluid, non-binary, and finally as a transboy. And with that last one finally she met some opposition from her mother who explained that it is not possible for her to be a boy. She can behave, do or love who and what she likes, but she is and always will be a female. Her school has let her \'socially transition\' and calls her by her \'boy name\'. She no longer uses the girls toilets as she has told all the other children she is a boy but she also isn\'t comfortable using the boys toilets for obvious reasons. She got her period recently so this is causing huge issues for her. She has been binding her breasts. Now she wants to go on medications to stop her period and start her ""transitioning to a boy"". She has also started self harming. Her mother wanted to get her a referral for good psychiatric help and has been trying for a while, she was given a referral to [this place.](https://www.rch.org.au/adolescent-medicine/gender-service/) This is the best hospital in our area.

crloug,crloug,Why I stopped believing in cis privilege,"I remember the way privilege was first explained to me when I first started getting into feminism and anti-racism at uni a few years ago: having privilege doesn't mean your life is perfect, it just means you have one less thing in your life to worry about. Of course, the concept of privilege is far more nuanced than that, but it's was a simple way of explaining it in the context of our everyday lives.

Class privilege means you're not struggling to make ends meet, white privilege means you won't randomly get screamed at to go back to where you came from, male privilege means you aren't terrified of walking down a dark street alone at night.

Cis privilege? That was just stuff like having a body that matched your gender identity, not having to correct people on your pronouns, etc. Honestly, pretty small stuff that didn't seem like a big deal and fit with that basic understanding of privilege.

At this time, most of the trans people I knew were female, socialised as female and generally sweet people who identified as ""queer"" anti-capitalists, so I just shrugged and accepted that cis privilege was a thing and moved on.

Then TRAs started pushing for more. TIMs started demanding more and more and more.

Cis privilege is having periods.

Cis privilege is getting pregnant.

Cis privilege is having a female body.

Cis privilege is you having something I want.

I was seeing all these accusations of cis privilege that were targeted almost exclusively at feminist women, and was no longer able to reconcile them with my understanding of what privilege was and how it operates in my life.

Sure, I can accept that I hold some form of racial privilege over a friend of mine because I can walk into shops and not immediately get profiled and followed around.

But I'm privileged because I get periods? I've stained my sheets, my clothes, had my period start halfway through class and not realise it until I'd bled through my pants. I've been in so much pain I've seen dark spots dance in front of my eyes before passing out on the bathroom floor. Periods aren't one less thing in my life to worry about, they're one more thing to worry about.

And that's not even taking into account all the women and girls who can't afford or access sanitary products, whose periods severely impact their ability to go to school or work. And how about women who live in places where getting their period could potentially threaten their health, or even their life?

A line was crossed when TRAs started characterising female suffering as a sort of ""privilege.""

You wouldn't call an infertile woman ""privileged"" for not having to risk pregnancy, even if you never want to get pregnant yourself.

Among these reasons are things like ""I can walk into a retail clothing store and not be followed around while I shop"" and ""the crayon labeled \'flesh\' matches my skin color.""

(In her defense, she didn\'t imply that it was scientific.) She also omitted--perhaps because she didn\'t see why it mattered--that she enjoyed a great number of privileges herself due to being affluent her whole life, which is why the most common objection to the *assumption* that white privilege is an established fact is the McIntosh did not rule out class as being an important factor, if not *the* most important factor, in who has ""privilege"" or not.\n\nThere are other issues with the idea, such as how such a phenomenon might be clearly defined so we can objectively determine who has ""privilege"" and who does not, and along those lines, how it might be measured, tracked, or--and this is the real catch--disproved / falsified / proven to end.

c9elrl,c9elrl,"""You reduce womanhood to biology!""","This is one of the most rubbish TRA arguments I see and it's been bugging me because of how lame it is, yet it's being used to smear us by angry men.

The definition of woman: Adult human female. Definition of female: **Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes.**

We don't **reduce** womanhood to biology. What we say is that biology is the *defining factor*, the only consistent one. There are many social and cultural things tagged onto womanhood, however, the only way to identify a woman *is* her biology, as evidenced by a GNC woman still being identifiable as a woman. We know about the baggage associated with womanhood, but that baggage was imposed on us based on our reproductive biology.

If you want to change the definition of ""woman"" to ""a feeling a man has about himself based on cultural stereotypes of female people"" then woman literally - and I mean literally - means absolutely nothing. Of course, we would then be without language to describe biological sex (menstruators? Ejaculators?) and thus sex-based rights and protections dissolve - the longer I see the TRAs floundering about online the more I realise their movement is one big word game, but I digress.

TRAs and Gender Theists seem to be unable to grasp this particular concept: biological sex is NOT a personality, and neither is a ""gender identity"". When we say someone is a woman because they produce female gametes, have a uterus and ovaries, have XX sex chromosomes etc., we are saying that and nothing more. She is a woman due to biology. HOW is that reducing anybody to anything? **She as a PERSON isn't defined by biology but her womanhood is.** Her sex is incidental. It's like saying you're reducing a book to its pages or reducing water to its H2O molecules. 

I also think it's very sneaky how they seem to consider female biology reductive given their use of language (our bodies are the genetic default and can create life but never mind all that icky stuff). We never hear ""you're reducing manhood to biology!"" They say ""reducing women to vaginas"", but not ""reducing men to penises"". I WoNdEr WhY.

Edit: I want to add a quick footnote regarding infertile women, since the TRAs keep crying about this (as if they give a shit about infertile women and aren't just trying to protect men's feelings). Infertile women are FEMALE. They have female anatomy and a female karyotype. There are many reasons a woman may be infertile; a birth defect, injury, illness, or an operation. That does not change the fact they belong to the sex that **can** produce female gametes (and they have no genes for maleness, that's the SRY gene and others on the **Y chromosome**, look it up!). Are you really going to compare literal XY sperm-producing MALES to infertile females?! Sorry, are transwomen now just regular females who cannot reproduce?? You're actually comparing infertile and intersex women to MEN who decide they'd like to LARP as women. What a gross insult.
