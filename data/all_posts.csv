cvbg17,am I just looking at this wrong?,"I've had something brewing in my head for a while now relating to the LGBTQ community and I thought this was the best place to have a discussion about it.  

and just to put it out there for the sake of the discussion; I'm a cis bisexual girl attracted to men and women both trans and cis.  

I've seen a lot of posts similar to [this](https://i.redd.it/npj8936t97i31.png) where a person claims everyone who isn't sexually attracted to trans people is tranphobic. I think most people agree that you don't need to be sexually attracted to someone to accept and respect them as a person but that's not really what I wanted to talk about today. what I came here to discuss is that I can't help but feel this is a transphobic mindset, where trans acceptance can only be fully achieved when everyone views transgender people as sexual beings. it doesn't matter if you're accepting and supportive of trans people, the fact you don't want to have sex with them automatically makes you a bigot. this mindset seems to put a person's sexual attraction -- or lack there of -- to someone above that person's view of someone as a human being, where it doesn't matter that you treat trans people the same way you treat cis people, all that matters is if you are sexually attracted to them, that's what determines if you're actually supportive of them.  

it just seems like it's putting trans people in a purely sexual light where other people's sexual attraction is crucial in them achieving equality, at least that's what it seems like to me.

but as the title says, am I just looking at this wrong? I don't expect this to be some game-changing discussion with opinions from all over the political spectrum being expressed, I just want to hear what the people of this sub have to say, I particularly want to hear transgender people's opinions on this and if they feel it's harmful or not. I in general have a problem with articulating myself and properly expressing my opinions in a way others can understand or I just forget to mention certain things I wanted to, but I've been sitting on this for way too long so I'll just post it and edit it to clarify what I mean or add things I forgot, I do hope I was able to get my point across in an at least somewhat coherent way.

cv54rf,"Buckle up, it's gonna take a while to explain...","Hello world,

So ... I'm male, 35, gay and I only made peace with myself at the age of 32. I am from a country where, back in the '90s, ""pederasty"" was a crime (not enough to earn a death sentence, but enough to pretty much ruin your life forever) so I did the same everyone ever did -- I learned to mix with the crowd and go incognito. My first real-life sexual intercourse was around the age of 18, set up via text-based chatroom, with an older man - 40, I think. Until then, all I knew about gay sex were from videos covertly downloaded overnight via dial-based internet.

It was *horrible*, traumatizing even. He tried to force me to bottom and I had absolutely *zero experience* with that, so my first contact set it in stone that I don't like to do anal as I immediately associate it with pain and discomfort.

Since then and until I accepted myself completely, I've experienced that feeling of guilt many people (but especially closet gay men) describe immediately after the climax. A sense of deep regret and denial, which in men always manifests as comments to the tune of ""this isn't the real me. I'm not like this.""

As farfetched as it's going to sound, up to 2010 I had a cyclical (self-destructive?) pattern of hoarding porn videos, fantasizing about them, trying to set up a real-life hook-up (this was before I discovered Grindr, so yeah - it wasn't immediate) and inevitably regretting the experience and the steps I took to make it possible. I once deleted about 80GB of gay porn, telling myself that I was turning a new leaf... only to rebuild the collection some time later. I know the name of porn stars I like: I'm like a *porn connoisseur* because I know things like the name of producers, movie titles and even the real name of some porn stars. I even know which ones have been ***lost to suicide.*** (You have no idea how many times other men were talking shit about one porn actor or another, creating their own little fantasy worlds to jerk off, and I'd tell them that those actors committed suicide. It made for ... *interesting conversation.*)

Only after watching a documentary called ""The Butch Factor"" did I begin the steps to accept myself. Because, just as in the video, I wasn't sure I was gay because I don't like the things that gays are stereotypically said to enjoy (I'm a rocker, for one; I don't really like or follow Madonna, Lady Gaga or Rihanna, for example) so I didn't really felt that I should ""come out"" because up to that point, there was no purpose taking up a banner that would make me a target for bullying and prejudice (the society I live in is extremely hypocrite).

However, I learned something ... and in the hardest way ever: the gay scene where I live is ALMOST COMPLETELY mixed with drugs. Marijuana, Cocaine, Crystal Meth, Crack, Ecstasy... you name it. And because of ""peer"" pressure, I experimented cocaine-fueled sex parties. **Here is where the problem begins**.

It's been two, almost three years now where I feel pressured to use drugs like Cocaine, because it's otherwise impossible to hook up with a man. One guy said a phrase that really scared me: ""gay sex just isn't the same without drugs"". And some of these guys pointed to me in gay porn videos where actors are systematically addicted to things like cocaine and poppers.

I feel extremely lonely and longing for companionship: together with a psychotherapist, I realized that I'm frequently trying to have sex because I feel isolated and ostracized since I accepted myself (*I* accepted myself; my ""friends"" were not so open-minded). And because gay sex ""requires"" (please take this with a salt pincher) drugs, well..... you can imagine I have more than a few things to fix with myself, right? And until I discovered this subreddit yesterday, I didn't *even know sex addiction was a thing*. **But now it makes perfect sense**.

This is my story. And I hope I can begin a new chapter as soon as I press ""POST"". But please... *help me*?",,SexAddiction,https://reddit.com/r/SexAddiction/comments/cv54rf/buckle_up_its_gonna_take_a_while_to_explain/

cue9tx,Mentally ill dysphoric ftm thinking of detransitioning,"So I have a lot of mental health issues other than being trans, mostly very low self worth and horrible social anxiety.. the anxiety has been so bad I’ve even considered dropping out of college tbh. 

Transitioning was probably the worst mistake of my life, other than an abusive relationship. I lost my entire family who kicked me out when I was in high school. We’re on a little better terms but they act like strangers and my mom doesn’t say a word if I’m there. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like all my memories with them are fake. 

I was so much more liked and valued as a girl. People cared about my emotions. I’m not into guys so I’d be upset a lot when I tried to befriend guys and they’d hit on me, or only pretend to care about me to try to fuck me. I think that might’ve been a major reason I transitioned in the first place. 

I miss friendships w girls. I never felt like one of them but i feel like any girl could walk into a room and start taking to any girl, since they have something in common. Girls hate me now. Old friends are “friendly” but have distanced themselves from me so we *never* see each other irl. Any girls I’ve tried to befriend give me short uninterested replies, and I wanna be like “I just wanna talk, I’m not even attracted/hitting on you!” 

I’m going into college this year and am thinking about stopping HRT so I can actually be able to make friends. I’ve been living as a guy for 2 years and have been nothing but lonely and miserable. The world is only made for guys if you’re social, successful and attractive. 

Yeah my body dysphoria will probably be awful if I stop T but I’m thinking it’s better than being miserable forever. I wish I could just be a lesbian and be happy with myself.

cqqlcv,Dealing with internalised fatphobia as a queer trans-masc person,"Wasn’t quite sure how to flare this but Tw for discussion of internalised fatphobia


Blah just having sad and insecure feelings about being fat/chubby and the intense aesthetics that can exist in the gay/queer community. From what I can tell, it’s hard enough being cis and gay when you’re fat 🤦🏻‍♂️

I have no particular preference for skinny people myself, I’m into people with all sorts of bodies (most of the people I’ve been really attracted to haven’t been thin? But a couple have?). I wasn’t wildly happier when I was thin either, as I was in my teens and early 20s. But it was one less thing to feel stressed  about 

And I’m lucky that generally, at the size I’m at now, people I’ve been into have been into me. And I also think western beauty ideals are fucked up and I hate that they’ve got under my skin. 

But I got a lot more attention from people when I was thin 😒. It shows the subtle fatphobia and how people can just write you off. When society says you’re not gonna be attracted to someone, sometimes you have to actually stop and ask yourself “am I into this person?” and I think a lot of people don’t do that

 But then this little voice in my head says “you’re stomach is too big you’re gonna end up alllooonnneeee” like some mf fatphobic ghost in my head.

cvhx6p,Could I Be Intersex?,"I almost feel silly posting this here, since I truly have no idea if I'm actually intersex yet. But I'm currently in the very beginning stages of medically transitioning from male to female gender wise. When I went to my doctor, who specializes in transgender health care, she pointed out that I was already very feminine (which I already knew). She told me that she expects me to feminize very quickly, and also in a conventionally effective way. Basically, she expects me to ""pass"" rapidly and easily. Ever since childhood, I've been told I would make a pretty girl, and that I was very feminine. So this is definitely a pretty commonly made observation.

After a few visits, we realized I may be more physically feminine than most others who are not intersex. The main things that stuck out to us were that I had narrower than average shoulders for my age (almost 21 years old), wide set hips for my frame, a pretty rounded hairline, a completely female passing voice (I answer phones at work, and am called ma'am a lot without trying), possibly more breast tissue than average(?), I'm 5'10"", and I have less body hair than many cis women, and virtually no facial hair.

My immediate thought has always been Klinefelter Syndrome. But I seem to have average sized testicles (as far as I can tell), and a larger than average penis. I've also never had erectile issues, nor any other sexual inabilities. Also, we checked my testosterone levels, and to both of our surprise, I was within standard ranges (Testosterone Serum: 621 ng/dL, Free Testosterone: 10.5 pg/dL). Ultimately, we decided to do karyotyping, so I should know soon regardless, but I've just begun part of my hormone replacement therapy treatment, and I'm sort of trying to gauge what kind of expectations I should have with my transition. It seems like girls with Klinefelter Syndrome often have a different overall result when transitioning. I guess my actual question is, does it sound like I'm intersex at all? Even not Klinefelter, but something else? Or does anything stand out as definitively not intersex?

Thanks in advance for any input!

cv9tnp,TranscribeMe...wtf do they really want?,"so I know a lot of people have been saying bad things about TM, but I needed something because nobody would hire me in real life- because I don't have any experience and can't get any experience because nobody would hire me, so I thought to myself, why not lemme just try TM!

So the exam results were like this: 100% for both multiple choice and true or false questions. For the audios I got 94% , 95% and 96% (point something of course) and they still failed me. I think more than 90% is a good grade huh?

Now my question is do they really EXPECT you to get 100% or more than 96% to pass (meaning 97 or 98 or 99 are the passing grades?) or they just failed me because I'm from a non english speaking country? please tell me how this thing works!

It took so much courage to get to this point. I have been taking such good care of myself. Loving who I am and how I am looking. So happy with my life. I came to Oregon 2 weeks ago as a fresh start for myself. Somewhere where I could transition and really embrace this new life ... away from the pressures and expectations of anyone who has ever known me. 

I was blindsided/sucker-punched and then dragged across the ground by my hair. As I’m screaming in the fetal position, this guy continues to punch me in the head.  Thankfully someone heard my screams, ran over and got the guy off of me. Probably saved my life.  

Coming out as trans basically demolished my old life and everything that I knew to be real.  I’ve been rebuilding for a year.  I’ve been building an authentic and beautiful foundation for my life. 

It makes me so sad that humans can treat each other like this.  I didn’t say one word to this guy. I didn’t raise my hands or touch him. I never had a chance to defend myself. 

I’m really scared about my recovery and how all of this is going to effect my transition.  And any permanent changes I might see in my facial structure.   

My poor dog was in the car and saw everything. She got taken to the shelter and I never got a chance to say bye to her.  She is my best friend and has stuck by my side throughout all of this.

Ive heard stories about violence against transgender individuals but never expected something to happen to me.  I’ve been so liberated lately... presenting female even when I am pre HRT. 

I don’t want to live my life scared of how people will react to me. I just want to be happy and peaceful. Why is it such a challenge to live life as myself. 

This problem is not specific to me, and not even specific to the trans community.  We are a global community. We are all in this together.  What is different is not scary.  

I refuse to dim my light. I refuse to hate my attacker. I refuse to be anything other than myself.  Let us celebrate our differences.  The person who attacked me is searching for love and acceptance.  And so am I.  

This is hard. Please pray for me, my surgeons my recovery.

So for a little background I was looking at some Red Bubble stickers when I came across a sticker of my favorite character (who is a tomboy) with a trans pride flag behind her. I thought this was pretty funny because there is a joke in my fandom about her being a boy. so I posted the picture on my story with the caption hahah or something. I thought i should have posted it on my close friends story but i got the support from my friend and decided to post it on my main story. I knew it was risky so i posted a disclaimer i had nothing against trans people, but the story still got replies.  One of which is from someone i have never talked to before and had plans to stay in a hotel with them in a few months. So bad first impression. We went back and forth, them calling me transphobic and me trying to defend myself as i thought it was funny.  I know now that i shouldnt have posted it on my story but should i feel bad about it when i really meant no harm and said sorry a few times?

cv3luh,WIBTA moving out meaning my family would likely be evicted?,"I (26F) live with my mother (52F) and sister (13F). I pay most of the bills and rent since I have a decently paying job and my mother is unemployed.

Last year I started dating my girlfriend (32F). My mother is a very strict christian and doesn't approve at all (side note, my girlfriend is trans and you'd think that would cancel out because in her eyes she's a man therefore I'm in a heterosexual relationship... but logic doesn't seem to apply in christianity since I guess that just makes us double gay in her eyes) but since I pay the bills she can't really strong arm me into breaking up with her. 

Recently my girlfriend needed a place to stay because her apartment building was being renovated so I told my mother that I wanted her to stay with us. Predictably she completely freaked out at the idea saying that she would not be having sin under her roof. I reminded her that I'm paying most of the rent and living expenses but she refused to budge saying that it would be a bad influence for my sister (who is very comfortably straight anyway).

The conversation ended there but I wasn't just going to leave my girlfriend hanging. My mother being as controlling as she is had the lease be in her name even though I'm the one actually paying for it. So I talked with my girlfriend about the situation and we decided to just find a new place together. We also agreed that my sister could live with us for free if our mother lets us.

I brought up the new plan to my mother. She did not take it well at all. Asked me what she was supposed to do. I told her that my sister is welcome to stay with us but she would have to figure something out for herself, or she could decide to stop choosing to be homophobic (she loves saying we choose to be gay) and let my girlfriend move in. She's since shut herself up in her room and isn't talking to me or my sister. I told my sister what was going on and hugged her and promised she'd always be welcome to stay with me if I end up moving out.

The current plan is: If my mother doesn't budge I suspect she will end up homeless and I will then be able to call cps to make sure my sister ends up with me. I feel really guilty that it has to go this way but I've spent my entire life putting up with her homophobia and I'm sick of it.",,AmItheAsshole,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cv3luh/wibta_moving_out_meaning_my_family_would_likely/

For the past month or so I have been feeling intensely depressed and having strong urges to self harm that I have thankfully been able to resist.

I have one friend and I told her about how I've been feeling but she told me that she isn't able to be there for me because of her own issues she's dealing with and I have no other friends to talk to.

My hobbies include playing soccer, sleeping in when I have time, and hanging out with people IRL. I enjoy school a lot, my favorite subjects are math and science. Just got a keyboard(piano) so I can hopefully learn to play it soon. I listen to pretty much every genre of music, it just depends on my mood, a few of my favorites are: Blueberry Faygo- Lil Mosey, New Light-John Mayer, Candy Paint/Go Flex- Post Malone, Flare Guns- Quinn XCII, and Ocean Eyes- Billie Eilish.
I also love all types of movies especially the MCU, although I have yet to see Endgame. Right now I feel like watching a chick flick like a walk to remember or the notebook. If you have any movie recommendations send them my way. 
I’m a pretty laidback but talkative and outgoing person.

cvhndf,Should I drop my transphobic friend?,"cw//transphobia

This girl and I have known each other for four years, on and off again as friends. We get along, but we aren't compatible. We only hang out because we have similar interests. There are many reasons why I dislike her, but the biggest one has got to be that she calls herself a radical feminist, doesn't respect my pronouns unless making a joke like ""god got confused and gave me the excess testosterone and not you', and only respects her ex's pronouns when they're getting along.

I only came out two months ago, and I can't be out to my parents for safety (I'm 18 but I have nowhere to go), so her having trouble calling me Michael he/him was really understandable at first. Until I started coming out to more of my friends and they have all taught themselves by using my name and pronouns excessively for a little bit (my deadname is androgynous so  around my parents they still can call me my deadname and it not bother me as much). She still hasn't even attempted unless we go to a craft store or something and she goes ""oh hey it's a Michael in a Michael's!"" which was lowkey funny but really pissed me off. When I got my hair cut (from down to my ribs to a super short haircut) she said ""yessssss bitch we stan secret gay"". This infuriated me for a really weird reason. I'm not trying to be gay, I'm just trying to pass a little bit more. At the beginning of my realization, I did not want hormones. I was scared and just didn't want them, and one day she asked me ""are you really a guy? or are you just more of a tomboy who doesn't think that she can be manly without being trans because libfems?""

ME: ""Yeah. I'm a guy. I know it.""  

Her: ""Okay, I just am worried that you'll realize that you're actually a girl and detransitioning is so bad for you.""

ME: ""Oh no I'm not going on hormones, that's just a lot for me.""

Well, flash forward to today, we were in walmart and talking about how my leg was in pain after my first ever Epinephrine shot last night at the ER (I'm anaphylactic to kiwifruit apparently). I said ""Yeah, it's a muscle shot so it hurts more. I'm gonna be fuuuuuuuucked when I go on T."" 

She stopped in her tracks and was like ""You're going on T?"" She had already voiced her concerns about my plan for top surgery (telling me that it will royally mess up my body, that I could die because it's a surgery, I should just stick to binding with sports bras which doesn't work because triple D's, etc.)

I was like ""yeah, I decided to, I just really hate how I am and since it gets worse on my period, I think it's because of the wrong hormones going through my body.""

HER:""Okay okay honey, you know I love you, but hormones are a bad idea.""

ME: ""I've researched it and I know it's best for me and I will be going the safest route. In the future of course because I'm broke.""

HER:""I trust you, but can I voice my concerns?""

I threw my hands up in pissed off surrender and I'm like ""go ahead""

HER: ""It's bad for you, it will mess up your body, being trans is still very new to you, cervical and breast cancer risks are higher with it and that already runs in your family-""

ME: ""No it doesn't. No cancer runs in my family, luckily.""

HER:""Oh okay, well it could still happen, and when you decide this isn't what you want, detransitioning is hard.""

ME: ""I understand, but i know this is what i want. I'm just broke right now.""

We left the conversation at that. She is just getting on my nerves daily about how ""transgirls are just pedophiles and transguys just want to escape the patriarchy"". What should I do about this? I have started not wanting her in my life, but she's the only person I see often in real life outside the guy I'm seeing (a transguy that she has no problem gendering correctly because he passes better and she always knew him as a guy), She is just getting unbearable, and it's not only her transphobia that's the problem, but I'm sticking to the topic at hand. If you wanna know other stuff comment or PM me.

cv6gfi,My coming out horror story.,"So, some background. My parents are hyperconservatives. I was afraid to tell them and expected to be disowned so i moved to the Netherlands to study and transition. I've been transitioning for 10months now, and mostly blend in/pass.

But, i had to come back because of an allergy medication i had to take. So i came out a week before I flew back to bulgaria(home country), via a letter. I was expecting to get immediately disowned so i saved up money and so on, i was prepared. But what i was met with was positivity and support. At least until i came back. I should have been sketched out but i mean i really didn't want parents to be dicks so i somehow accepted that. 

Well, i got a return flight to bulgaria, and flew there. My dad asked me how much money i had left. I said 5 euro, which was truth. 

Well we meet, we talk small talk and we come back home. I take my things to my room. They wanna talk. Sure. 

So, apparently, my dad called my aunt who is a cardiologist. She told them that giving estradiol to men is illegal, this is incredibly toxic and i will die at 25 unless i stop. She pointed them to a drug addiction therapist, and said i must be a drug addict to want to take hormones. My dad and mom were seriously freaked out, obviously, and called the therapist, who said they can't help me and pointed them to gender therapists who had a long waiting list. 

But my parents wanna fix me NOW. So they called a sexologist who advertised helping sexually confused aka trans people. Red flag. They said we're going to 3 specialists (except not the gender therapists) and they will tell me if im trans or not. My parents believed that the gays have brainwashed me into thinking I'm trans. So i agreed. 

My mom spent the whole day crying and called me a clown. My sister spent the whole day pointing out things about me that will make parents more angry, like that i pierced my ears, and laughed. She said that it was my choice and i can stop hormones at any time. Called me a heshe. Then told me to not talk to her again. 

So a few hours go by and my aunt calls me. Up to now i really loved her. We had so many close memories together and i didn't expect what she said. She spent 30 mins telling me how I'm a freak, a clown, a mutilated piece of garbage. She said I'm self harming, will never be a real woman, everyone is disgusted by me and so on. It was a whole thing. Lasted 45mins. I was crying by the end of it. 

I couldn't eat or sleep that day. 

Also i realised quite quickly that they changed all the locks and all rooms were locked. I wasn't allowed to go outside or my dad would cancel my plane ticket back. 

Next day rolls, were going to a therapist. My dad said yesterday that we were going to an endocrinologist. I say wait, didn't you say endocrinologist, and they tell me that I'm brain damaged by the hormones and I can't understand simple words, thwy never said anything abput an endocrinologist . 

We go there. Therapist asks me why I'm here. I say i didn't know I'd be here until yesterday. He asks my dad, he says his thing, and then the therapist asks me why i think I'm trans. I start with the beginning, from since i was a kid. He interrupts me and says my voice is annoying and I sound horrible, and that every trans person has a dumbass since they were a kid story,and it reeks of implanted memories. 

He then continued to insult me and say everything i say is an act, wrong, and manipulation. He said that nobody gives hormones to trans people, and that's malpractice and mutilation. Said it was illegal. Then he told my dad I'm brainwashed and need a psychiatrist. Pointed him to one. 

At this point I'm feeling like garbage and wanna kill myself. My dad is convinced that I am brainwashed. I told therapist that a friend of mine was killed in Bulgaria for being trans and therapist says nobody does this. Dad said parents probably hid **HIM** because they were too ashamed of having a crossdresser kid, and that nobody kills trans people. 

I tried to reason with parents but literally anything i told them i was met with, ""who is telling you to say these words? You're reciting things someone brainwashed you to say"". 

I got asked if i got AIDS, if i do hard drugs, if anyone in the Netherlands drugged me at a bar. I said no. They said that I'm lying and that someone told me to lie. 

Dad said that I'm stopping hormones and taking testosterone, and they'll make sure i do it, and supervise me so that i don't trick them. 

I tried to kill myself that night.

I've been updating my friends of this. A friend of mune offered a plane ticket and contacted an lgbt activist in my city.

next morning my dad was outside but my mom was showering. I packed my things and LEFT. i ran. I was carrying 20kg of luggage. Slept 2 hours in the last 3 days. Hadn't eaten since i came to bulgaria. Everything hurt, the temperature was hot as fuck but i RAN FOR MY FUCKING LIFE. Iran for 30minutes. I went to my friends place.

I called the lgbt activist, let's call him, idk, bob. Bob told me that the therapist i went to is working with psychiatrists who automatically pronounce you legally insane if you're trans. That way parents have full custody over you. Told me if im going to the psychiatrist that my dad got recommended, chances are I'm going to an asylum. Apparently its common practice here. Said to get the fuck out of the country as fast as possible.

I accepted my friends offer for a flight and we booked one for tomorrow.

I couldn't eat or sleep that night much either.

Next day comes. We're going to another therapist.

Turns out it's an endocrinologist. I notice that and get told I'm a stupid piece of garbage who can't understand words because I'm brain damaged by hormones.

Endo says everything but my reproductive health is fine, I'm not brain damaged and I'm otherwise healthy. Dad asks how we can stop hormones. She says either just stop or add clomid. Dad asks for a clomid prescription. I say absolutely not and endo says she can't help him. Dad is still convinced that i will die though, and tgat I'm brain damaged and told me we're going on clomid and he'll make me take it. He also said that I'm staying in Bulgaria until I'm fixed.

Then we're going to a therapist. I ask for their name. I google them. It's a psychiatrist.

I tell bob that. He says holy shit no. Says he can come to my location with lawyers. I'm not going to an asylum.

We had talked before so i was sharing my location.

We arrived. I see bob behind the corner, on google maps. We go in. Psychiatrist was quite decent and saud im fine and my dad has a big problem.

I was so fucking relieved.

Bob gave me money for a taxi to the airport, i gave him a short anonymous recording of my experience with the first therapist.

That night i flew back.

I got some money to survive the next month, and i can find a job in the meantime. I got a support group here. I'll be fine. I narrowly missed being taken to an asylum and forced on medications.

Drama with parents isn't over. But I'm safe here. I'll cut them off, at least for now.

Might have missed a lot of details because its all really muddy in my brain. Feels like a dream. Like something that didn't happen.",,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cv6gfi/my_coming_out_horror_story/

I recently came out to a lot of my friends and it was extremely positive and luckily my mother and sister have been positive but I’ve yet to tell my grandparents which ironically I live with them. Luckily I have a partner who has been nothing but supportive and is helping me become who I want to be and that makes me feel amazing. 

I guess what I’m asking for advice on is what’s the best way to go about telling family? If any plus size individuals just like me are around do you know where I can get clothes?

cvjaya,Some worries about hair growth/regrowth when going on HRT at 31,"Hi all! 

I'm turning 31 and hopefully soon will be able to start HRT which makes me super happy but I am super anxious about possible expectations of hair regrowth. I have some thinning on the top of my head (no bald spots yet fortunately) and a bit of male pattern baldness thing going on and while I could kinda otherwise pass after a while and with effort, I am very conscious of my hairline. 

I have a fairly big forehead and it would be nice to cover it with bangs or such but at this time the thinning is a bit too much to have enough hair for that... so I'm wondering if it can get reversed a bit or at least stopped with HRT? Google only leads me to the same article which says yes, and shows some great results, and yesterday I saw someone post a 4 month HRT results in which she said that hair is growing more thick/bushy now in places where it was not that thick before, but I'd like to know some more experiences to ease my anxiety :/ 

Also, I have long hair now and I've been wondering should I cut my hair short again to ""start over"" with hair growth or should I keep what I have and the possible regrowth/thickening will happen regardless?

Thank you :)",,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cvjaya/some_worries_about_hair_growthregrowth_when_going/

cvfg5g,How would I introduce a nonbinary character without it being clunky or forced?,"Say that I have a character who is nonbinary.

Now, obviously the characters are not psychic (well, in most cases at least, haha!) and wouldn't know that they were nonbinary, nor would they know that said character wanted to be referred to as a ""they"". (sorry if saying ""as *a* they"" is offensive)

So, if the character just met them, they wouldn't know right off the bat that they shouldn't refer to them as a he/she, especially if there's not another character around to refer to them as ""they"". So, how would I go about this? Would the character just correct them offscreen? If so, would there be a sentence about it, such a ""They also told me that they were nonbinary and would prefer if I referred to them as 'they'"". That sounds a bit clunky though.

Would they interject?

MC: But they said-

NB Character: *They*.

MC: Oh, sorry. *They* said...(yaddayaddayadda)

(Or they could also correct them after they finish their sentence)

&#x200B;

Also what if the character has a label under the nonbinary umbrella, such as genderfluid or agender? I mean it's not necessarily important to the story, but it would be nice to know. How would I say that in the story without it being forced or clunky? **(And without it feeling like I'm virtue signaling and pandering and trying to be politically correct)**

I'm kind of trying to be more casual about it. Like, not making it such a big deal (because it isn't). I want the characters to respond with ""Oh, really? Okay.""",nonbinary,writing,https://reddit.com/r/writing/comments/cvfg5g/how_would_i_introduce_a_nonbinary_character/

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvjc6c,I was attacked for using the ladies restroom - TW + NSFW,"Jaw is broken in multiple places. Nose is broken. Feeling really overwhelmed at the moment. I’m headed to surgery in a few hours.  

HRT - 2 weeks. 

It took so much courage to get to this point. I have been taking such good care of myself. Loving who I am and how I am looking. So happy with my life. I came to Oregon 2 weeks ago as a fresh start for myself. Somewhere where I could transition and really embrace this new life ... away from the pressures and expectations of anyone who has ever known me. 

I was blindsided/sucker-punched and then dragged across the ground by my hair. As I’m screaming in the fetal position, this guy continues to punch me in the head.  Thankfully someone heard my screams, ran over and got the guy off of me. Probably saved my life.  

Coming out as trans basically demolished my old life and everything that I knew to be real.  I’ve been rebuilding for a year.  I’ve been building an authentic and beautiful foundation for my life. 

It makes me so sad that humans can treat each other like this.  I didn’t say one word to this guy. I didn’t raise my hands or touch him. I never had a chance to defend myself. 

I’m really scared about my recovery and how all of this is going to effect my transition.  And any permanent changes I might see in my facial structure.   

My poor dog was in the car and saw everything. She got taken to the shelter and I never got a chance to say bye to her.  She is my best friend and has stuck by my side throughout all of this. 

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this ... I don’t know much of anything at this point. I guess I wanted to let people know what happened.  Ive heard stories about violence against transgender individuals but never expected something to happen to me.  I’ve been so liberated lately... presenting female even when I am pre HRT. 

I don’t want to live my life scared of how people will react to me. I just want to be happy and peaceful. Why is it such a challenge to live life as myself. 

This problem is not specific to me, and not even specific to the trans community.  We are a global community. We are all in this together.  What is different is not scary.  

I refuse to dim my light. I refuse to hate my attacker. I refuse to be anything other than myself.  Let us celebrate our differences. 

This is hard. Please pray for me, my surgeons my recovery.

Edit:  for those saying that I shouldn’t have been using the ladies restroom:  I didn’t even use the toilet.  Just washing my hands. Was in there for 45 seconds max.  It was also early in the morning with nobody around. I thought for sure that the bathroom was empty.  I never saw anyone in there. I was wearing women’s clothes!  

Apparently there was a women in the stall (who I never saw). She told her husband that I was stalking her and harassing her. (I only know this because the cops told me).  Additionally, the attack happened an hour after I used the sink. I actually left to get groceries, and came back. I was making breakfast and this guy walked 200 yards across the park to come assault me.  Can’t believe I’m actually defending myself to you guys.

cvlioo,Too many coincidences,"My high school class had 55 people, and about 22 of them are AMAB. Three of those people have transitioned. Two of them were best friends long before they both transitioned. I'm currently repressing having gender dysphoria, so if I transitioned I would be the fourth, making the AMABs in my graduating class about 20% trans.

I'm terrified that there is some kind of social contagion component to this. I want to believe that it's just a neurological difference or whatever, but there are just so many people simultaneously experiencing dysphoria. What if literally every guy I know is struggling with this too? Sometimes it seems that way. People post memes about the snapchat filter making them want to be a girl or whatever. In the social circles I'm in, I've watched people come out so many times that it can't ever surprise me anymore to learn that someone had dysphoria this whole time. And that's just transitioners, it's not even including boymoders and repressors. 

Thinking about this makes me absolutely terrified and literally keeps me awake at night worrying that if I transition I'll be betting my life that this is real, and not just some mass delusion. And if I don't transition I'll grow more and more masculine and probably end up cracking anyway. It feels like a life and death decision and there are no answers. There are no experts to listen to.

I don't get what guys here are bitching about. I was a skinny, nerdy-, coke bottle glasses, comic book reading kid from a little guy (9-12 years old). I quit playing baseball, and went through a real big artistic phase. I wanted girls to like me, and I was a loser in 7th grade. So, I just quit doing that, went the 'bad boy route' for a bit (wasn't truly me) but I earned respect, then in high school went ""full jock"" since they got the girls.

I'll never forget my fat friend Jason talking to me (He was a fat, pretty boy, but was rotund, so he wasn't getting top tier girls), ""Polojames, don't you want the girls? You play football, you get the girls"" and I still didn't want to play, but they were a year older than me, came by in their truck and 'dragged' me into summer practice, as soon as I started, I wasn't going to quit. I didn't know sh\*t, the same kids that hated me for the first 3 years of Jr. High(This was sophomore year) or saw me as a degenerate, after a good month, getting through hell week, got respect for me. I learned to play, got better, learned to talk, whiten my teeth, workout like a made man etc... And we were always talking to girls, all the time. Cheerleaders, sports girls, preppies, etc... I was a handsome kid, but weight lifting took me way up. Was getting girls, lost my V-card at 17. Etc..

Here's my point, why is everyone 'bitching' about girls that are 'hot' wanted the 'hottest guy', I mean, isn't that point of biology? I mean, that's how it works for all other animals, and we're animals, right? Also, I feel like most of the people I see in MGTOW, are kinda like, fat, loser, dumpy dudes, that bought into the lies of their mothers that ""Don't worry, since you didn't have the balls to wrestle, or play football, or learn manliness, you'll get a hot girl, or a great job, and that 'jock' stud guy, he'll be ""Bagging your groceries"" one day""... and a lot of you guys believed it. I had a former friend like that, he was shocked that I went to a better college than him, since ""Well, back in Jr. high, I hung out with these guys, and I started drinking at age 15"" to which I replied, ""Tom, you actually believed that bullshit? That I'd be broke and poor since I 'gasp' partied in high school?"" to which he was shocked, and got quiet. He did! He lowkey was mad, that I made it into a top school etc..(I cut his bitch ass out of my life).

&#x200B;

Point being, that's mentality I see here. It's kinda pathetic in my view. Also, this whole 'anti-women' thing, most of you guys couldn't even get a whiff of the hotter girls, cheerleader, superheroine, body built, prom queen, star soccer player, preppy girls. Or just 'hot girls'in general. So if you couldn't get them in high school, why would you get them in college, or in real life? I mean, how does that work? We've known since kids if you're fat, or ugly, or lame, you need to make a lot of 'money' to offset that. That's been trope in t.v. for like 50 years. Plus in real life, hence them selling us ""Bill Gates"" and how smart he was, as kids, since he could get any woman he wanted due to his wealth.

&#x200B;

Also, some guys have wife'd up girls 'out of their league' that in my view were 'wounded calfs' since they already had a kid with someone else, and a lot of those idiots were with her, since she was the 'former cheerleader' type, but this idiot, not only took care of her kids, but knocked her up. Now they're bitching about her cheating, or being a C\*nt, but she was always ""OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE, FAT BOY"" so, why are you shocked that she used you? or goes back to f\*cking Chad or Tyrone, who she really wants? I mean, it's like common sense stuff.

&#x200B;

I just would love to know if any of you see what I'm talking about, from a common-sense perspective. I'm not anti-MGTOW(I think it has it's merits) but the guys I see pushing are either losers that didn't do shit(sports) in their lives, or idiots that wife'd up the girls ""out of their league"" after she already had 2 bastard kids, then gave her 3 more, now they're bitching that 'it didn't work out, and child support""(though I feel child support laws are bullshit, word of advice, get married in Texas, if you go that route, they don't care about that liberal, BS) such as Angryman(youtuber) etc...

cvjmmx,So... I had 19 hours on the site before I realized I could mark down I was transgender on my profile. It was very flattering. Is it really that bad if I go back?,"I'm gonna go ahead and use my trans posting throwaway for this question. I'm a woman who happens to be trans, but I pass pretty well, don't really get clocked any more. I'm open about it, in that if it comes up in conversation I'll gladly talk about it, but otherwise, it tends not to play a big role in my life. 

I was told OkCupid was LGBT friendly, so I figured why not. I honestly kinda clicked through a lot of onboarding, figured that more options when I reached the gender section was for non-binary folks. Anyways, I gathered matches quickly, had some fun conversations. In one of these conversations, me being trans came up, the guy got mad, and asked why I hadn't marked it down in my profile. I apologized, realized I could do that, and did so. Well... all my matches disappeared, some leaving rude messages about trolling, most just ghosting me. Since then I'm not really matching with people, and some of the people I do match with seem to have some unfortunate ""expectations."" 

Now, look, I'm not gonna suddenly surprise anyone with a dick. But I do wonder if it would be better if I could explain that I'm trans in person, where maybe it would be less... I don't know, suspicious? More earnest? Less pre-judgey? I'm not looking for hookups so I don't think anyone would be expecting a vagina by the end of the night to begin with. 

I'm gonna guess the answer is a no. So I'm leaving it up for now. But any advice would be welcome.",transgender,OkCupid,https://reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/cvjmmx/so_i_had_19_hours_on_the_site_before_i_realized_i/
cvl057,"Has anyone else had basically no ""signs"" of being trans until soon before coming out?","So a little background, I already know I'm a woman, or at least trying to become one, and I've just started the initial processes of wardrobe changing, shaving routine, pursuing medication options, etc, and as much as I dread the social challenges inevitable with eventually presenting feminine in public, I'm almost excited at the prospect. But, even though I'm finally confident and secure in who I am, I can't help but sometimes look back and try and find any signs of being trans in my life.

Because I can't really think of...well, *any* indications until a few months before I finally came out to myself, not really anything for the years and years before then - no playing with girls toys, no wearing dresses, nothing like that (I guess I've always had like, a sort of disconnected feeling with myself, like I don't really know who or what I am, just never being happy with myself or in touch with myself?).

cvjuuk,"OkCupid, can't match based on sexual orientation anymore, they let you filter by gender instead. Online dating is colonized by gender ideology","I discovered what's in the title by finally deciding to make a new profile.

Here's the thing. In doubletakes (aka tender style swiping left and right) mode it's not possible to set up your filters based on sexual orientation. 

Let's say you're a lesbian looking to date lesbians and gay women (I don't get why they have both categories. Lazy programming?). Whether you use the app or the desktop site, what you will find is an option for the gender of people you want to be matched with. As a lesbian you could select women and cis-women (just this separation is insulting). 

You can also select not to see or be seen by straight people. (In the context of this trans mess, I now realize this option to not be seen by straight people is a clever way to make gender specials feel superior while allowing straight men and women to be spared running into TiMs every other swipe).

Now here's the problem. That's it. Where's the filter for sexual orientation? Nowhere. It used to be there. The most important filter of all.

So what happened? I answered about 60 questions with a gender critical slant. Next I did a lot of swiping and profile checking.

1 out of 30 Okcupid algorithm matches was a lesbian. My 2nd swipe showed a TiF looking for women. Pretty sure TiFs aren't interested in lesbians. Next one was a TiM interested in men. How broken can these algorithms be? Ok, numerous heteroflexible women interested in men. Lots of bisexual women (which isn't a problem in of itself. Except when I checked their profiles, most selected ""looking for men""). 

What kind of picture did this experience paint? Well, I was convinced all the lesbians abandoned ship. The trans & gender special takeover was complete. Trying to find anyone to swipe right on was a losing battle. 

Just for kicks I logged into my old (since 2013) OkC account. Went to swiping. Guess what? 95% of matches female women who have gay or lesbian on their profile. And some bi women who are only looking for women. 

I'm thinking my old account kept legacy sexual orientation based settings. I'm happy about it. 

The gender takeover is real. Lesbians going into online dating have to sift through an insane amount of non-women and women not interested in women just to find one that might be worth talking to. 

What do you think is the purpose of disallowing sexual orientation based filtering?

As an anecdote, I have a TiF friend who got into online dating with OkC. She was a pretty new member, didn't message often, and in a matter of months OkC offered her a position as a moderator.

I was a very active member for much longer. Never got any offer.

I suspect OkC targets trans people to moderate. So I wonder why lesbians are getting the shitty end of the online dating experience... with OkC being run by trans identified mods and all.

Thoughts? 

Anyone have a similar experience? How's your mileage with other dating services? Is there a dating service that hasn't been colonized?",,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cvjuuk/okcupid_cant_match_based_on_sexual_orientation/

I present more masculine and honestly I thought that being out about everything would make my life a bit easier.

I've never felt overly upset, more or less slightly uncomfortable, being called she/her, and often get called ma'am or miss at work which doesnt bother me much. I am just as indifferent being called sir or young man. I've always felt more drawn to the more masculine side of things, and most of the time find it more comfortable. The main thing I'm struggling with is the fact that I dont mind all the pronoun changes, I dont mind not binding every once in a while, and I dont mind changing between masculine, androgynous, and feminine aspects of myself.

I knew it was risky so i posted a disclaimer i had nothing against trans people, but the story still got replies.  One of which is from someone i have never talked to before and had plans to stay in a hotel with them in a few months. So bad first impression. We went back and forth, them calling me transphobic and me trying to defend myself as i thought it was funny.

cvlavg,My questions about Non-Binary’s,"Hi, I don’t mean to offend anyone, this is just a genuine curiosity between me and my sibling. 

Okay so I’ve never really understood anything non binary, all I know is that it’s when you don’t identify as a male or female. A lot of non binary people say that they don’t feel like a male or female, but what does that feel like? How do you not feel like a sex? What does that feel like? You can develop different personalities as a sex but that doesn’t mean you are not that sex. If you are female you don’t have to act feminine, that doesn’t define your gender.

 Or some say that had dysmorphia about their hips or lips, but how does that equate being female or male? That sounds more like regular dysmorphia, it doesn’t really seem gender related. I feel like it’s a thing based off of gender stereotypes since you say as a male you don’t feel masculine or you say as a female that you don’t feel feminine, but aren’t those based off of stereotypes? 

Sometimes non-binary’s say that they identify as “they/she” but how? why would you identify as both? Also what are with the pronouns like Xe, Hr, Xr and so on. It just confuses me. How could those things possible define you? I think people that identify as those are more so attention seekers.

How does it feel to ‘not belong to any gender?’ What would you define those feelings to be?

cut3bg,Do you think Gender Theory will go away?,"I think it might go away... If people will stop abandoning common sense, facts, and logic, to feel ''politically correct'' and so that they won't feel like racists, misogynists, bigots, homophobes, transphobes, etc... We need to speak up more, honestly. We need to use our reason and valid arguments and maybe people who are not indoctrinated to the gender ideology might listen to us if we tell them that it is okay to question ''affirming trans people'' and that they are not transphobes.

If you say that ''identifying as a woman does not make you a woman'', many will say that this is offensive to trans people and therefore transphobic but if you think of it, trans people out there like Blaire White and Kalvin Garrah aknowledge that gender dysphoria is a mental illness and that a trans woman will never be a biological female. So if you think of it, it is not dangerous to trans people. It is dangerous to the  ''you are valid'' thing. It is dangerous to the trans-ideologist's validity.

My country is pretty conservative, which means that only a 50% of people there accept homosexuality and in fact, a big percent of the ones who are not ''affirming'' are very homophobic or they have lots of prejudice against same sex attracted people. Mostly gay men, because when they think of the word ''gay'' they think of two muscly men, a dominant one and a passive one having rough, reckless, lustful anal sex with no emotion in it. They can't accept two men loving yet, how can they accept someone claiming they belong to a third gender?

I am kind of happy about that, even if it is hard for an LGB person to feel normal or to feel less alienated in a country that lacks acceptance. (Sadly...) I might be homoromantic, but I am still happy that my country (Greece) hasn't become like America where everyone is ''valid'' and everyone should be ''affirmed'' and where whoever does not ''accept lgbtqia+'' is a bigot, a transphobe, a rag, a dog, a piece of trash and nothing more than that. Because in reality, not everyone deserves your ''acceptance''. Not everyone should be ''affirmed''. Not everyone is ''valid''.

I look around, and all of my favourite youtubers, people who talk about things from fashion to animation and drawing have fallen for this stupid nonsense theory that ''everone's identity is valid'', that ''non-binary children rock!'', that ''He/Him lesbians are valid'', this validity theory that no one dares to question, because if he does it, then he is a bigot, a homophobe, a transphobe, an aphobe, a demiphobe, a panphobe, a polyphobe, and THE SON OF LUCIFER HIMSELF.

Love is valid. Denying reality, by calling it ''socially constructed'' just so you can justify your spiritual/invissible/soul essence of being a man/woman/genderless or multiple genders with an argument that has nothing to do with biology is not. I can't tell the difference between a man in a dress saying that  ''gender is socially constructed'' and a man in a dress saying that ''he is a woman at heart''. I think it is the same thing.",transphobic,LGBDropTheT,https://reddit.com/r/LGBDropTheT/comments/cut3bg/do_you_think_gender_theory_will_go_away/

I feel like it’s a thing based off of gender stereotypes since you say as a male you don’t feel masculine or you say as a female that you don’t feel feminine, but aren’t those based off of stereotypes? 

Sometimes non-binary’s say that they identify as “they/she” but how? why would you identify as both? Also what are with the pronouns like Xe, Hr, Xr and so on. It just confuses me. How could those things possible define you? I think people that identify as those are more so attention seekers.

How does it feel to ‘not belong to any gender?’ What would you define those feelings to be?

cvkrij,My problems with 13 being a woman,"I was making my fair share of angry comments last year after the casting decision, but now that I have actually watched season 11 and have had time to think about my opinions properly I thought I might make an actual post about the things that haven't changed. 

My main problem is with the issue of representation, which runs a bit deeper than just the argument of female vs male role models. On the surface I still disagree with building up a character and a demographic's attachment to that character just to give another demographic ""a turn"", but in the grand scheme of things attached as I am to the Doctor looking a lot like me that's a pretty selfish perspective and I easily concede it's not my right to want a brown haired, blue eyed white Doctor every time he regenerates. That would get kind of boring anyway. The issue comes from changing genders not actually being on the same level as changing even the colour of someone's skin. 

The Doctor is an alien and shouldn't be held to human concepts of gender, but when ""role model"" gets thrown around and emphasis is placed on the Doctor still being someone we as humans can look up to, I think it's a valid criticism to point out 13s regeneration as being a completely inaccurate portrayal of someone who has spent thousands of years in a male body waking up in a female one. Stepping outside of canon for a second writers are the ones that make the rules, and the choices they make represent what they want their audience to take out of their episodes. I appreciate the message of ""she is no different from any other Doctor"" but her lack of reaction doesn't send a good message to anyone questioning feeling uncomfortable in their own skin. Human beings are not designed to be happy with two completely different biological configurations. Men and women should be treated equally but they are not exactly the same. A woman being able to do a ""man's"" job is different to a woman being happy being a man. 13 being not a female adaptation of a character but a continuation of an existing character means we have the implication of gender being interchangeable on a personal level not a macro level, and that is blatantly false when applied to the audience. 

I think Missy's transformation from the Master was handled better. Although her flair for the dramatic is more of an innate character trait than one specific to her female incarnation I read a lot of her actions as those of someone trying to have a bit of fun in a body they are otherwise unaccustomed to. She kisses her childhood friend as a laugh because he doesn't recognise her and seems to find calling herself a ""time lady"" pretty amusing too. The lack of regeneration scene also gives me as a viewer plenty of room to fill in what I believe to be the inevitable panic after she realises what has happened and the subsequent period of figuring out what to do next. Even if you disagree with how I interpret her on screen interactions with the Doctor, they are ultimately interpretations and you can enjoy your own without affecting mine.

13 on the other hand has none of these characteristics. We watch her regenerate, and apart from a brief acknowledgement of her reflection as ""brilliant"" she carries right on with how she acted before. Although there are gaps in the series in which some contemplation could have occurred, the fact that we were shown the regeneration and never any other attitude from her indicates we are supposed to assume she's completely unphased by having an entirely different internal biology. Season 11 is very much ""business as usual"" for the Doctor. As a character we are supposed to look up to and potentially insert ourselves into this sends the (albeit unintentional) message that gender is not a big deal even when applied to yourself, when this is, in fact, the only time it should be a big deal. 

The reason I'm so hung up on this to begin with is because I'm part of the very small percentage of the population that is intimately familiar with the difference. I don't blame the writers lacking that experience nor do I wish knowledge of it on anyone but what they've done in season 11 is quite possibly the most thorough method of alienating me from a character they could have accomplished. I can point to watching Doctor Who when I was 11 years old and wanting to be the Doctor as one of the first concrete examples of not being able to happily grow up as a woman, before puberty wrecked my body and the line between men and women became so much thicker than when I was a child. Watching 13 is an encapsulation of everything I know I could never be happy with. She's not just a character I don't relate to (there's tons of those on TV who are interesting precisely because of their perspectives), she's a character I held very dear exhibiting indifference to the worst part of my life up until this point. That hurts. 

I'm aware that in this situation no one will ever really win. The number of women who wanted to see a female Doctor vastly outnumber the number of men in my position, and I don't for a second think that what I want is more important. I'm just disappointed in how things turned out. Ideally, keeping the casting the same, I would have wanted 13 to come to terms with things being different, not because others treated her differently, but because something wasn't quite lining up inside. It's hard to make that subplot accurate but also lighthearted enough to fit into the show without dragging down the mood, and I'm not about to pretend like I have the talent to write it up myself, but as it stands there was no attempt made at all and it's clear we are not supposed to take that interpretation of 13s regeneration. 

Basically, some of the stuff I'm bitter about is just that - something *I'm* bitter about that shouldn't be changed as a result of one person's annoyance. But some of the stuff regarding the show's concept of gender would benefit a lot more people if it was just slightly more representative of reality, and it's a shame that this is the road the current iteration of the show is going down. The saving grace is that every decision made by chibnall or any other writer is impermanent, so I know even though I'm unhappy currently the future is as blank a canvas as always. In the end that's one of the show's greatest strengths.",,gallifrey,https://reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/cvkrij/my_problems_with_13_being_a_woman/

cvjqzi,How do you have conversations about (questionable) trans representation in media with cis people?,"Contains mild spoilers for FX's Atlanta


How do you talk to cis people about trans representation in a show? How do you explain your skepticism of writers on TV to actually write good trans characters and not just use trans people (and esp. trans women) as props for jokes/gags/some other point they want to make in the show? What happens when someone takes offense to your skepticism? Did I overreact here today (which I'm pretty sure I didn't but let's be real internet validation is still nice).

Context for this: My brother and I enjoy watching TV shows together and we've been cranking through a lot of television lately. We just started FX's Atlanta today, which if you've seen it has a bittersweet/mildly uncomfortable scene in episode 2 with a trans woman who gets put into the male side of a jail, and meets an old ex-boyfriend while waiting there.

When we watched this episode, I had to brace myself a little because I didn't know what to expect and was prepared for a full-on transphobia celebration in the show, which may or may not have been unwarranted. What actually happens is both kind of sweet (the ex-bf is eager to catch up with the woman he hasn't seen in a while) and expectantly difficult (the other men in the jail all berate and laugh at the man who was talking to his ex). Now, this scene in question was challenging but also didn't seem in poor taste to me, and so I didn't really have any problem with that. However, it did prompt me to google search ""Atlanta FX show transgender"", which immediately spoiled me to another episode further on in Season 1, in which a main character tweets about how he doesn't want to fuck caitlyn jenner and ends up going on a talk show to defend himself against a panel that includes a trans health care expert.

Now, granted, I haven't even seen this episode yet, and I want to reserve judgement until then, but I found an article written by some blogger about the transphobia inherent in this episode, and I had to read it. I think my brother caught on that maybe I wasn't too thrilled with what I was reading because he asked me if something was wrong about the show. For context, he's generally a good person who isn't transphobic and is happy to drop or criticize shows that are exploitative/badly written/take advantage of marginalized communities.

When this conversation began though, it quickly devolved beyond the scope of the show. I was trying to communicate how reading about this future episode made me skeptical about whether I wanted to continue watching it, but ultimately I would reserve judgement on it until I got there. My brother was responding by saying the show's intent is often to highlight/make real the uncomfortable toxic masculinity/culture around hip hop and in the black community, and that showing and demonstrating the homophobia and transphobia through the show is both valuable and doesn't make the show transphobic/homophobic.

My response was to say, ""yes, but that still doesn't mean that for me, I have to be comfortable watching the show"", but at that point the conversation devolved quickly. My brother told me to not raise my voice while I was talking about how my perspective seeing transphobia like that on TV may be different from his, and that set me off and I told him to not dismiss or talk down to me just because something I see has an impact on my feelings. He got v. cold and did not want to respond further, pointing out that all our conversations now ended in this way where he was made to feel like he always said something wrong. I told him that this conversation wasn't about him, and that I think really pissed him off as dismissive.

Looking back, though, I don't actually think anything I said was wrong. A trans person *is* going to have a different reaction to seeing dramatized transphobia (not that it needs the dramatization) than a cis person, and as the trans person watching the show, I reserve the right to be skeptical of why a writer chooses to put that in to a show and skeptical of its real intentions/consequences. and I really did feel like he was making the conversation about him: all of a sudden, it was about how I was making him feel excluded or always making him out to be the bad guy, and it didn't even matter that I said I didn't disagree with anything he said about the show, just that I was still going to be skeptical, and that specifically as a trans person watching this show, I was 100% justified in that skepticism. And it bothered me how he said that all our conversations ended this way because 1. I don't think that they do and 2. if he feels that way, that is me putting effort into educating/discussing these things which impact me way more than they impact him and is not necessarily a bad thing?

I dunno, this long exposition is mostly to say, I feel like I tried to explain why I felt not great about transphobia in media that I watched, and then when I was invited to explain myself, it turned into a broader argument about how difficult I am or something for a cis person to be around. And from someone who I do really love and care about too! Has anyone else had this problem with cis people they are close to in their lives? If it was anyone else I'd be inclined to say ""fuck it"" bc I don't want to be in an environment where I feel like I have to police myself for the comfort of cis people, but in this case I really can't and don't want to do that.",trans women,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cvjqzi/how_do_you_have_conversations_about_questionable/

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

Can someone convince me otherwise because this has never clicked to me.",transgender,changemyview,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/

I'm a woman who happens to be trans, but I pass pretty well, don't really get clocked any more. I'm open about it, in that if it comes up in conversation I'll gladly talk about it, but otherwise, it tends not to play a big role in my life. 

I was told OkCupid was LGBT friendly, so I figured why not. I honestly kinda clicked through a lot of onboarding, figured that more options when I reached the gender section was for non-binary folks. Anyways, I gathered matches quickly, had some fun conversations. In one of these conversations, me being trans came up, the guy got mad, and asked why I hadn't marked it down in my profile. I apologized, realized I could do that, and did so. Well... all my matches disappeared, some leaving rude messages about trolling, most just ghosting me. Since then I'm not really matching with people, and some of the people I do match with seem to have some unfortunate ""expectations."" 

Now, look, I'm not gonna suddenly surprise anyone with a dick. But I do wonder if it would be better if I could explain that I'm trans in person, where maybe it would be less...

It feels like somehow I've been mischaracterized or pushed aside even though Contrapoints, as another trans woman, has absolutely no obligation to represent trans women or to share my same ideas or experiences.

I don't really know what to make of it.  Maybe Contrapoints' content has shifted and I'm not the target audience anymore.  Maybe I never was the target audience.

Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cv7v7f,The almost deadly misconception about keys going on right now and what I believe the max key will be this season.,"*By deadly I mean, you're going to destroy a lot of keys if you allow yourself to fall for it, inviting people you assumed were going to do well but there was no chance of it to begin with.*

First, how did S3's increase change from S2? If we assume a DPS increase of \~600 damage per ilvl from sims, the essences being a \~900 increase per ilvl (it's hard to value, I was trying to look through logs from S2-S3, then try to model, based on sims with HecticAddCleave what essence vs. no-essence looks like), then as it stands right now, **a full group at 440, provided they're not braindead, with 65 neck** at least in UR / FH / WM / SotS should be able to do well, as in, time them on 20, even 21 in some cases, but not even close on 22. The DPS allows you to just smack through trash and even avoid certain mechanics regardless of the void week.

That is to say, regardless of the dynamics of a key, you missing some interrupts, a few deaths, etc., these people should have enough DPS to pull you through. In essence, a 20 right now is not hard at all.

Second, not a lot of people are playing. Your score of \~2.5k is going to be reflected as very high when in reality, it isn't. I've been observing a lot of ""baddie"" players from S2 that miss awarness, co-ordination, being proactive and so on do 20s. Again, that is because they're easy, not because they're skilled enough.

Yet the score rewards them with a shiny number. We went into so many 19 FHs where a lot of people didn't know how to do well on virtually every boss:

* First boss: no kiting from DPS when healer couldn't. No proper reposition when pattern changed.
* Eudora: DH virtually no blade dances for powder shot, ranged not using the LoS, druids not shapeshifting barrels
* Shark: DH not using blur to maximize damage, getting hit by charges (not knowing there's 2 charges is very, very common)
* Last boss is kinda ok, didn't see much failing there.
* Virtually 50% of interrupts are missed. Now, this is a bigger problem with the players just being good but people at 2.3k, you never hear them pre-select interrupts, call things or co-ordinate. It's just a silent ""hey whatever"" type of run.

This type of shit gets you to 2.5k because of easy the keys have been due to the power increase.

Knowing this, paired with the new multiplier, I think that we're going to see a max of 25-26 keys being done this season but I'd say 26 is an outlier because the scaling difference from a 22 to 26 this season is +419%. I don't think 450, even with being generous with essences covers that. 25 is a 290% increase which seems to line up.

So, optimistically: 26s are the max, realistically 25s but most likely most ""top"" people, unless we're talking about top 50 will be at 24.

What does this all mean?

# The scaling of this season gives you the impression that you're closer to the top(~50, if they were playing) people, when you couldn't be further from the truth. Score mattered in terms of hundreds in S2, now it's a matter of dozens or max ~200.

I'm not calling the people at Blizzard genius for having come up with the emissaries to help homogenize keys level, but people need to stop looking at S3 score, it's absolutely meaningless when trying to determine the skill of a player. I'd say, based on careful observation and, well, tons of destroyed keys, that the **cutout for ""decent"" is at \~3k+ S2.**

Everyone at the not braindead level, at the current ilvl, with major fuck ups, can get to \~2.5k. I understand a lot of people will down-vote me because I'll be trashing their achievements, but, sorry, keys have been homogenized in such a way that the jump from 21 to a 22 is as high as a 20 to 23 in S2 and there's a lot of chaos because people don't know this.",,CompetitiveWoW,https://reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/cv7v7f/the_almost_deadly_misconception_about_keys_going/

Should Portugal bother with it, no. We have more and bigger problems with little money to solve them. If you are a trans teen going through sex change, lets say Female to Male, then go to Males bathroom while transitioning from 1 sex to another.

cv96iy,Introducing myself (and a lot of venting out),"Ok, this is my first post so I'm not sure how to go about it, excuse me in advance for the mini-novel. I just recently started to come to terms with my gender identity, although I knew I am not a man since I was like 15, that's 12 years ago. It started in the silliest way, with a Halloween costume, I and a few friends dressed as women, and I still remember I felt right, like never before that. I already had long hair since I was a kid, and I was never interested in boy hobbies and play, but I never thought about it much. But that night was so amazing. I started wearing makeup and nail polish on a daily base, it was the goth fase, and I encountered so much hostility in my home town that it broke me. I also have borderline personality disorder and at the time I was experimenting a lot with drugs, so that plus the beatings I was getting on a weekly basis made me forget that part of me to survive. I was also a fervent catholic (strange I know) and that made me so ashamed of myself I started to cut myself as punishment. One of the most burning memories is of a very close friend of mine, after I kissed a guy on a party he came to me and said he'll hit me if he sees me doing something like that ever again. I just accepted it as normal, for years I didn't even ask myself what's going on with me, mostly because of fear of rejection. I passed 10 years of severe depression, although I stopped using drugs, I mostly had a job, my life was kinda taking a turn for the better but I was frozen in that miserable state and couldn't move an inch. At 20yo I got out of a seriously f**ked up relationship and for years i was alone, thinking who would ever want to be with such a human wreck, and after I tried to get a relationship going, she slapped me with the statement: you're not man enough for me. That's the last straw that cracked it all again. I was so depressed that every little stupid thing would make me cry, I would wake up crying, I even had to quit my job because I couldn't function properly anymore. Then it all came back to me, and I started questioning myself again. I'm still not sure who I am becoming, a lot of the homophobia and transphobia from my surroundings still sticks to me, but I finally started again being who I am. I had to change country six months ago to be able to do that, but even though at the moment I am alone as never before I am the happiest I have been in more than ten years. I can finally wear nail polish and make up even though I am visibly male, my roommates and a few colleagues who I came out to are supportive (it's such a pleasant surprise) and after the summer when the workload is lighter I want to start seeing a gender therapist. I don't know for now how far it goes, am I transfeminin, nonbinary, demigirl, all those words seem so confusing tbh, but I know I feel better than ever. Sorry for the rant, this was written in the fire of the moment, after lurking on reddit for a while, all of you made me finally feel like I'm not an abomination, thanks for that.

cv6tcf,LGB people being guilted into having sex with trans people,"Hello! I’ve posted here before, but there have been a couple things on my mind lately. 

Over the years I, like many others, have seen an influx in trans people guilting LGB people into having sex with them. They throw around words like ‘transphobia’ and ‘TERF’ to silence people who just state with whom they want to sleep with or not. 

Lesbians are a common target of this; they’re shamed and ‘cancelled’ online because they don’t want to have sex with a penis or a surgically created vagina. 

Gay men are expected to be attracted to a girl in a hoodie and baggy jeans just because she ‘identifies’ as male. 

A response I often see from this discussion is that trans people should ‘just date a bisexual’, but what people seem to forget is that not every bisexual person is into that at all. Some bisexuals are, sure, but plenty of bisexuals don’t want to have sex with surgically created genitals or genitals which don’t even belong to the ‘gender’ their partner claims to be. I am bisexual, and I’m attracted to men with penises and women with vaginas. That’s it. I’m done needing to ‘include’ you into my sex life because some people like me do want to fuck you.

cv5d9j,Eating troubles and detransition.,"Hi, I've never posted but I read everyones posts on here often. Thanks mods for maintaining this subreddit.

I started reidentifying as female approx 1 year ago after just over 3 years of T.  I'm 21. I had anorexia before and while I was on T. I always saw it as something I had to do to keep my dysphoria in check because I couldn't get top surgery, sort of a necessary sacrifice to feel ok. I don't know if it was actual anorexia or a maladaptive way of coping with dysphoria, but I suppose it doesn't matter.

Its sort of flared up more recently. I find female fat distribution extremely difficult to deal with. People say you can't feel fat, but I think you can phsyically feel it (but it's not an emotion). I don't know how to properly manage having more weight because it will ""feminise"" me, I can tell.

I'm worried if I go to the eating disorder services they will encourage me to restart the testosterone because of my dysphoria around my body. I sawthem before while I was on T. I don't know of anyone who has had gender dysphoria in these ED services and not had transition encouraged as part of recovery. I think if I reject affirmation that might be viewed as non-compliance and you might be familiar with what that can mean (kicked out of programme or if underweight force fed).

Thing is, I know they will tell me to gain weight, I don't disagree that I need to so I don't really need them. Instead I need to figure out how to gain weight and cope with the female fat distribution.

Because of this I feel like I haven't suffered enough. There are so many trans people who need half a decade and more until they're somewhat okay. And even then many still need to make precautions, be careful, invest lots of other effort, and pay thousands of euros. Many will always live with dysphoria. Many also need painful surgeries that require life-long maintenance and I can do just fine without.

But at the end of the day I have a long and very painful path behind me. Already as a small kid I showed feminine behavior and for some time even saw myself as a girl. For that I was harassed severely for years and my parents outright abused me for it. The whole thing about *""men don't cry""*, *""don't be such a coward""*, *""man up""*, combined with physical stuff, and probably a lot more that I repressed because it was too painful. I only found out that being trans is a thing when I was 13 and from there on it only got worse. I couldn't come out because I lived in an ultra-conservative shithole. I had not a single person I could trust. I could never be myself. I didn't dare to out myself for ages. Even when I was forced to I received zero support. I was denied medical treatments that would have saved me a lot of pain down the road *(trust me, electrolysis for beard removal is just about the most painful thing I've ever experienced)*. When I went to a psychologist full of hope I was only further abused and discredited *(just a confused boy and I don't know what I talk about and so on)*. My father did more abusive things too to outright telling me he would rather kill me than have a son that looks like one of these faggot trannies. And even when I got away I had a shitty path. I needed to get two psychiatric evaluations *(which both concluded I'm perfectly mentally healthy despite literally having bipolar, autism, and CPTSD)* and I had to go to court and pay 1400€ and it took an entire year just to change my name and legal gender. The incompetence of endocrinologists in my area is bordering malpractice. I'll have to endure 50 hours of getting electrocuted in the face to get rid of these pesky follicles and to get that I had to fight my health insurance through 4 formal requests over 11 months and go to social court just for them to pay 70% of the costs for 20% of the needed sessions which now forces me to make a 5^th request and potentially sue again to get what is medically necessary. I was even denied jobs because of it and many doctors and therapists immediately refuse treatment when they find out I'm not cis under the premise of not knowing enough about it *(which is absolute crap because transwomen work 99% like ciswomen and the 1% we work like men, we aren't some weird alien species, my headache or flu don't require trans-specialized care)*.

Yet, I feel like I haven't suffered enough to the point where I almost envy other trans people. I know it's wrong and I shouldn't and that I had more pain in my life that any human should have to endure. But the feeling is still there.",transphobia,CPTSD,https://reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/cvl1uw/feeling_like_i_havent_suffered_enough_trans/
cvdlki,Pseudoscience in the vegan community really bums me out,"I need to rant, and this is the only place where I can. If I say it to my vegan friends, nearly all of them will say that I'm wrong and that what I'm railing against isn't pseudoscience at all. If I say it to my nonvegan friends (some of whom are very rational when it comes to topics that aren't carnism), in their minds it'll confirm that veganism is a joke rather than a very serious ethical position. Hell, they might even conclude that it's some nutritional deficiency causing it. I'm a man without a country, as if veganism wasn't alienating enough already.

I went to an animal rights march this weekend. I met one person who told me that she was studying reiki. Sometimes I think that these things are pretty harmless, so I simply told her that I didn't believe in that, and how I look at it like prayer. But I also met a vegan who was actually, legitimately schizophrenic -- he kept on saying increasingly bizarre things, like that he talked to aliens and that the moon is hollow, and then I started asking him questions -- who went off his medication two years ago when when he became a vegan. His parents are trying to get him into a psych ward, according to him because they don't like him.

In as nice a way as I could, I told him that he should really go back on medication, and how my grandmother was schizophrenic and lived an absolutely miserable life. And then THE FUCKING PERSON SITTING NEXT TO ME was like, ""Nah, don't do that, Big Pharma's out to get you!"" And she talked about how she recently visited a medium and believes in ghosts. Jesus fucking Christ.

I know a a vegan who prays over animals who have died in order to bring their soul into the next life, and who reads Tarot cards, and another who just today posted something about the government assassinating a physicist who invented a machine that produces more energy than you put into it, and still another who believed that the government assassinated someone who cured cancer.

Virtually everyone I know who's a vegan believes bullshit like this. (The more I think about it, the more examples come to mind, but I'll stop listing specifics.) It's fucking infuriating, and it makes veganism look like a joke.

For a long time, my only understanding of the vegan community was from this subreddit. Pseudoscience gets denounced here pretty quickly, which I appreciate. I used to be hopeful that the other posters complaining about irrationality in the larger community was fabricated or exaggerated, but now I know that it's real and pervasive.

I'm at a loss. I don't want to criticize their beliefs, because we're already such a minority, and group morale is vitally important to doing effective activism. But fuck me if this isn't driving me insane. Is it too much to ask for evidence for all of these wild claims? How are we supposed to convince people that a plant-based diet is healthy when we tell people that juice fasts extract toxins?

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvjc6c,I was attacked for using the ladies restroom - TW + NSFW,"Jaw is broken in multiple places. Nose is broken. Feeling really overwhelmed at the moment. I’m headed to surgery in a few hours.  

HRT - 2 weeks. 

It took so much courage to get to this point. I have been taking such good care of myself. Loving who I am and how I am looking. So happy with my life. I came to Oregon 2 weeks ago as a fresh start for myself. Somewhere where I could transition and really embrace this new life ... away from the pressures and expectations of anyone who has ever known me. 

I was blindsided/sucker-punched and then dragged across the ground by my hair. As I’m screaming in the fetal position, this guy continues to punch me in the head.  Thankfully someone heard my screams, ran over and got the guy off of me. Probably saved my life.  

Coming out as trans basically demolished my old life and everything that I knew to be real.  I’ve been rebuilding for a year.  I’ve been building an authentic and beautiful foundation for my life. 

It makes me so sad that humans can treat each other like this.  I didn’t say one word to this guy. I didn’t raise my hands or touch him. I never had a chance to defend myself. 

I’m really scared about my recovery and how all of this is going to effect my transition.  And any permanent changes I might see in my facial structure.   

My poor dog was in the car and saw everything. She got taken to the shelter and I never got a chance to say bye to her.  She is my best friend and has stuck by my side throughout all of this. 

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this ... I don’t know much of anything at this point. I guess I wanted to let people know what happened.  Ive heard stories about violence against transgender individuals but never expected something to happen to me.  I’ve been so liberated lately... presenting female even when I am pre HRT. 

I don’t want to live my life scared of how people will react to me. I just want to be happy and peaceful. Why is it such a challenge to live life as myself. 

This problem is not specific to me, and not even specific to the trans community.  We are a global community. We are all in this together.  What is different is not scary.  

I refuse to dim my light. I refuse to hate my attacker. I refuse to be anything other than myself.  Let us celebrate our differences. 

This is hard. Please pray for me, my surgeons my recovery.

It was also early in the morning with nobody around. I thought for sure that the bathroom was empty.  I never saw anyone in there. I was wearing women’s clothes!  

Apparently there was a women in the stall (who I never saw). She told her husband that I was stalking her and harassing her. (I only know this because the cops told me).  Additionally, the attack happened an hour after I used the sink. I actually left to get groceries, and came back. I was making breakfast and this guy walked 200 yards across the park to come assault me.  Can’t believe I’m actually defending myself to you guys.

cvg12o,Transphobia at “LGBT-Friendly” Barbershop (Bishops),"Well, I finally went to get my first haircut since I realized I was trans over a year ago.  I’m down in the Bay Area at the moment, and I figured I might as well check out Bishops when it isn’t an hour’s drive to the nearest location.  I make an appointment, and enter my name and gender.  There’s a separate entry for gender, and it all looks fine at the moment.  After all, their website advertises how LGBT friendly they are, and they’re a partner with Strands for Trans.  They’ve gotta be fine for a non-passing trans woman, right?  Right?

Despite my appointment being with one stylist, I was passed to another who “caters to mens haircuts” (that’s a quote from his LinkedIn profile).  I show him some pictures of what I want, and he responds by showing me a series of pictures of men with beards, all from sites named “MEN HAIRCUTS MAN MALE MANLY DUDE” or some similar over-the-top gendered bullshit.  I spend the entire time micromanaging him to keep him to the pictures I showed and not what he “caters to”.  He misgendered me many, many times, despite being reminded with increasing force every single time.  You’d think he would have gotten the idea that the person who marked down “woman” on her appointment sheet might want to be referred to as such, but he was absolutely dedicated to catering to men’s haircuts, and little things like “decency” and “reminders” will not stand in his way to deliver a haircut to a young man!

Maybe it’s a stretch, but I believe an “LGBT friendly” barbershop needs to set their goals a LITTLE higher than “trans people barely hold back tears and cut off the haircut in the middle so they can escape”.  A lofty goal, I know.  Real reach there.

I doubt I’m setting foot in a Bishops again if that’s the way they treat trans people.  The haircut was fine, I guess, but I can do without the transphobia on the side.",transphobia,TransyTalk,https://reddit.com/r/TransyTalk/comments/cvg12o/transphobia_at_lgbtfriendly_barbershop_bishops/

cvitn2,"Why is being transgender not a psychological disorder? If gender is a social construct seperate to sex, what does it even mean to be a man/woman? Aren’t all ways a person presents and feels through the lens of gender just a cultural norm that should be completely discarded?","I support trans people and trans rights, but I do not really understand. I am a feminist and I believe that feminine traits do not make you a woman and masculine traits do not make you a man. I reject the concept of gendered traits almost entirely because no woman should be expected to behave, think, present, or feel a certain way and visa versa. A man should be able to act and feel like the 50s stereotype of a woman because gender norms are a construct that I reject. But the man in this example is still a man, because of his anatomy. What does it even mean for him to say “I am a woman”? He is of course free to live as a woman and change his name and even change pronouns, but to them say “I am legitimately a woman” does not really make sense does it? Doesn’t this reinforce the legitimacy of gender norms, roles and expectations to say “I feel feminine and want to present feminine, which therefore makes me a woman because that’s what a woman is”? I mean no offence and am open minded.

EDIT: the question as to why being transgender is not a disorder has been answered. My question at this point is 
a) how can I square being a feminist and supporting the transgender cause?

I'd trained this guy to work on the phones. He was probably a good 10-15 years older than me so that might have explained his attitude.

I heard about it after it had all happened.

He was taking calls for one client and got a woman named Sally\* on the phone. Sally had a deep, masculine voice. It soon became obvious Sally was trans and this was in no way a scam. Well, the operator started saying something about how unusual her name was and from what I was told, he was not acknowledging her as m to f. Whether he meant it as a joke, I don't know, but Sally took offence. I wouldn't have blamed her for a second, to be honest. You just don't do that. 

As a consequence, he got fired. While I felt bad for the guy, I still question to this day whether the bosses thought I hadn't trained him well enough. The thing is, you can train operators for various scenarios, but this was something that had never happened before and I certainly would never have thought of it. Because I just never would have talked to her in that way. I believe in total respect and if someone with a masculine voice gives me a feminine name, and they pass all privacy checks, I don't question it.

I came to Oregon 2 weeks ago as a fresh start for myself. Somewhere where I could transition and really embrace this new life ... away from the pressures and expectations of anyone who has ever known me.

Is it really that bad if I go back?,"I'm gonna go ahead and use my trans posting throwaway for this question. I'm a woman who happens to be trans, but I pass pretty well, don't really get clocked any more. I'm open about it, in that if it comes up in conversation I'll gladly talk about it, but otherwise, it tends not to play a big role in my life. 

I was told OkCupid was LGBT friendly, so I figured why not. I honestly kinda clicked through a lot of onboarding, figured that more options when I reached the gender section was for non-binary folks. Anyways, I gathered matches quickly, had some fun conversations. In one of these conversations, me being trans came up, the guy got mad, and asked why I hadn't marked it down in my profile. I apologized, realized I could do that, and did so. Well... all my matches disappeared, some leaving rude messages about trolling, most just ghosting me. Since then I'm not really matching with people, and some of the people I do match with seem to have some unfortunate ""expectations."" 

Now, look, I'm not gonna suddenly surprise anyone with a dick. But I do wonder if it would be better if I could explain that I'm trans in person, where maybe it would be less... I don't know, suspicious? More earnest? Less pre-judgey? I'm not looking for hookups so I don't think anyone would be expecting a vagina by the end of the night to begin with.

cvkgmh,Denied an appeal for my top surgery insurance denial :(,"I am a 20yr old FTM who's been 8 months on T. I live in Ohio and I'm under my mom's insurance, Medical Mutual. At the beginning of my transition, I applied for coverage for top surgery which was immediately denied. So I had my trans coordinator at my doctor's office in Cleveland send in an appeal to see if the insurance would change their decision. I just recently, after waiting many months, got word back on the status of the appeal.

The following is the message I received from the trans coordinator at my doctor's:

> ""I'm sorry to report your medical coverage through Medical Mutual has a provision that excludes surgical coverage for the diagnosis of gender dysphoria therefore will not allow an appeal to the denial. Under these circumstances the only two options are self-pay arrangements or considering finding alternative medical coverage (if possible).""

I find it very frustrating that my appeal would be denied because my mom had a breast reduction some years ago (based on the basis of back pain) on the same insurance plan we're on now, and she had it completely covered. I have my own little collection of quotes and sources, all showing that Medical Mutual is to cover top surgery on the basis of gender dysphoria. 

I'm not saying that my trans coordinator didn't do her job right at all, I just think I need to confront my insurance directly about this. It's so frustrating to have to go through people and not know the details. I want to know what this provision is. I want to hear it myself. I'm prepared to show them all my research into why I should be covered if need be.

I simply cannot afford to pay for top surgery out of pocket, and switching to my own insurance plan will be a big hassle. Obviously if switching to my own insurance plan is the only option, I'll do it, but I'd prefer not to have to deal with all that.

Please, I just need some guidance on this whole situation if anyone can give me some. Navigating this by myself is tricky and I want to make sure I go about it the most affordable and least stressful way. Thank you.

cv4jre,What's the difference between androgynous and non-binary?,"I'm a 30F and have basically mainly 'male' interests although my personality is what I would call 'feminine'. Like, I pretty much only care to work on cars or computers (in anyway, all I really care to talk about, etc), but I tend to be receptive to how people are feeling or I'm a willing ear to listen to how they are (and enjoy it), which is commonly associated to being 'more' feminine (stereotypically, not 'reality' feminine).

For the longest time I thought this meant I was 'androgynous' because I also wore unisex clothes (for the most part, men's shirts and women's jeans, etc, or clothes that explicitly said they were unisex - my all-time go-to), and if anyone messed up and called me 'sir', I would never care (my pronouns are she or them), but with how ""non-binary"" is coming to mainstream (more accessible), I wonder if the correct term for me is actually non-binary even though I certainly look like an androgynous (assuming this is the older term for someone like me) person (still feminine, as I've been told it's obvious I'm a woman even when I'm as unisex as possible) with masculine interests or hobbies.

So I'm mostly asking this here to see what the difference between non-binary and androgynous is, and to see if maybe I'm using the wrong word for myself (aka, if there is a better word) given what I already said about myself

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvepqu,Gender Reveal Retreat,"This is a long one, but might help others? Maybe not, who knows?

So I'm 23, AMAB, and identified as male and straight for most of my life. Late in college, I started questioning my sexuality and discovered that I'm bi/pansexual. For the past 6 months, I've been experimenting with gender expression (makeup, femme clothing, nail polish, etc.) and questioning my gender identity. Slowly I started to get dysphoria about body and facial hair. I used to be very proud of my full beard and now can barely stand a day's worth of stubble. I started identifying as genderqueer about 4 months ago and that felt good and fit for a while, but recently I've been seriously questioning if I may be closer to a binary trans woman. If presented with the button, I'd slap the shit out of it.

However, several things have been holding me back from identifying as trans, and thus transitioning: 1) dysphoria hasn't been that bad yet 2) worried I'm a ""transtrender"" 3) wasn't a feminine child. That brings me to this last weekend. I've been stressing out over what I am for the past month and I haven't really had a chance to reflect on it all and really analyze these gender feels/thoughts. I had already blocked this weekend off since a friend was going to visit me, but she had to cancel. I decided to book an Airbnb near the beach (just a trainride from me) and take the time to work through this stuff. I dubbed it my ""Gender Reveal Retreat"" with the goal of better understanding my gender identity and not necessarily trying to prove or affirm that I'm trans, cis, NB, etc. My big takeaways from the weekend follow:

1) My dysphoria hasn't been that bad and it's relatively recent. I've definitely been influenced by some gatekeeping trans people that say you need dysphoria to be trans, but I've come to realize that's not everybody's views. Mia Mulder just made a great video called [""Transsexuals and Suffering""](https://youtu.be/5CW9GCN0X_w) about this issue which helped a lot. Ultimately, the conclusion I've come to is: I want to be a woman, but most of the time I don't feel like one, thus I have to transition. It will also hopefully alleviate the dysphoria which is steadily getting worse.

2) Being perceived as a ""transtrender."" I work in the theatre industry and many theatres have strong diversity and inclusion initiatives. For a while I thought that being a seemingly cis-het white man, there wasn't a place for me in theatre. Honestly, I started to blame my failures in the job market on affirmative action and diversity initiatives, when in reality I just wasn't applying like I should have been and the main cause of my failure was my laziness. This thought process is bullshit and toxic, but comforting for white men. Around the time of searching for a job, I started questioning my gender identity and playing with gender expression. Nobody else said this, but I kept asking myself if I was doing this to be more employable in theatre. After all, I could identify as bisexual and non-binary and still date women and dress a little bit androgynously (which I enjoyed), but still score ""oppression points."" So, was I just using these identities to take advantage of hiring trends? After reflecting on my job searching efforts and such, I realized that in 6 of the 7 offers I've gotten in the past year (in a variety of industries), I was presenting as a cis-het man in interviews. Further, of the 3 interviews I presented androgynously at, I only got one offer. So this admittedly small and anecdotal dataset kind of supports the opposite of what my self-doubt was telling me. Being a cis-het white man was an advantage rather than a disadvantage which people of color, women, and out queer/trans people know all too well. I'm just a fucking idiot sometimes. Also, statistically, if I transition I will be less employable.

3) I was trying to search my childhood and adolescence for hints that I was feminine. I decided to text a friend from high school who I hadn't spoken to in years and ask her. It was a long text, but essentially I said, ""hey, in high school, people would tease me about being gay or thought I was sometimes. I'm bi now, so just wondering if  you know why people thought I was gay back then?"" I didn't mention anything about gender stuff. She also sent back a long text, but the operative line was ""I think you did express yourself as feminine pretty often, and it probably did add up 'gay' in our teenage brains."" This hit me like an Ariana Grande hair whip to the face -- shocking, kinda painful, positively life-changing. In high school, I was deeply religious, homophobic, transphobic, and trying to act the most masculine than at any other point in my life. So, I was shocked that I was still perceived as feminine. It was so affirming to hear that because so many trans stories are ""I played with barbies and put my mom's makeup and heels on as a kid"" which was not my experience. Obviously this doesn't mean that you have to have been a feminine child or teenager to be trans, but it was still nice to hear and very affirming.

Bonus affirmations from the weekend: I used a picture of me in makeup (I don't pass in it) for my Airbnb profile, but still with my given male name. When I arrived at my host's apartment, she looked at me puzzled. I told her I was from Airbnb and she said ""Ohhhh I thought you were a lady by your picture."" So, a nice start to the weekend. I went to a brewery two of the nights and wore femme clothing -- just small shorts and femme t-shirts. I don't think I was passing, but it was dark and I got cat-called both nights, which wasn't great, but the affirmation was nice (I think someone posted on here about that specific issue today). The second night I went out, I put full makeup on and my clothing was more femme than the night before. It was still light out as I walked onto the subway platform, and a young man asking for money said to me, ""Miss, miss, can I have a dollar please?"" I was so happy at being gendered female, that I gave him all the cash I had (only $5, but he was very grateful and so was I).

Overall it was a great weekend! A relaxing mini-vacation that was much needed. I learned a lot about myself, dispelled some of the lies I was telling myself, and got some unexpected affirmation. If you're questioning, I highly recommend taking some time to yourself and really reflecting on your thoughts, feelings, and past without trying to prove you're one thing or another. 

All that to say, I'm now like 80% sure I'm a woman and want to transition. I'm going to take the next 3-6 months to confirm that, lose some weight, do research into HRT, and become more financially stable/get health insurance.

cvmc9h,CMV: Pride is overrated and has only done harm for the views on homosexual relations,"Let me get this straight: I got nothing against homosexual relations. However whenever I see pride flags flown all over town, companies changing logos and politicians getting flooded by their view on same-sex marriages it kinda gets oversaturated.

With pride being such a commercialised subjects it has turned into a marketplace rather than a right. Sure, you shouldn’t be shunned for homosexuality - but over sexualising everything about it does. Whenever I see pride walks I only see over sexualisation of everything and the homosexual community is at the end of the day only people who have a different sexual desire.

But when companies makes it into “support it or be hated” it gets demonetised. When politicians only care about homosexuals on pride day and don’t give a shit the other days of the year it feels like a forced measure.",,changemyview,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvmc9h/cmv_pride_is_overrated_and_has_only_done_harm_for/

ctxxoo,What's the difference between imbeciles who call Joe Rogan right wing for simply talking to right wing dudes on his show and chapo checks here?,"This is my first post here but I've lurked for some time now (don't post much in general). As of late I've noticed in threads here and there people just saying ""chapo check"" without really adding anything else. All it seems to serve is a decent chuckle at best when used with proper comedic timing, but more often it seems like it's just there to stifle conversation or entirely dismiss posts. 

It's employing the same idiotic notion that merely interacting with someone means you share all of their views. You can say ""it shows karma/lost"" as evidence of sharing beliefs or some shit but all it takes is one post to skyrocket total karma up or tank it down in any sub, so that doesn't seem like a valuable metric to go by.

It's the exact same guilt by association hivemind bullshit that makes people on other left leaning subs fucking insufferable to read sometimes with accusations of being a Nazi or whatever directed at some random guy who says they have a republican friend or something. If people have a demonstrated history of *everything* they say being obnoxious chapo shit, then by all means, call them out on it. But in the same vein of why I'm not a huge fan of reddit masstagger for blanket judgements of people who have   posts in right leaning subs that may not necessarily share the same beliefs as other users there, chapo checks aren't of much actual use besides shitposting and ""othering"" users based on *where* they post, completely disregarding *what* they post.",,stupidpol,https://reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/ctxxoo/whats_the_difference_between_imbeciles_who_call/

Where I was discussing that trans activists intentionally or not, misleads people. Thinking that dysphoria is feeling bad about ""real"" flaws. And dysmorphia is feeling bad about things that are ONLY imagined. I cited sources and dictionaries to prove it wrong. That dymosrphia consists of both real and imagined flaws.

It got a dedicated thread on a trans subreddit. Where they told me I was wrong. WITHOUT citing any sources. Just what they feel the word should mean.

cvcyzm,Revisiting the Disappearance of Sharon Ivy Jones,"As part of my renewed effort to draw more attention to cases involving minority victims, today's write up is one I first submitted to this sub two years ago. In that time, there hasn't been any movement in Sharons case, but perhaps getting the information out there again will spark some new interest in her story.

Sharon Ivy Jones went missing from a city that's only 10 minutes from my city. All the streets and the elementary school are places I know. It's making this case feel a bit personal to me. I also wanted to say that I'm not doing this for upvotes. I'm doing it because somebody needs to.

Sharon Ivy Jones is a 33 year old African American woman. She disappeared from Norfolk, Va on September 22nd, 2002. At the time of her disappearance she was the mother to a two year old daughter. Sharon attended Norfolk State University and was employed as a teacher's assistant in a preschool program at Lynnhaven Elementary School.

On the day Sharon went missing she attended a friend's wedding and then went to a dance party with some friends. She left in her red Toyota Tercel at 3 a.m. and she was last seen on I-64 heading westbound towards Chesapeake Boulevard. She may have stopped at a Taco Bell on the way home, but there's no way to know if she did or not.

The father of Sharon's child was expecting her to come pick up her daughter, but she never arrived. This was most likely the first red flag that something was wrong. Sharon is described as being a very devoted mother. Sharon's daughter now lives with her parents in New Jersey. Her family also says she would never leave without telling them and she kept in contact with them regularly.

Her parents and investigators went to Sharon's Breezy Point apartment. They found Sharon's car in her assigned parking spot. Her apartment door was discovered unlocked and there were obvious signs of a struggle in the apartment. Both telephone cords had been pulled out of the wall and some things in her apartment had been broken. Sharon's parents found the outfit she had been wearing that evening. None of her personal belongings were missing and her bank account has not been accessed since her disappearance. Her parents and younger sister traveled from New Jersey to Virginia to look for Sharon. Unfortunately, Sharon's younger sister passed away in 2003 without ever knowing what happened to her big sister.

Sharon is 5'4 and 130 pounds. She has brown hair, brown eyes, and a widow's peak. She has a Tweety Bird tattoo on her right upper arm near her shoulder. She also has a round vaccination scar on her left upper arm. The tattoo and the scar will help recognize or identify her.

So what happened to Sharon? Disclaimer: My theory is pure speculation. I think someone was waiting for her either in the parking lot, near her door or somewhere outside the apartments. Maybe they had her unlock the apartment and go inside where a struggle occurred. There was no mention of blood being found in the apartment which makes me think whoever was involved either took Sharon away in their vehicle or made her walk somewhere. I find the walk part unlikely, but it is a possibility.

My second theory is that she either opened the door to someone she knew or she may have been tricked into answering the door for a stranger i.e., someone claiming to need help or some other story.

I just wanted to note that the links provide all contain almost the exact same info. There just weren't that many sources.

We hooked up and in the morning ""she"" told me she used to be a man. I thought they were just joking with me but after a few minutes of ""haha  very funny but theres no way you're being serious right now"" they pulled up some old pics on their phone to prove it.

I felt disgusted and angry but I contained myself and simply asked them to leave. 

I dont know how to process this or how I'm ever going to be able to trust someone again... ""her"" transition was very well done, there was no way I could have know just by looking at them.

cujxbj,Dom Sexual Assault Scandal,"Hi Everyone! I’m sure this might be a controversial topic on this sub but I wanna preface this by saying I am a recent VS fan, just started watching this year and I LOVE them. With that being said, being such a new fan...I feel pretty out of the loop.


Today I watched Trisha’s video about Jeff and the VS (I know, watching her video was my first mistake lol) and I was surprised to hear what she said about Dom allegedly holding down a girl at VidCon two years ago. Of course I had to look into it and I genuinely expected it to be a rumor or something–after all, why would an *actual* creep constantly joke and out himself as a creep? Anyway, after looking at all of the stories that came out...I legitimately felt sick to my stomach about it. The claims sound very valid and I personally have no doubt that they’re true.


Fans that were around in 2017...how was the general reaction? Was there backlash when David continued to feature Dom (and his gross jokes) in the videos? How do you feel about it now? Are any VS members not friends with Dom over this? 


I hate to say it...but I felt genuinely disappointed hearing that and knowing that David is still Dom’s friend and has no problem enabling his sexually inappropriate behavior for his vlogs. I know for a fact that I’ll feel disgusted every time David has Dom doing some dumb bit that focuses on him and a bunch of girls. I’m not trying to shit on David, I really like him and I know it’s not “easy” to just drop a friend.. but it’s kind of astounding to me that something like this could be so easily overlooked...which almost makes me feel like I’m missing something? 


Is there anything else I should know about the situation?


Ps please no hate for asking about this. I’m just out of the loop and would rather get opinions from real fans of the vlogs than just watch some dumb drama YT channel.",,DavidDobrik,https://reddit.com/r/DavidDobrik/comments/cujxbj/dom_sexual_assault_scandal/

cvjc6c,I was attacked for using the ladies restroom - TW + NSFW,"Jaw is broken in multiple places. Nose is broken. Feeling really overwhelmed at the moment. I’m headed to surgery in a few hours.  

HRT - 2 weeks. 

It took so much courage to get to this point. I have been taking such good care of myself. Loving who I am and how I am looking. So happy with my life. I came to Oregon 2 weeks ago as a fresh start for myself. Somewhere where I could transition and really embrace this new life ... away from the pressures and expectations of anyone who has ever known me. 

I was blindsided/sucker-punched and then dragged across the ground by my hair. As I’m screaming in the fetal position, this guy continues to punch me in the head.  Thankfully someone heard my screams, ran over and got the guy off of me. Probably saved my life.  

Coming out as trans basically demolished my old life and everything that I knew to be real.  I’ve been rebuilding for a year.  I’ve been building an authentic and beautiful foundation for my life. 

It makes me so sad that humans can treat each other like this.  I didn’t say one word to this guy. I didn’t raise my hands or touch him. I never had a chance to defend myself. 

I’m really scared about my recovery and how all of this is going to effect my transition.  And any permanent changes I might see in my facial structure.   

My poor dog was in the car and saw everything. She got taken to the shelter and I never got a chance to say bye to her.  She is my best friend and has stuck by my side throughout all of this. 

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this ... I don’t know much of anything at this point. I guess I wanted to let people know what happened.  Ive heard stories about violence against transgender individuals but never expected something to happen to me.  I’ve been so liberated lately... presenting female even when I am pre HRT. 

I don’t want to live my life scared of how people will react to me. I just want to be happy and peaceful. Why is it such a challenge to live life as myself. 

This problem is not specific to me, and not even specific to the trans community.  We are a global community. We are all in this together.  What is different is not scary.  

I refuse to dim my light. I refuse to hate my attacker. I refuse to be anything other than myself.  Let us celebrate our differences. 

This is hard. Please pray for me, my surgeons my recovery. 


[broken jaw ](https://imgur.com/gallery/12XUdlW)

Edit:  for those saying that I shouldn’t have been using the ladies restroom:  I didn’t even use the toilet.  Just washing my hands. Was in there for 45 seconds max.  It was also early in the morning with nobody around. I thought for sure that the bathroom was empty.  I never saw anyone in there. I was wearing women’s clothes!  

Apparently there was a women in the stall (who I never saw). She told her husband that I was stalking her and harassing her. (I only know this because the cops told me).  Additionally, the attack happened an hour after I used the sink. I actually left to get groceries, and came back. I was making breakfast and this guy walked 200 yards across the park to come assault me.  Can’t believe I’m actually defending myself to you guys.   Probably going to delete this post because fuck that.

Edit 2:  here are a few assumptions that I live by that may bring context to why I chose to do what I did 

- I live in a friendly universe 
- people are inherently good 
- I am valid 
- passing does not make me a woman. Being a woman makes me a woman 
- in general, I do not let the negative judgements of others dictate how I live my life 
- having stubble does not make me a perverted, scary monster. 
- Shaving my face does not turn me into a dainty cis fairy
- you do not need to be a certain level of passable in order to use the restroom
 
The alternative would have been using the men’s bathroom while wearing women’s clothes - the same bathroom that my attacker would be using. Another alternative could be hiding in a closet for the rest of my life.  

I walked in to wash my hands and walked out ... that’s it.  People saying that I should have known better and that I deserve this is really hurting my feelings.  

Thank you to everyone who is being supportive. This is why I came here. I’m going through this alone.  I am scared and really traumatized.  I normally don’t reach out for support.  this is a big deal and I wanted to share my experience.  I am trying to process. And distract myself.  

I made a judgement call based off of past experiences. I have used the women’s bathroom many times while “not passing” and have been completely embraced by the women inside.  I also perceived Oregon as being extremely accepting. That’s what everyone told me before coming here.  

I am peaceful and non-violent. If someone were to communicate with me in a non-threatening or demeaning way, i would validate their concerns and explain where I am coming from.  Pretty simple. 

Looking back, should I have acted differently? No.  Why should I hide who I am when I am hurting no one and doing nothing wrong.   I waited 29 years to embrace myself.  I’m going to take every opportunity I get to feel like me. 

People who are hateful, ignorant, non-accepting, violent and judgmental should be the ones acting differently.

I was blindsided/sucker-punched and then dragged across the ground by my hair. As I’m screaming in the fetal position, this guy continues to punch me in the head.  Thankfully someone heard my screams, ran over and got the guy off of me. Probably saved my life.  

Coming out as trans basically demolished my old life and everything that I knew to be real.  I’ve been rebuilding for a year.  I’ve been building an authentic and beautiful foundation for my life. 

It makes me so sad that humans can treat each other like this.  I didn’t say one word to this guy. I didn’t raise my hands or touch him. I never had a chance to defend myself. 

I’m really scared about my recovery and how all of this is going to effect my transition.  And any permanent changes I might see in my facial structure.   

My poor dog was in the car and saw everything. She got taken to the shelter and I never got a chance to say bye to her.  She is my best friend and has stuck by my side throughout all of this. 

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this ... I don’t know much of anything at this point. I guess I wanted to let people know what happened.  Ive heard stories about violence against transgender individuals but never expected something to happen to me.  I’ve been so liberated lately... presenting female even when I am pre HRT. 

I don’t want to live my life scared of how people will react to me. I just want to be happy and peaceful. Why is it such a challenge to live life as myself. 

This problem is not specific to me, and not even specific to the trans community.  We are a global community. We are all in this together.  What is different is not scary.  

I refuse to dim my light. I refuse to hate my attacker. I refuse to be anything other than myself.  Let us celebrate our differences. 

This is hard. Please pray for me, my surgeons my recovery.

Edit:  for those saying that I shouldn’t have been using the ladies restroom:  I didn’t even use the toilet.  Just washing my hands. Was in there for 45 seconds max.  It was also early in the morning with nobody around. I thought for sure that the bathroom was empty.  I never saw anyone in there. I was wearing women’s clothes!  

Apparently there was a women in the stall (who I never saw). She told her husband that I was stalking her and harassing her. (I only know this because the cops told me).  Additionally, the attack happened an hour after I used the sink. I actually left to get groceries, and came back. I was making breakfast and this guy walked 200 yards across the park to come assault me.  Can’t believe I’m actually defending myself to you guys.   Probably going to delete this post because fuck that.

Edit 2:  here are a few assumptions that I live by that may bring context to why I chose to do what I did 

- I live in a friendly universe 
- people are inherently good 
- I am valid 
- passing does not make me a woman. Being a woman makes me a woman 
- in general, I do not let the negative judgements of others dictate how I live my life 
- having stubble does not make me a perverted, scary monster. 
- Shaving my face does not turn me into a dainty cis fairy
- you do not need to be a certain level of passable in order to use the restroom
 
The alternative would have been using the men’s bathroom while wearing women’s clothes - the same bathroom that my attacker would be using. Another alternative could be hiding in a closet for the rest of my life.  

I walked in to wash my hands and walked out ... that’s it.  People saying that I should have known better and that I deserve this is really hurting my feelings.  

Thank you to everyone who is being supportive. This is why I came here. I’m going through this alone.  I am scared and really traumatized.  I normally don’t reach out for support.  this is a big deal and I wanted to share my experience.  I am trying to process. And distract myself.  

I made a judgement call based off of past experiences. I have used the women’s bathroom many times while “not passing” and have been completely embraced by the women inside.  I also perceived Oregon as being extremely accepting. That’s what everyone told me before coming here.  

I am peaceful and non-violent. If someone were to communicate with me in a non-threatening or demeaning way, i would validate their concerns and explain where I am coming from.  Pretty simple. 

Looking back, should I have acted differently? No.  Why should I hide who I am when I am hurting no one and doing nothing wrong.   I waited 29 years to embrace myself.  I’m going to take every opportunity I get to feel like me. 

People who are hateful, ignorant, non-accepting, violent and judgmental should be the ones acting differently.


Also, the police were completely supportive and are trying to bring as many charges as possible to the table ... including labeling this a hate crime.

cvm07v,Best friend not comfortable in her own body. How can I help?,"Hey everyone. 

First of all, I'd like to say I personally don't understand how she's feeling because I've never felt it, however I support and love her regardless of whether I understand or not. 

I don't have any experience dealing with transgenders at all so I'm basically clueless.

We got drunk the other night and she opened up about how she felt. She broke down saying she's not comfortable in her own body and has felt this way since she started puberty. I listened. I held her. I told her she can talk to me at any time whether it's during her breakdowns or after. I told her she needs to talk to someone because she isn't alone. I've always told her I don't understand but will always support her whatever happens in life. 

My question to you.. how can I help her? How can I try and understand properly so she doesn't feel alone?

ciixzi,"Is anybody else worried that Gen Z and younger generations are going to internalize ""right wing""?","Okay, I am left wing, I'm 39 years old, and I know accusations of me being right wing are bullshit. But had I been 13, I might be completely confused about where I actually stood. I would have figured that maybe I was center. Since I wouldn't believe in a lot of pomo ideas, and that's all the left wing appears to be on social media where young people are, I might decide the left is not for me. I wouldn't have the experience or context to understand the left outside of Tumblr, youtube and everywhere else. Would I conclude that everyone was right, and I really was right wing? I'm very worried about younger generations being told they're right wing all the time for common sense, or even leftist ideas, and then identifying with the ACTUAL right wing. Let me unpack that.

Say that a 15 year old who knows damn well that you can't change sex is dogpiled online for being a Nazi bigot. She's upset, she's unnerved, angry, and confused. Along comes a real right winger, of any degree, who is sympathetic to her and does nothing more than share common sense. This person looks not only super nice, but also super intelligent and wise. Even if this person is actually an idiot. Now the right wing looks sane, if not good. Add to that that while Contra Points has very polished left wing videos, and to his credit can be funny, they're too long, just as nagging as other SJW channels, and aren't as interesting as his older work. Meanwhile, right wing youtubers are entertaining, even if you are hate watching them. And they outnumber Contra Points and Kat Blaque. Contra Points puts way more effort into his videos, but gets invited to speak in far fewer places than Blaire White. That tells you something. There's also the thrill of eating the forbidden fruit of right wing media.

If you do a little googling, actual neo-Nazis have found sophisticated ways to appeal to young people. Gone are the out-of-fashion shaved heads and ugly tattoos. Now they have subtle, beautiful tattoos, tastefully hip clothes, interesting hobbies, photogenic spokespeople, and are even developing an Etsy style consumer culture. They're called Nipsters, as a matter of fact. They've dropped the menacing goon look, and the stuffy curmudgeon look. No boozy bikers, no Pat Buchanans. They even know how to look like very nice people, with environmentalism, volunteering at dog shelters, skepticism of capitalism (there are right wing theories for that) etc. They're not just country music/confederate flag/guns anymore either. Some of them look as urban as any Parisian or New Yorker. Goebbels was very good at appealing to people's vanity, fear, frustration, wishful thinking, and need for entertainment. He knew how to make Nazism chic. From what I'm seeing on the internet, Neo-Nazis are rediscovering his methods of gaining gullible followers. 

SJWs are making it very easy for the actual far right to gain traction. Right wingers just have to appear to be a teensy bit less stupid to look good by comparison, especially to a kid who doesn't know much. Kids need to know that there's nothing right wing in knowing that you can't change sex. There's nothing right wing (AT ALL) in knowing that gender norms are just cultural practices. There's nothing right wing about criticism of religion. There's nothing right wing in seeing pomo for the bougie bullshit that it is. And there's nothing right wing in being against porn and sex work.

I'm so frustrated that radical feminism is so inaccessible lately. The narrative is that we don't exist. There's only pomo and right wing.",,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/ciixzi/is_anybody_else_worried_that_gen_z_and_younger/

cvodxk,WIBTA if I told my brother his boyfriend is transgender?,"My (20m) brother (23m) is a dating a guy (also 20) who used to be in my class in school. The kid is ftm trans and has been transitioned for a long time (9+ years). The guy has presented fully male for as long as I've known him and you can't tell he's trans at all. He's around 5'9, has a jawbone to kill and grows a decent about of facial hair. However, he has not told my brother he is trans. In fact, the only reason I know he is trans is because there was a rumour going around school about him being trans, and I asked him directly when they first started dating, in which he confirmed he was but he hates talking about it. 

He and I had a conversation in which the bf said that he saw no need to tell my brother he's trans, as it's not like they're ever going to have biological children together, and he hasn't had to come out since he was like 11 as he has always been lucky enough to pass for male very well. He has had bottom and top surgery. He is also covered in tattoos, and his scars are very hard to see (I saw him shirtless at a graduation pool party a couple years ago). 

I know it's not my business to tell my brother, but he made it clear he is not going to tell him. I feel like this is important knowledge medically, and because I just feel my brother has a right to know. I don't think it would change my brother's opinion of him whatsoever, but I know he might be upset that his bf didn't tell him himself.

cvjqzi,How do you have conversations about (questionable) trans representation in media with cis people?,"Contains mild spoilers for FX's Atlanta


How do you talk to cis people about trans representation in a show? How do you explain your skepticism of writers on TV to actually write good trans characters and not just use trans people (and esp. trans women) as props for jokes/gags/some other point they want to make in the show? What happens when someone takes offense to your skepticism? Did I overreact here today (which I'm pretty sure I didn't but let's be real internet validation is still nice).

Context for this: My brother and I enjoy watching TV shows together and we've been cranking through a lot of television lately. We just started FX's Atlanta today, which if you've seen it has a bittersweet/mildly uncomfortable scene in episode 2 with a trans woman who gets put into the male side of a jail, and meets an old ex-boyfriend while waiting there.

When we watched this episode, I had to brace myself a little because I didn't know what to expect and was prepared for a full-on transphobia celebration in the show, which may or may not have been unwarranted. What actually happens is both kind of sweet (the ex-bf is eager to catch up with the woman he hasn't seen in a while) and expectantly difficult (the other men in the jail all berate and laugh at the man who was talking to his ex). Now, this scene in question was challenging but also didn't seem in poor taste to me, and so I didn't really have any problem with that. However, it did prompt me to google search ""Atlanta FX show transgender"", which immediately spoiled me to another episode further on in Season 1, in which a main character tweets about how he doesn't want to fuck caitlyn jenner and ends up going on a talk show to defend himself against a panel that includes a trans health care expert.

Now, granted, I haven't even seen this episode yet, and I want to reserve judgement until then, but I found an article written by some blogger about the transphobia inherent in this episode, and I had to read it. I think my brother caught on that maybe I wasn't too thrilled with what I was reading because he asked me if something was wrong about the show. For context, he's generally a good person who isn't transphobic and is happy to drop or criticize shows that are exploitative/badly written/take advantage of marginalized communities.

When this conversation began though, it quickly devolved beyond the scope of the show. I was trying to communicate how reading about this future episode made me skeptical about whether I wanted to continue watching it, but ultimately I would reserve judgement on it until I got there. My brother was responding by saying the show's intent is often to highlight/make real the uncomfortable toxic masculinity/culture around hip hop and in the black community, and that showing and demonstrating the homophobia and transphobia through the show is both valuable and doesn't make the show transphobic/homophobic.

My response was to say, ""yes, but that still doesn't mean that for me, I have to be comfortable watching the show"", but at that point the conversation devolved quickly. My brother told me to not raise my voice while I was talking about how my perspective seeing transphobia like that on TV may be different from his, and that set me off and I told him to not dismiss or talk down to me just because something I see has an impact on my feelings. He got v. cold and did not want to respond further, pointing out that all our conversations now ended in this way where he was made to feel like he always said something wrong. I told him that this conversation wasn't about him, and that I think really pissed him off as dismissive.

Looking back, though, I don't actually think anything I said was wrong. A trans person *is* going to have a different reaction to seeing dramatized transphobia (not that it needs the dramatization) than a cis person, and as the trans person watching the show, I reserve the right to be skeptical of why a writer chooses to put that in to a show and skeptical of its real intentions/consequences. and I really did feel like he was making the conversation about him: all of a sudden, it was about how I was making him feel excluded or always making him out to be the bad guy, and it didn't even matter that I said I didn't disagree with anything he said about the show, just that I was still going to be skeptical, and that specifically as a trans person watching this show, I was 100% justified in that skepticism. And it bothered me how he said that all our conversations ended this way because 1. I don't think that they do and 2. if he feels that way, that is me putting effort into educating/discussing these things which impact me way more than they impact him and is not necessarily a bad thing?

I dunno, this long exposition is mostly to say, I feel like I tried to explain why I felt not great about transphobia in media that I watched, and then when I was invited to explain myself, it turned into a broader argument about how difficult I am or something for a cis person to be around. And from someone who I do really love and care about too! Has anyone else had this problem with cis people they are close to in their lives? If it was anyone else I'd be inclined to say ""fuck it"" bc I don't want to be in an environment where I feel like I have to police myself for the comfort of cis people, but in this case I really can't and don't want to do that.",trans women,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cvjqzi/how_do_you_have_conversations_about_questionable/

cvibib,"Had a terrible experience the other day, was cornered by someone that insisted on asking 'are you sure you're not gay'. (TW: homophobia/transphobia)","I had an experience the other day that really messed me up. I don't even want to talk about it on my main account out of paranoia, so I made a throwaway.

So quick intro to me. I'm AMAB, currently present male, I'm pre everything, and am out of the closet to exactly one person.

So I had an interaction with this person I know on more of an acquaintance level. We were hanging out, and things started off fine. The beginning of the end was when she brought up her cousin. She literally brought it up completely unprompted. She started talking about how she was upset at her cousin because he came out as transgender and blocked her on Facebook. She then went on to continuously use his dead name and wrong pronouns. If I were to paraphrase, and TW skip the quote if you don't want to see transphobic talk:

""I just can't believe [Deadname] would do that. [Deadname] is my cousin, I love [him]. [He] shouldn't have blocked me, I just want to tell [him] that... [Deadname], I'll always love you, even if you want to be a man. [Deadname], I love you""

So I bit my tongue, because I didn't feel comfortable speaking up in that moment. She admitted that she 'doesn't know why' she brought that up, as I said it was completely random.

So we continue to talk casually about other things. We eventually get to my career, and she says something along the lines of 'Well at least because you're gay, you have an advantage' and I cut her off and told her I was straight. Assuming she meant 'gay' in the sense of 'I am a biological guy that likes other biological guys'. I told her that I have a girlfriend, have only had girlfriends, and have never been interested in being with a guy. I felt that was the simplest way to express my position to somebody that clearly doesn't understand LGBT+ issues.

She apologized, was embarrassed, and we moved on. But then she kept being it back up. She would eventually bring up 'are you sure you're not gay?' and I had to keep telling her no. She eventually WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE until I told her 'the truth' and was 'honest with [her]'.

It got bad, to the point of me being physically scared for my life. Thankfully, eventually, others realized something was up and intervened to separate her from me. I'm doing better, but I've been struggling to keep myself together. She unfortunately had access to my laptop at one point during the ordeal, so I don't know if she found my Reddit account, which is why I made a throwaway. If she started stalking me, I don't want to confirm it's my reddit account by sharing this story.

I don't know what I want or need by sharing this, but I just wanted to. I needed to get it out. And while I'm not out, I've made enough slips that she might have known enough to start pushing for information. The sort of thing where I accidentally leave open a girl mode selfie on my phone when someone walks by, or I lend my laptop to someone and forget /r/traaa is currently open on my browser. Things that I don't know if people noticed and are gossiping, or maybe I got lucky and nobody noticed.

We decided to smoke some weed on a bench in the city centre when we spotted some woman dancing in the streets like she got paid to do it (classic drugdancemoves). Eventually me and my friend asked her and the guy she'd been with for the past half hour if they were in for a smoke. They were and we ended up talking with them for 10 minutes. As it turned out they were high on blow but they were pretty chill to hang out with (at least he was, she couldn't stop dancing and didn't speak much). I invited them to my house and my friend immediately tried to talk me out of it and said they'd probably rob me or some shit. He went home but I still invited them in. 

The entire night they were here they were crushing up ritalin pills I had left and snorting them. She was dancing through my house naked and masturbated in my bathroom for half a hour when I offered them a shower and gave them clean shirts. I threw some fries in the oven for them too.

I spent most of past Saturday with the guy still on my couch smoking weed and drinking beer with him. The woman went out to find money and at one point she came back, high on blow and asking for more money. The guy bursted into tears and it was at this point that I thought to myself ""what mess have I gotten myself into this time?"". She went out a couple more times and came back a with money or food every time. She even came with a bag full of clothing from the homeless shelter at one point. It's still here.

These people had the hardest lives of anyone I've ever met. But the guy was so thankfull for me inviting them to my house, giving them food and shirts and letting them shower that he cleaned my room for me and mopped all the floors in my house.

cvop2u,Transphobic roommate doesn't know I'm trans lol,"Basically, I have a randomly-selected roommate and his family is transphobic. I met his family as well as him and we got along perfectly. Complete use of male pronouns, ""bro,"" ""dude,"" etc. However, there's a problem. Caitlyn Jenner got brought up and they were saying a lot of triggering, transphobic comments about her (such as ""Bruce will always be a man, no matter how hard he tries"" and such). I just smiled and didn't say anything, obviously I wasn't about to out myself. I felt my face burning with nervousness as I tried to conceal my emotions. All I could think was ""WTF?""

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

People still have the mentality of a religious nutcase- Overly conservative. People here still think that homosexuality is a crime and women should get married at 21 and have kids at 23. Men are suppose to be ""alpha"", if not ,you have a huge chance of dying alone. We have a HUGE brain drain issue as well. In my hometown, I've witnessed the population getting older and older while the smart, Western-orientated individuals left the country to pursue a better life. You can work 18 hours per day and still get paid like shit. Infrastructure sucks balls. Healthcare sucks. At least folks is NA/Western Europe have the chance of self development. Here , just by opening the TV you can get suicidal, people are mean, the women are vapid, the ignorance and arrogance of some people is ridiculous. I can't wait to graduate so I can move the hell out of here. My family is VERY well off compared to other people here, but still, I'd rather live paycheck to paycheck in a developed country than have a nice job here. An aspect of Depression which IMHO is not talked about more often is that the country you were born and raised plays a huge role in your everyday wellbeing.

I'm planning to start writing a gay romance script and I was wondering what tropes have been overused and what cliches I should stay away at any cost?

Also, I've seen most of the biggest films in this genre (Call me by your name, handsome devil, Weekend, love, Simon, the way he looks, God's own country, hidden away), but I'd like to check out more of the genre. What films do you recommend?

And my last question regards the second genre. What other genre should I combine this gay romance script with, drama, comedy or something else?

Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvorlh,2-Channel Switching,"Hey there!

A few days ago I asked about electronic vs mechanical switching. Now I want to follow through on that, but I'm still new to this and hit a wall. So maybe someone can help me devise a solution or point me in the right direction.

* The problem: A 2-channel guitar/bass preamp, running on +/-15V.
* Two switches: 
   * Sw1 changes between channel A and B.
   * Sw2 engages both channels at the same time.
   * Sw1 can also be used to disengage both channels and switch to whatever channel wasn't active when Sw2 was pressed.
* Additional(?) challenge: Using soft touch momentary switches.

How do I go about this? My first try was with logic gates, but I can't figure out a solution using just gates. 

My second thought revolved around a flip-flop for Sw2, which gets reset every time Sw1 is pressed. Is that feasible? What components should I use?

Another route could utilize a µC, but in this area I'm even more in the dark about the what and how.

Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

Can someone convince me otherwise because this has never clicked to me.",transgender,changemyview,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/
cvisx4,Learning to use ‘woman/women’,"Amongst the many things hindering my self acceptance of my sexuality/feeling brave enough to share with those close to me is the distinct lack of the use woman/women in my vocabulary. I am 24 and can’t honestly say I use either of those words that often. When I talk about some female I’m interested in I generally say girl. When I talk about a group of females I say ladies. Even my use of ‘female’ right now ties into my poignant use of it in everyday life outside my academic/professional biological speak. This definitely falls into a category of patriarchal influence, but it truly has impacted my ability to accept myself. Me attributing the word girl to myself even as an adult woman makes a continuous mental cycle of ‘this is just a childish phase’ that I’m interested in another ‘girl’. This all is compounded with the fact that I am bi and have no problem using ‘man’ to describe a male I’m interested in. These words matter as the people I love matter and are not a phase. I matter and am not just a phase. 

I am a woman. I like women.",,actuallesbians,https://reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/cvisx4/learning_to_use_womanwomen/

He has had bottom and top surgery. He is also covered in tattoos, and his scars are very hard to see (I saw him shirtless at a graduation pool party a couple years ago).

cvp44t,Having a trans partner has brought to light a lot of sexuality issues...,"*Trigger warning, mentions of rape!* 

I've been having a lot of sexuality issues coming to the surface since I (cis F) started dating my guy (FtM). Before this, I was single for a while, so I didn't really think about sexuality that much- I settled on being somewhere on the queer spectrum. I'd like who I like, guys, girls, didn't matter and that would be it. It was easy to just say that I'm bi. But now, I'm still confused.

Now, I've been really anxious and confused about what exactly I am and where I fit- I don't know where to find a community which I can relate to. Honestly not sure if this is the right space for this, but I guess I can't be the only one who has had this kind of introspection because of being with a trans partner? 

Am I still bi? The labels vary- like how are we, partners of trans people supposed to understand the difference between bisexual and pansexuals? Am I weird? 

Another crisis- I love how masculine my partner is- but I am not that turned on by the thought of a penis or a strap on. I panic and get anxious when he brings up having sex after he gets bottom surgery, or whenever he wants a strap on. Sometimes I feel like a freak or selfish because I have moments when I'd wish he wouldn't get bottom surgery. I feel so guilty that I actually like what he's got going on down there right now. I feel like a shitty partner because I am turned on by his pre-transition junk, but the idea of post-bottom surgery junk scares me, or makes me anxious. I support him getting bottom surgery! It's still a bit far off, but I fully support him and I am excited to be by his side with the changes- it's just... yeah. 

I was raped in a previous relationship by a cis guy, which might explain the loads of anxiety or fear I've got regarding this- but I've always been more turned on by female genitalia than guy genitalia? Even when they're attached to a guy? Am I making any sense? Am I an asshole for this? 

I mean, I love him and sex with him is (and will be) great just because it's with him regardless of whatever is down there. It's just... odd? Because I do get turned on by his excitement for sex after op, and *him* but not turned on by the thought of the penis itself? 

Sometimes, I also worry about internalized transphobia because I can't seem to be attracted to transwomen. I guess for some background on this, it's not like \*when I find out they're trans\*, it's before/after this point. I feel like a douchebag for it, but I don't seem to have any problem with getting attracted to trans guys... Is that even allowed? 

I've been in this relationship for a while, and a lot of these thoughts have been simmering in my head for ages. Sorry, I kind of sound like a mess.",transphobia,mypartneristrans,https://reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/cvp44t/having_a_trans_partner_has_brought_to_light_a_lot/

cvbcyy,I genuinely think the right is going to have a millennial resurgence because of the ridiculousness of the radleft,"So something I’ve noticed lately is more and more people I personally know are going right. Even people who I otherwise always considered fundamentally progressive. 

I honestly think this is because of the media, and the lefts desire to eat their own. 

Look at the digital starlings of the right: Ben Shapiro, Crowder, and Peterson... these are, to normal people, mostly what I’d consider reasonable people. I wouldn’t consider them people who act in bad faith, nor very intellectually dishonest. Are they at times? Sure, but not really egregious, like say, Hannity or Limbaugh. These three people have a huge following of young people consuming their media, ideas, and thoughts... while I don’t agree with them on a ton of thing, at least they are reasonable. It’s not like on the left where shit is so ridiculous that you intellectually have to cough every time they speak. 

Who does the left really have that’s reasonable? I don’t think there are any real “stars” of the left. I can think of people like Sam Harris, who’s only partially political, but the radleft still tries to paint him as an alt right sympathizer at best. Joe Rogan? Same... left, but not too political. But also under constant attack for not being tribal enough. 

The left doesn’t really have any intellectually respectable figures who can spread the message. There is Jimmy, but he’s still relatively small compared to the conservative figures, and again, under attack by his own camp. That cutie pie who used to be on RT? She too has the same fate as Jimmy. 

I’m seriously concerned because more and more people are listening to right wing media. And I think it’s mostly due to the fact that the narrative leaders on the left are spewing intellectually dishonest shit not stop. To normal people, when they see places like the politics sub, they get turned away fast and hard. It’s too crazy, insane, and just outright deceptive. People aren’t dumb, and they can see right through the bullshit. 

This has effectively forced out liberal personalities from creating a voice for these ideas. It’s being drowned out by the radleft and their insane messages that focus on attacking white men all day long.

csapnw,Lists of studies and resources?,"So my girlfriend (who is also trans) has come out to her parents and they aren't accepting of her. She's hoping to have a conversation soon with them and ask them to allow her to use their insurance to help with transition and I thought it might help to have some studies or resources to help try to show her parents that transitioning will help her and is the best option. Unfortunately, her mom seems like she's biased towards believing transphobic talking points, and a few of the sources I have seem to have really low sample sizes or seem to have some transphobe coming up with half decent arguments against them that aren't easily debunked.

That all leads me to my question. Does anyone have any great sources or resources I can provide to her, or some sources for debunking major transphobic or TERF talking points? It would really help to have more info to provide her, since her parents might be persuaded. Also, if anyone else has any other ideas that might help her, those would probably help too. Thanks!

Edit: It would help to have less strictly medical sources and more sources debunking transphobic arguments and data showing that transition helps.

cvu186,Has your partner's transition affected your sexuality?,"People tend to ask me how I knew I was into boys  and thinking back on it I never knew I was into guys or even thought of it before the person I was dating came out as a trans guy.

At first I was a little taken back because it was big news, but I stayed with him because I still loved him. At first I was just thinking that I fell in love with him not his body, but over time that changed. Gradually I started loving how hot he looked with stubble in the morning, his muscles bulging when he lifted something heavy, and his hairy chest that I could fall asleep on. 

It wasn't just him though, as time progressed while we were dating I started seeing other guys as a lot sexier too. Even after we broke up I'm still turned on by guys. This was in high school, so it's very possible that I was always bi, but I just never noticed. 

Recently this story has been bothering me, because sometimes I feel like my attraction to women or men is fake. I'm a trans girl now, but do I still like girls because I was encouraged to by society growing up? Do I like guys because I dated a guy or to fit in with the trans girl stereotype? I mean I know these thoughts are dumb, but I just can't shake this guilty feeling of ""not really being straight or gay"".",trans girl,mypartneristrans,https://reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/cvu186/has_your_partners_transition_affected_your/

cvs58h,How can I help my child?,"I monitor my child’s (10 year old born female) internet usage to make sure she’s safe.  Over the last month, I’ve noticed searches for girl trapped in a boys body, transgendered boy and other similar titles. 

She has said things like I wish I was a boy (usually when there’s uncomfortable clothes while shopping or the men’s restroom line moves faster), and honestly I get it.

Parenting is hard, and to be honest, I don’t know what my next step should be. 

Should i ask questions? I realize it could be curiosity or that she could feel like she is a boy trapped in a girls body.  She is starting puberty and her body is starting to change accordingly. I know it’s an uncomfortable feeling and can’t imagine how it would feel if your body is changing in a more feminine way if that’s not the way you see yourself.

How do I let her know that it’s okay and that I will love her no matter what?  How do I let her know that I will always be there for her?  How can I help her? Or do I not do any of this and just have a discussion about different gender identities. Is she too young for us to talk about this? What is one thing you wish your parents would have done to help?

I apologize if I have said anything inappropriate.  I’m here to learn, so please correct me If needed.  Thank you so much for your help.",transgender,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cvs58h/how_can_i_help_my_child/
cvsyr8,I love h... whatever,"Hi my friends,
I'm a bisexual, cis, french women, almost thirty. (so, sorry for my bad english and my ""nothing-is-neutral-language"", French sexualises everything.)
I am in a relationship with an assigned boy for seven years now. 

Our wedding is scheduled for next year, and it has just experienced a real challenge.  To know that he has always (to my knowledge) spoken of himself in feminine during certain periods (what was attributed to his dyslexia, nvm)
and that now, after long research and long questioning, he is assuming genderfluid privately.

I do my best to support him, I love him whatever he is, but as you can read, using the right pronouns is complicated (we do not have ""it"" or ""they"" anything official or elegant in French, he himself also resigns)
At the same time, I am also very cowardly and I am afraid of the reaction of our families if it were to be fluid in public.

So it was also to share my love and my fears that I sent this message.  I hope you all can find people who will love you like I live him and who will be less coward than me.  In any case, it is out of the question for me to leave it.  Now it's my turn to work on it.
I'm just so scared that the world is cruel with my love.",,genderfluid,https://reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/cvsyr8/i_love_h_whatever/

cvnxam,[The 69th Hour] Going to jail for a few months. Looking for book suggestions and Pen Pals.,"So if you wanna hear more about my criminal life check my post history, I've done big AMA's and lots of write ups. I've actually been working on a book that I'll probably link if someone wants to read it. You can check out the best stories in my post history though. I'd like to put in some REAL work on my book while incarcerated but hand-writing with a shitty pen while surrounded by screaming black dudes just SUCKS DICK compared to typing.  


I'm going in for a dirty urine while on probation (fentanyl) while I'm also facing a DUI from 7+ months ago (also fentany). I've been struggling with opiate addiction for over ten years. I work doing CNC manufacturing while I'm going to school as well. I was very close to an associates in computer programming but I'm changing my major to something business based while also going to school for certificates in CAD/CAM drafting. This is due to my felony record, I just want to be realistic and at least I'd still be working with computers and my mind. I was supposed to start the semester today but alas, plans changed.   


I've only ever been in trouble for drugs, never anything with a victim.   


I spend my time reading, writing, and working out in jail. If anyone digs pen pals and writing letters (I fucking love it) I'd love to start a correspondence. Also jail is fucking infinitely funny and I would really like to write some short stories about what happens in there and mail them out, have someone type them up and post them on the sub. I swear the shenanigans that goes on in a low level facility is ridiculous, but it's so ubiquitous and common that I never remember it after it happened (because literally all day if filled with unbelievably dumb quotes and stories).  


I reckon I'll be going in sometime this week, I won't just be swooped up so I'll have time to post my address. I don't think it would really matter but I don't think I'll post it early. If you want to write me and don't mind me having your address you can PM me it first, if not just send a short letter to my posted address and I'll mail you back some great stories. I'm also not the type of dude to ever ask for money, my family always helps me out plus I run a store in jail (ie: loansharking).   


So here's the books I ordered from Amazon last night for my stay.  


[The Franklin Cover-up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0963215809/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  \- Love Conspiracy shit, but it's a pretty shit genre book wise. Most everything is on the internet as opposed to print.  


[The Monster of Florence     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455573825/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \- Love true crime  


[A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the Internet Tells Us About Sexual Relationships     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452297877/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \- Heard about it on the pod  
   
   [Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679728759/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \- I actually dig ""classic"" type books as long as their written past say... 1940/50. Although steinbeck rules and is super readable for being old. I like vonnegut too but I've never taken lit classes so sometimes I get stuck with avant garde artsy type books that actually aren't good. For the record I LOVED Infinite Jest and all of DFW's body of work.   
  
   [Snow Crash     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) \- Heard the audiobook a few times, shit's dope.  


[The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767900316/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)   


[I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586422383/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  


[Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires     ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250101700/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)   


And obviously, Overlook is in the shopping cart right now. I thought I had already ordered it, I actually planned on reading it as my first fiction read. These are my favorite books I've read: Hyperion, Dark Tower, The Stand, Infinite Jest, A Scanner Darkly, Homicide By David Simon, East of Eden, Dune, clockwork orange. I have Wheel of Time and 1984 tattoos as well (lol). Love those Huraki Murakami books too.   


If from all of these books you can recommend me some stuff I'd really appreciate it because it's really hard to think of ""new"" books to read without the internet when you're locked up. Often I end up checking out the authors other books in the dust jacket then ordering all of those.   


I'd like to read a history book too, I'm thinking about the Rev or Civil War. I tried reading A Peoples History of The United States but I found it a little to academic and dry. That's the type of thing I'd listen to on audiobook. So for the history book I'd appreciate readability over detail. I'm open to WW2 and Vietnam though.   


I'd like to learn as well, I'd appreciate any interesting sociology or psychology books. I'm probably gonna order Guns, Germs, And Steel as well. I'd also like to read some stuff about engineering and stuff I can actually maybe eventually apply to my college classes. You can't have a calculator so math books are basically useless. If anyone can recommend topics that can be learned simply from books (that aren't based around the liberal arts) it would be appreciated. Also any books on the topic of writing. Maybe I should check out J Peterson? I could use some self help, lol.",,MSsEcReTPoDcAsT,https://reddit.com/r/MSsEcReTPoDcAsT/comments/cvnxam/the_69th_hour_going_to_jail_for_a_few_months/

cvh179,"Was just dumped by a dom for not being ""subby"" enough... so what am I?","I really would appreciate some guidance as I'm a very new newbie and even reading stuff online sometimes doesn't really make sense to me.

I met a Dom on Fetlife and had my label listed as ""sub"" because I didn't know better. He and I kind of discussed back and forth about our interests and fantasies and he said he really thinks I'm actually a brat. I researched about it and yep, that was exactly what I was! So we met up, did some light play, and in the end, he seemed sort of detached and a little annoyed. I asked him what was wrong and he said that he just felt like I was too new to the BDSM thing. I said that I would get better with practice. The next weekend, we played again, and again he said I wasn't ""subby"" enough for him. I told him that a brat isn't supposed to submit automatically... isn't that the point of being a brat? He then said that me even talking back to him that way means I'm not ready for any of this at all. After another week of texting, he finally just ""dumped"" me today saying I'm just not submissive enough.

I felt really hurt and kind of humiliated in a way. I just don't know what I did wrong or what I was supposed to do. I'm still kind of sad about what happened... but I guess I just need more information so I came here to explain what kind of personality I have, and see what I would truly be labeled as.

I tend towards spanking/domestic discipline stuff. I like to push back, challenge authority, ""talk back"" as he said, be almost rude and annoying - but basically all in the hopes to be punished physically in some way, whether slapped, spanked, grabbed, or set up a real discipline session with all the works. Even during the punishment, I will have the tendency to curse, yell, fight back, but obviously if it's hurting too bad, I'm going to submit so he stops. I like pushing my boundaries and being threatened, but that doesn't mean I don't respect my Dom... I'm just playing around in hopes he'll lose his temper. After I'm punished, I will definitely be nicer and cuddle with him and submit to whatever he wants.

Is this just stuff that doesn't work in real life? Do dom's just dislike this kind of personality? What am I doing wrong?

&#x200B;

Edited to say: I'm not like this 24/7! Just at certain rules or maybe it felt fun in that moment or something... I'm definitely a rule follower/nice person in most aspects of my life.

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

Have you ever felt like that too and how did you get out of it?,"I've had trouble with myself for a while now with not really having a reason or desire to wake up and go ouside. For a while I didnt know what was wrong with me until I started looking into the modern day male identity crisis. It had a lot to do with young men feeling lost and despressed. They have problems finding close friends, trouble dealing and connecting with woman, dont have any long term goals to give them purpose and fill the void with video games.

cti61o,I could use some advice?,"I don't know what to do or what I'm doing. I guess I'll start with context and try to condense it. Im 23 and dependent on my parents.
                                                                                                                                                                 
 About 3 years ago I started to question my gender and a lot of things started to make sense. I somehow convinced my parents to take me to a therapist that worked with trans folk without telling them anything trans. A few sessions later and my therapist agreed that I'm trans and that I need to work on building a support system and my depression. So it was time to come out, which is very hard for me. On one of the drives home it was just me and my mom and I came out to her. She did not take it well at all and long story short, forced me back into the closet and stopped taking me to that therapist. I've been to other therapists and psychs but I've stayed closeted.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 I'm still depressed. I spend most my time sleeping with 0 motivation. The time I am awake I spend chasing escapism through either games or movies. I don't have any irl friends, just internet ones that I've known for a long time but I'm not out to. I live in the middle of nowhere and I don't drive. I know I'd need to move out to transition but I have no idea where to go or how to survive. As stupid as it is I'm comfortable here and it's a big risk to leave. Here I have a room, bed, food, internet connection, and a computer. While I'm not happy, I can escape my problems. 
 
 I know that I'm an adult and can move out but I don't where to go or how to get there or even where to start. It's all too much. I'd need to find a job to support myself but I got no work experience or even experience in finding a job. Add onto that that'll lose my medical insurance if I move out and I don't know how I'll transition. I don't know, I don't know how to be an independent adult and I don't know what to do. I just feel trapped, scared and alone. 
 
 I don't know what I'm expecting from this post. Someone to swoop in and save me? That's unrealistic and asking too much. Besides it won't help me become independent. Maybe advice or a place to start. Or maybe I'm just venting. I just don't know",,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cti61o/i_could_use_some_advice/

cvtnp4,The police cannot chase ATV’s or dirt bikes,"Please don’t come up to the police screaming at the top of your lungs “Why are you just standing there! Go stop them!” I cannot. MPD policy forbids us from chasing them for obvious and good reason. With that said we try to get them on our body camera and their face so we ID them later and do a warrant. But most cover their faces so there’s really nothing that can be done. But throw down spike strips! Two problems with that. One, we have no idea where they’re going to go. They could simply drive onto the sidewalk to avoid it or flip a u-turn. Two, the MPD does not have spike strips and their use is forbidden by policy. We simply stand there and watch and that’s about all we can do.

For a while, I had assumed the trender ideologies were just a bunch of fringe, nutty, half-baked ideas that would only be taken seriously by edgy 14 year olds on Tumblr.  Now I'm starting to wonder.    


At work, we have to do training videos each year on diversity and things like that.  They're specifically protecting trans people, but that included nonbinary genders and they/them genders, stating that dysphoria isn't necessarily required to be trans .  I went to pride and there was actually someone taking names, trying to get people to sign a petition to eliminate the term ""gender dysphoria"" because it excludes people who don't experience dysphoria.  When I started hormones, I had to see a therapist for at least 3 months and get a letter to start hormones, but now you can start them without any doctor or therapist approval (which, I'll admit, is helpful when you're moving to a new city or switching doctors).  And, yeah, our local trans group does seem to include someone who is, well, a girl, she has never expressed any dysphoria or desire to be anything other than a woman, who has never presented as anything masculine in any way, but she says she's trans so, yay, she's part of the community.  And nobody seems to question her; I'll admit, I'm glad she's an ally and she's on our side for politics and everything, but, her experiences are nothing like mine and her experiences with transgenderism is nothing I can relate with at all.

cvqeh9,"I realized today that, if I had been born twenty years later, I'd certainly be on puberty blockers and hormones by now.","Clarification: I was born in 1993.

I was going through a box of childhood stuff today and I noticed a few drawings of mine where they were signed with the feminine version of my name. It took me a while to remember things clearly, but I managed to recall that my mother had raised me in her best attempt without gender roles, having been raised in a very liberal country herself. I wasn't encouraged to do sports (she uses the term ""forced""), I was given both girl's toys (Barbies) and boy's toys (Action men) to play with and any attempt to ""man me up"" from my father was met with criticism.

Result? I ended up having a phase where I wanted to be a girl. I tried to grow my hair (having a little man-bun with a pink crunchie hidden with a cap), I wanted to be referred to with the female version of my name and I essentially wanted to be like the girls in my class because I believed girls had it better than boys (wow, I wonder why I believed that). I went to a psychologist back then (idk why, I just remember I hated it) and she usually followed his very liberal advice, which ended up hurting me in some more personal aspects in the long run, because he was admittedly very progressive for the time.

I don't remember much more of that nowadays, but other than not being straight and not being into mainstream sports, I'm pretty much what you'd expect from a normal guy. I do archery, collect weapons, I swear like a sailor, I can stomach beer and I have zero desire of shaving my legs, wearing a wig and dress and start calling myself a woman.

Which is why I find myself becoming more worried the more I see the gender transitioning of kids normalized. This is where IDpol becomes a problematic thing. While I believe there are people who are genuinely born in the wrong body, who *need* this kind of treatment and whose lives would be greatly improved by transitioning, I do feel that by casualizing (normalizing doesn't feel like the correct term) something as changing your gender, and encouraging it to be identified and diagnosed on children, is a very dangerous thing that is happening to our society. However, I don't know how we can address that without sounding like we want to get rid of trans people.",,stupidpol,https://reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/cvqeh9/i_realized_today_that_if_i_had_been_born_twenty/

Should i ask questions? I realize it could be curiosity or that she could feel like she is a boy trapped in a girls body.  She is starting puberty and her body is starting to change accordingly.

How do I let her know that it’s okay and that I will love her no matter what?  How do I let her know that I will always be there for her?  How can I help her? Or do I not do any of this and just have a discussion about different gender identities. Is she too young for us to talk about this? What is one thing you wish your parents would have done to help?

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvuvob,Entitled Parent yells at me for Using the Bathroom,"So this story was a couple of months ago but it is still the craziest entitled parent moment I have ever had.

I was on my way to work and I was dressed in a black t-shirt, push up bra (relevant), jeans and sneakers. I should also mention that because my hair is short I am frequently mixed up with being a guy but I go to extra lengths to make it a little easier on people who don't notice boobs or a lack of Adam's apple. Usually, I wear makeup and make sure to always wear pushup bras and women's clothes so no one questions me.  
Anywho on my way to work, I really need to pee, like OUTSTANDINGLY SO. The kinda pee that consumes your every waking thought. So I stop at the shopping centre to use the bathroom, I walk into the female bathroom and I get a few funny looks (nothing unusual, I understand) but most people just do a quick double-take then mind their own damn business.  
Once I finish my quest I go to wash my hands and that when I meet Entitled Mum (EM) and her kid, a little boy about 5-6 years old.

EM: \*Ahem\*  
I glance at her briefly but just go back to washing my hands  
EM: Excuse me?  
Me: Yes?  
EM: You're in the wrong bathroom  
Me: Pardon sorry?  
EM: BATHROOM, you need to go to the other bathroom  
Me: With all due respect Ma'am, I'm a girl  
EM: I don't want my little boy growing up thinking that people can just use whatever bathroom they please, you need to leave.

Now usually I'm a very chill person, I'd just walk away and leave her to her little entitled life but that day I was in a good mood so I decided to give her a piece of my mind.

Me: Ma'am, I'm a girl, a woman at that, I have just as much a right to be in this bathroom as you do, furthermore I am washing my hands, getting ready to leave - just treat me with the respect of everyone else in this bathroom and leave me be.  
EM: I don't know what's wrong with you trannys but I just want to go to the bathroom without you flaunting yourself everywhere

Now I was TICKED

Me: Ma'am, I have treated you with nothing but respect, I have been understanding and considerate but all you have done is continued to berate me and use slurs that are extremely offensive. So I'm going to tell you for the last time, I'm a girl, born a girl, will die a girl, here is my student ID card from an all-girls school, my license which says that I'm a female. Furthermore, here is a picture of me as a baby, dressed in a pink frilly dress. If that isn't enough to prove it to you, you should just mind your own damn business.

And with that... I left. Even flipped her the bird on the way out.",,entitledparents,https://reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/cvuvob/entitled_parent_yells_at_me_for_using_the_bathroom/

cvvmha,My experience coming out as transgender to my church.,"So, I thought a while about posting this here. I know that my identity and existence is already something of a trouble for people even in the secular world. That I have come out as a transgender Christian and transitioned was something I never thought I would do. My journey has led me to such an amazing place though, one where I am closer to God than I have ever been in my life, one where I am closer to my church family than I ever thought I would be, and one that has humbled me and my misconceptions about Christianity.

I first knew I was transgender at 12 years old. In rural south Louisiana, there was not much I could do about it. I had conservative parents and lived in a deeply red area. The church services I would go to condemned people like me and spoke of LGBT people with the meanest language possible. It was dehumanizing and I quickly came of the perception that the church did not have a place for a person like me.

So at 13, I became an atheist much to my dad and mom's chagrin. I never transitioned and once I made it to 20 years old, I figured that being transgender would just be too difficult and I would try to grit through life as a man. I still lived in the deep south and the prospect of transitioning seemed scary to me. I still avoided churches.

It wasn't until 30 years old, freshly divorced, that I started attending church again. It was a PC(USA) Church that I decided to go to... humble little building, beautiful worship hymns and the kindest people I ever met. I didn't know their ideological slant and didn't care much - their true kindness showed to me at a time I felt very broken post divorce was enough for me. I did choose PC(USA) because I knew they were fairly tolerant of diversity - I had thought being trans was behind me, but I knew that I wanted to be part of a church that was open to others. That being said, this particular PC(USA) church didn't seem to take any stance on this stuff.

After talking to a therapist for many months, I determined that I was in fact still very much trans, and wanted to transition. I started hormones and hid things for 4 months, but the changes became harder and harder to hide. The thing that concerned me the most out of everything was my church, though - I had found such a loving place that cared for me and my son, and I feared that I would lose that church. I was mentally transported to a time and place where I was condemned from the pulpit and made to feel like I was inhuman and disgusting. 

I nearly didn't even give my new church a chance - I nearly left the church to transition.

But god I am so glad that I did not make that choice. Instead, I spoke to an elder of the church. She has a trans daughter, come to find out, who didn't feel comfortable going to the church for the same reason I didn't. But I told her that I wanted to, that everyone was so kind and nice and that I wanted to give it a chance. So we spoke to our pastor together.

Our pastor was accepting and kind to me, and said that he would gladly change my name in the register and that I of course was always welcome to worship, and that he'd do anything he could to make me feel comfortable and integrate me within the church body. 

A few days later, I came out on Facebook and let the word travel through the church. Numerous people on Facebook liked my status, and that next day, I was flooded with requests to sit beside them in church. Here is a sampling of them. The kindness and love still moves me to tears. Names are obviously removed:

https://i.imgur.com/UWV17K8.png

I went to church the next day and had more than enough people sitting around me as I presented myself as I am, dressing as I wanted to dress and going by my new name. I was actually mistaken for someone's daughter which gave me a bit of a giggle. 

Ever since that first day, I have gone to every service since. The women of the church gathered together and gave me clothes since replacing my wardrobe is so expensive - I must have gotten $1,000 worth of new clothing from the collective church body. Some of the more conservative members of the church have come up to me and thanked me and invited me for lunch to just speak with me. I'm open about everything with them, it's a journey we are going through together. The kids seem respectful and the parents are openly loving and accepting. 

All this to say... the church is a very scary place for many LGBT people. Transitioning in a church is not something I ever thought I would do. Receiving clothes from the church? Absolutely not something I ever expected to happen. But I am part of a church family that loves me for me, and that loves God and worships together with me at their side, not ashamed but happy to have me with them. I'm involved in my church's social media, I volunteer when I can, and I feel like I've found a home for my heart when for so long it felt homeless. Even in the face of my parents rejecting me for religious reasons, my church has become my truest family.

I hope that those of you with LGBT members in your church can do the same. It means the world to a person like me.

**TL;DR:** Left Christianity at 13 because I was secretly trans, joined back at 30, came out in church and transitioned, the church respected and loved me, gave me clothing, and I am closer than ever to God and my church family.",transgender,Christianity,https://reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/cvvmha/my_experience_coming_out_as_transgender_to_my/

cvqc48,I really don't like living as an unpassable trans woman,"I know I'm trans without a doubt and I've loved all the changes that transitioning has brought me, but... 

I'm pretty unpassable. My voice has gotten good, but in terms of looks I'm basically a man with boobs now. Even at my best angle there's highly clockable features, and from any other angle I get read as a man without question. At best someone clocks me as a trans woman, but people just read me as an effeminate guy. I hate it and I'm struggling to deal with it. 

I also have realllllly dark beard shadow that laser hasn't gotten rid of yet and it's such a pain. Shaving every day destroys and cuts up my face because of my sensitive skin, and even then I can't hide the beard shadow well. That includes using orange concealer to cancel out the beard shadow tones. It just doesn't hide it well. It also doesn't help that my face is always bumpy and cut up which makes it even more obvious sometimes. I can only hide my beard shadow well if I take a few days off from shaving to let my face heal, shave and then use makeup. That's unrealistic living as a full time woman. 

I wanted to transition because I thought that passing would be in the cards for me... but I don't think it is. 

I know there are a bunch of trans women living their lives without passing and they're okay with it, but personally I hate every fucking second of it. Most days I'm kinda consumed by anxiety and it's difficult to do anything I want to do. For the first time since starting my transition I've become more suicidal like I was pre-transition. I really don't like living like this. I wish I transitioned before puberty so I didn't have to deal with any of this nonsense",trans woman,asktransgender,https://reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/cvqc48/i_really_dont_like_living_as_an_unpassable_trans/

cvdgyl,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,"This is an issue I've seen come up more and more recently and it's never made sense to me. Looking at the definition of Transphobic  - Having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people. I don't see not wanting to date them fitting that at all.   
   
Not wanting to date transpeople does NOT :

1. Imply you don't think trans people deserve the right to exist.
2. Imply that you have a deep rooted hatred of Trans People that might mean you will incite violence to them.
3. Imply that you have an inherent issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

  
There is nothing wrong with having preferences. Some people like their partners to be a little on the chubby side. Some people prefer their partner to be the same race as them. Some people prefer their partners to have a certain EYE COLOR. Those are all fine things and they are all valid. It is just as valid to want to date someone who was born genetically as the gender they identify as.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to date a genetic female and there may be other reasons behind it that are not impure or transphobic. Say if he wants to have kids with his wife? Say they like the fact that genetic vaginas are self lubricating. Or if, in regards to pre op, say they neither enjoy Anal nor have a sexual interest in a partner with a penis. Those things do not make someone a bad person.

The same for women and genetic men. Trans Men can't even develop penises so if that's something a female is attracted to in a partner that's already out of the way. Not being attracted to them for not having a penis is no worse than them not being attracted to a genetic male who lost his penis in some type of accident. If that's something they want from their partner it does not make them a bad person.

To me this is no better than saying, because you won't date someone of the same sex, you're homophobic. Almost like they're saying you find something inherently wrong with it because you won't do it yourself. When that's far from the truth. You just have your own preferences which are as valid as anyone else as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

cvtsjj,"Am I Trans? (sorry if there are multiple posts, still getting the hang of this app)","Ok so I'm 27 and up until now I've identified as gay. But lately I'm not so sure. I guess I'd like to start off by asking if anyone who is gay can identify with this. As a kid, maybe as young as 9 or 10 I'd wanted to be a girl. I remember crying and praying about it a lot, hoping that if I prayed hard enough I would become one. Safe to say that never happpened. Earlier memories than that include me playing in my moms wigs, make up and heels, but I was a young kid then you know, so I dont put much thought into it. Has anyone gone through something similar? Fast forward to my teen years. I'm a big guy, even in hs I was about 6'1 220lbs. Back then I was pretty fem, not super fem, but a heck of a whole lot more so than now, I guess you could say I was in between. I am not that way anymore and I cant remember when that changed. Sure I'm comfortable being masc but I feel like I suppressed the fem in me at some point. Anyhow, I started identifying as a gay bottom and I thought I'd found myself, you know? But here's the thing, I'm super attracted to very masculine ""straight acting"" men. And only them. I'm not attracted to fem guys whatsoever and even the thought of a masculine verse guy taking dong up the butt is a massive deal breaker for me as it turns me off. Literally every guy I've ever crushed on has been straight and yes that has been quite infuriating. Im like what is it about you guys that keeps pulling me in. I bullshit you not, I'm that gay friend that goes to a gay bar and ends up liking the one straight guy that is there. It's like a friggin magnet. Sometimes its obvs they are straight and I never pursue them but then their are the ones where it's a coin toss you know, until you do more digging and find out. No one has been gay that I've crushed on in all my 27 years of living. Either bi curious or just experimental. So there is that. I also dont really like having my penis touched, which I've come to discover is a problem, because naturally other gay guys want to touch it. It makes me uncomfortable.  Another thing I'm really confused about is sex. As a bottom, I crave penetration. I dont know why. I just want to be penetrated, to the point it drives me nuts, but anal sex doesnt feel...""right"". It has been enjoyable but even then something about just didnt feel right, like it isnt enough. I hope that makes sense. Anyhow, I've been watching shows, youtube vids, and just listening to people and I wonder if I suppressed the thoughts of being Trans. Anyhow, I'm not sure of anything at this point. Just lots of confusion. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",,MtF,https://reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/cvtsjj/am_i_trans_sorry_if_there_are_multiple_posts/

cvrbcn,An interview with a detransitioner about going back to talk to her doctor,"  [https://medium.com/@mariacatt42/talking-about-talking-to-doctors-49778915ed4](https://medium.com/@mariacatt42/talking-about-talking-to-doctors-49778915ed4) 

**Talking About Talking to Doctors**

**Grace is a detransitioned woman in the Midwest who you can follow on Twitter @hormonehangover. She recently spoke to the doctor that prescribed her HRT and wrote the referral letter for her top surgery. She’s exceptional for doing so- in my circle only a handful of detransitioners have gone back to inform their doctors about their detransition. She agreed to speak with me about the decision to initiate the conversation and the consequences of the experience, with the hope it will help other detransitioners consider whether they’re up to have the talk.** 

**Why did it feel important to talk to the doctor who enabled your transition?**

It just felt like my duty. I know how much everything is a wild west right now with trans medicine, and I wanted her to know that there isn’t always a happy grateful trans man coming out the other side of that process. My doctor used to tell the press that no one she sees had ever regretted transition. Once we had a talk, at the very least, she would stop saying that to everyone.

Also, once she asked me to do a publicity interview to talk about how much her clinic had helped me. I did that interview really early on in my transition, and now I totally feel differently than I did then. I felt so guilty for acting as a spokesperson on her behalf. I had to set the record straight! 

**What was returning to that office like?**

It felt like a bizarro version of my first hormone appointment. All of the cheerful affirmative gender stuff around the clinic struck me as sinister now. There was a picture of a trans child from a weird online webcomic on the wall, and all this cheerful stuff about “Be You!” And there I was, the prodigal daughter returning with bad news. 

My body was hot and I felt really anxious when I went into the room. My old doctor greeted me warmly and breezily, and we went to a new - agey massage room to talk informally. For the first part of the conversation, I told her about how I had come to the decision to transition, and then why I had regretted it and detransitioned. She used a lot of language like “tell me your story, I want to honor it.”

I told her the gist of it: I started my physical transition at age 23, was very depressed, didn’t see any other way forward, got hormones, got surgery - and then I realized I was going nowhere and my fantasy of becoming a happy man was impossible.  I told her that I unequivocally regretted my surgery and hormones. I told her that the surgery had brought me pain, regret, and grief. I told her I wished I had known there were other ways to deal with gender dysphoria.

“It sounds like you needed someone to offer you something besides hormones and surgery. And I’m sorry that we didn’t provide that.” A beat. “But I don’t see that as my role.” 

**Ooof. It’s not her role to provide something besides hormones and surgery. I would’ve lost my shit. How did you not lose your shit?**

Ha. Well. It was very infuriating. Whose role is it, then? What the hell?

I was there on a mission, though, in  Friendly Detransitioner Ambassador mode. So I tried to play it cool so she wouldn’t get defensive.  I asked her, who is going to let people know about alternatives, if not doctors or therapists? If that’s something we need to figure out on our own, who does she think is going to be telling us about that? She didn’t really answer that.

As the conversation continued, she became closed off. Her body leaned away from me and she looked very uncomfortable.  I think she wasn’t expecting me to be so angry and hurt. 

I asked her if she followed WPATH Standards of Care.

“Of course.”

I brought up that in WPATH, they say you should be screened for “anxiety, depression, self-harm, a history of abuse and neglect, compulsivity, substance abuse, sexual concerns, personality disorders, eating disorders, psychotic disorders, and autistic spectrum disorders.” I mentioned that if I had been screened and treated for, for example, eating disorders, depression,  and possibly compulsivity, that would have helped me a lot to lessen my gender distress.

She replied ”​the Standards of Care is a guideline that was never meant to be hard and fast.”

When I asked her if she thought there was any way to tell in advance if someone could benefit from transition, she said that there probably wasn’t, and they just had to try it and see. She said she wanted to err on the side of putting up too few “hoops” to jump through than too many. To her, if someone said they were trans, she believed them, and that was all she needed. “And you come to me and tell me you’re not trans, and I believe you now, too,” she added.

On the subject of diagnosing people with gender dysphoria/being trans, she said that she “decided early on that it \[Gender Dysphoria\]  wasn’t a diagnosis she could make. Like I can’t determine whether someone doesn’t identify with the body that they were given.”

That stunned me. I asked her, so, who diagnosed me with gender dysphoria? She admitted that she did, in fact, write me the diagnosis. I have the paperwork.

So that was strange. It seemed really bizarre that she would say verbatim that she couldn’t diagnose gender dysphoria but that she did it anyway. I wondered to myself: what would a lawyer think of this? I mean, I certainly misdiagnosed myself as someone who would benefit from transition. I won’t deny that. But she’s the doctor. Are patients expected to be able to diagnose themselves accurately for, say, schizophrenia or breast cancer, and receive treatment with no questions asked?

She had a couple of tips for me. One was that most people, unlike me, had seriously thought about it before coming in to get their hormones. The other one was that I had moved too fast getting surgery, much faster than most people. She also told me that she wanted me to know that my story is valid, and that this just shows how much bigger the spectrum of human gender is. These were not especially comforting or useful things for me to hear at that juncture.

**So she’s telling you your story is valid but she’s also stating other people thought harder, with the implication being your failure to think hard led to this negative outcome.  I see this response to detransitioner stories a lot online, but hearing it straight out of the mouth of  a doctor who is beholden to an ethics board must have been surreal. How did you respond?**

I didn’t know how to respond to that. It felt almost insulting to be told that post-transition. How does she know other people thought about it more? And, how does she know I didn’t think about it? I was nonbinary-idenified for like 3 years prior, and I obsessed over my body for ages.  Like, if people moving too fast is a concern, why didn’t she tell me that during the process of transition, instead of writing my damn surgery letter 4 months in? 

Also, I think it’s possible to think about something for a long time without being able to “think your way out,” if that makes sense. Sometimes spending a lot of time thinking about something just means you are going in circles obsessively and talking yourself into something. 

It was a weird contrast to how it had been to be assessed and treated for ADHD. I had also gone to a doctor specifically because I thought I might have ADHD, just like I did with gender dysphoria, but in that case, they had a robust battery of tests that they did. When that was done, I had to wait until I had my eating disorder into remission until I got given any medication. 

By contrast, my doctor asked me basically one question-

Her: Why do you want to transition? 

Me: Being a woman isn’t working for me anymore.

\-and then gave me an informed consent form to sign, and that was it. She diagnosed me with gender dysphoria based on my uninformed opinion. She also wrote me a letter for my double mastectomy five month in. No questions asked.

**Backing up so we can get context, what was happening in your life when you pursued transition?**

I had identified as nonbinary since I was 19, but had never thought of myself as a candidate for physical transition or known anyone who physically transitioned.  That all changed when I dated a nonbinary person who told me they wanted top surgery, and it felt like an “aha” moment. I realized I had this idea of trans men that was this super masculine person, but this person was just like me - a kind of awkward, androgynous, sweet female person. I suddenly realized that transition was a possibility for little old me, and that was exhilarating. The idea of a mastectomy really appealed to me in particular, and of passing as a man.

When I was 22, I moved back in with my parents and started isolating myself and obsessing over trans men on the internet. I binged on trans reddits and followed tons of trans men on instagram. It was kind of like a religious epiphany crashing over me. It was like, “Wow, this is it.” I felt like I had unlocked the true secret of why I seemed to feel so miserable and uncomfortable and weird all the time. 

I made the decision to transition at a time when a lot of different rough stuff was converging in my life. In no particular order: I had just gotten out of a relationship with a scary alcoholic guy.  I was out of college and unemployed and had no idea what to do with my cool Gender Studies degree. Being out of the structure of school for the first time in my life was really hard for me. I had just been diagnosed with adult ADHD, and was adrift, miserably bad at structuring my time on my own. I also had been struggling with low-grade eating disorders for years and was completely checked out from my body. I had some traumatic sexual experiences that made me feel disgusted about my body. 

Also, for the first time, there were these scary suicidal thoughts popping into my head. In retrospect, it would have been a great time to chill out and focus on my mental health  and put off permanent surgical decisions. But alas, I am an impulsive person, and instead, I became obsessed with transition as the thing that would save me.

Trump had just been elected, which filled me with fear. I was in a hyper-liberal bubble. There was a lot of talk  amongst my trans friends of him shutting down the ability of people to get healthcare. I was totally caught up in it. I thought there was going to be a big shutdown of the ability to transition, and I thought that that would mean I would succumb to despair without it. My friends and family were all supportive of me transitioning. They wanted me to be happy and they had been educated enough on trans activism to know that questioning me would be considered “very transphobic”. 

So I went down to the doctor and got on hormones a bit before my 23rd birthday, in April of 2017. I was excited and terrified. The day I got T I was insanely happy. I cried with joy. It was very touching. 5 months later, I got top surgery, which was so grotesque and that it gave me major pause. That was the beginning of the end of my manic, ill-thought-out transition.

**Were you seeing a therapist before transitioning? What were they like?**

I found a therapist by seeing who was covered by my insurance, and then calling her. The qualifications she gave was that she had worked with several trans men in the past, which was good enough for me. We only had a couple appointments before I started HRT. The therapist experience was pretty mediocre. She was an ultra-affirmative lady who didn’t know very much about trans people. She didn’t challenge me much, and she recommended to me that if I was questioning my gender, I should go out and buy a binder and try it out. I had been holding out on doing that, but I did it on her suggestion. That turned out to have been the worst possible advice she could have given me, because binding fucks up your body and makes it hard to breath. It also made my disconnection from my breasts worse and worse. After a few months of binding, I really wanted top surgery so I could stop binding. 

**It seems pretty normal for people’s dysphoria to spike when they start binding, which makes some intuitive sense.  You’re avoiding a body part, of course that would increase your distress when you are forced to be aware of the body part.  My therapist gave me some similar terrible advice, that I should take testosterone because if I liked taking it that would mean transition was right for me. It’s so interesting how therapists who will never partake in these body modifications have this magical thinking about how they can be used for self-discovery, while they ignore the physical risks.  How could a therapist have been helpful to you rather than simply cheering on body modification?**

I would have liked to have a therapist who was really informed on transgender culture, but also had critical thinking skills and was willing to help me slow down and really explore my distress. I think that’s what everyone with dysphoria deserves, but very few people get.  

I honestly think it would be good for her to have suggested that I get off the internet. I was basically marinating myself in trans stuff. There was a lot of other things I should have been focusing on to make myself feel better. I think I needed to probe in and learn more about what was going on, what it meant to have gender dysphoria, and maybe break out of the mindset that transition was something I had to do.

I wish I’d had a therapist who was familiar with the possibility of detransition, so she could have seen the red flags. At the same time, the sort of attitude that I had was a “us vs them” attitude. I had learned that therapists who “gatekeep” are the enemy. I would have needed a therapist to make a connection with me and help me stop rushing. Someone who could reassure me that it was bad to make decisions in a rush. 

Then it would have been good to do some sort of actual structured assessment that could distinguish between gender dysphoria and other conditions. I would have liked someone to help me stop obsessing over suicide fears and body feelings and try to expand my horizons. Like, there are so many things that I should have done before transitioning. I should have gotten a new job, applied to grad school maybe, started exercising, gotten off the internet, made some friends -- any of that stuff. It’s pretty basic stuff, but it would have helped me. Of course, it wouldn’t have been easy for a therapist to get through to me. I was pretty stubborn. But I did have all these secret fears and doubts I was struggling with. I think I could have been talked down if I had better information about how shitty transition and major surgery and all that are.

**It strikes me that so much of detransition is about being willing to look directly at some dark truths about the world. I think I’ve never gone back to talk to my doctor or therapist in large part because I’m scared of exactly the responses you got. Was it challenging to emotionally process how the conversation went down?**

When I got out of the office, I kept repeating, oh my god, oh my god. I was just a lab rat. She never knew what she was doing at all. I felt a little vindicated on one hand - I wasn’t the only one acting irrationally. I realized my doctor had been acting very unprofessionally. I saw that in retrospect, all of my professionals had done nothing to offer me any other options. I had a strange sense of understanding for my former self. At the time, I thought gender dysphoria was only treatable by hormones and surgery. It had felt like I had no options. Absolutely all of the information available to me from *professionals* told me that story. 

A larger sense of dread enveloped me when I thought more about it. I felt so stupid for falling for a charletan like her, but I also felt outraged. She was supposed to be a doctor. She’s the one who went to med school. She was supposed to be prescribing medicine. And she had admitted that she had no way of diagnosing gender dysphoria. It felt so wrong. 

How many other people would suffer like I had? I knew she was treating minors and prescribing puberty blockers. 

When I told her there would be more people like me, she had said “Of course.” Of course? Of course? Well, what’s the plan for people like me? It seemed like she took no responsibility for her part in the system. 

If you’re thinking of doing this, I would say: be prepared for it to be an emotional experience. Our doctors need to know, but they might not be ready to hear it.  I went back to the woman who had enabled me to hurt myself massively and opened up to her in the hopes that she would learn from me. I hoped she might have some advice for me, somewhere for me to turn. But all she did was say I was “valid.” Thanks a lot!  It’s rough to open up to someone and be met with milquetoast platitudes.

**Have you considered legal action against your doctor?** 

I thought about suing my doctor after the conversation. It was so clear to me that she was not following WPATH or indeed any sort of rigorous medical standards. 

Pros of pursuing legal action:

To push back against the current way things are done. Doctors might be more careful in handing out hormones if they knew that there was a potential for patients to hold them accountable if things go wrong. The current situation is that if you detransition, doctors have almost no resources available to help them deal with the treatments that they prescribed you. I’d like to see some more accountability come back into the scene. I think there’s a huge wave of detransitioners coming, and I know that it’s terrible to go through. 

I worry a lot about the kids who are getting surgery and hormones before they can even understand what they are signing up for. Thinking of a 14 or 15  year old going through that is mind-boggling.  I know a lot of detransitioners who are suffering but don’t have the desire to sue. I think as long as we are silent and don’t make too much trouble, providers will try to ignore us as an inconvenient side effect of something good they are doing. And that’s not fair to us! 

Cons of pursuing legal action:

 It would be harrowing, and ugly, and drawn-out. A lot of what has helped me deal with detransition trauma is honestly distracting myself from my wounds and trying new things. If I was engaged in a court battle, I would have to face that all the time. I would be open to scrutiny and cross-examination by lawyers, and I would have to hold my head up through that. This would be months, and probably years, of staring my trauma in the face and opening myself up to scrutiny. After having this confrontation with my doctor, I think the mental health effects would be intense. I think doctors usually have good lawyers, so I’d need to have access to a really good lawyer as well. It would be really expensive, and a lot of detransitioners seem, anecdotally, to be pretty broke. I am not rich. I’m also trying to move on and rebuild my life. 

**Moving on and rebuilding a life is a huge project. What does detransition self-care look like for you?**

For my detransition, I went through a couple of phases. When I first realized I regretted my top surgery, I went off hormones and started hysterically crying every single night. I felt completely mutilated and disgusting. The scars on my chest would ooze and bleed, and I felt like a walking corpse. I viscerally missed my old body. It was like missing someone who died, or being homesick as a scared little kid. I was sure my life was ruined. I wanted to give up. 

This lasted for a few months. I’d like to give a big shoutout to my boyfriend for listening to me blubber about the same variation of “oh my fucking god this feels so wrong how can I live with this” every night for that period of time. 

Then I decided to knit a giant blanket and wait until I finished it to see if I felt better. I basically felt terrible for that entire time, but every time I felt like I needed to give up, I told myself I would feel better when the blanket was done. That project took me 6 months to finish knitting, and when it was done, I did feel a little better. Not great, but out of the worst part of my depression.

I don’t feel at all healed from my surgery and hormones, but I feel more at peace than I used to. If I focus on the horror of what I did to myself, it makes me want to scream! So a big coping mechanism for me has been distracting myself with crafting and video games and exercising. I paired that with EMDR therapy, with a new therapist, so I could do all my scream-crying with a soothing professional and give my friends a break. 

I try to be very patient with myself and give myself time. I read something that said it’s normal to take at least two years to start feeling better after a big upheaval in your life. I still feel a lot of regret and sadness and physical pain every day, but I know I can survive now.

**What do you hope to see the detransitioner movement create? Are there priorities you feel it’s especially important for us to focus on?**

We need to get organized and get some tangible resources for each other. I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s good getting the word out on twitter and such. I really want there to be a nonprofit organization for detransitioners by detransitioners.

I’d love to have an official online presence for a detrans org in addition to the huge, wonderful web of twitter and tumblr accounts that are cropping up right now.  For those of us who have been through some HRT or surgeries, I think we need to get insurance to cover reconstruction and electrolysis and HRT for people who lost the ability to make hormones. I’d like there to be more awareness of other treatments for dysphoria, so that dysphoric people can possibly avoid the pain and expense of useless surgeries and hormones. Maybe we could also find good lawyers and therapists to help point people towards. There’s so much to do, it’s so overwhelming! But it’s such a crucial point right now, we could make a big difference.",trans man,detrans,https://reddit.com/r/detrans/comments/cvrbcn/an_interview_with_a_detransitioner_about_going/

But overall I'm heavily masc.

So I'm in a few facebook groups and I was on r/ftm for a while and I always see these 'oh I still love wearing makeup and skirts am I still valid???' posts. If that's what they like it's whatever but it always makes me dysphoric even thinking of 1: ever having to wear makeup again and 2: the possibility that an outsider might see post like these and use it against trans men (see TERFS thinking that trans men are just 'confused lesbians')

Today I was having a pretty good day. While I don't really know if I was passing I was doing a good enough job for people to not misgender me in my polite and casual interactions.   


I had an appointment with my psychologist today. She works out of a large office complex that houses many different people with a variety of vocations. They are all managed by a single receptionist.   


Now, this receptionist is very conservative. I know this, because all day every day she has conservative am talk radio blaring while she does her job. This is the first time I came to visit my psychologist presenting female. The receptionist whom I've interacted with several times at first did not recognize me, but once she did she went ice cold and stared daggers at me. She also, of course insisted on using the wrong pronouncs and deadnaming me while talking to and about me both as I was coming and going from my appointment.  


I guess my issue is... how should I feel? It's sort of strange that it hurts me more when strangers accidentally misgender me rather than doing it maliciously. Is this wrong hearted? I'm feeling kind of confused. Any good takes?

It seems really homophobic to me to say that lesbians must love penis, and almost like a form of conversion therapy.  I have heard many times about how lesbians just need a good dick to realise they love men. It is pure homophobia and refusal to accept that some females just don't want male genitalia in their sex life.

cvka7k,What feminine things did you like growing up?,"It was a real challenge to me, coming to terms with my trans identity, to look back on my childhood and see that, yeah, I liked Barbies, particularly for the miniature furniture and cooking sets. I liked gemstones and shiny rocks and intricately-carved metal jewelry things. I never really /wore/ jewelry much, didn't get my ears pierced till I was 22, but I sure liked lookin at em! (This turned into a fascination with hand-made knives, hilariously.) I did have a horse-crazy phase, memorized all the patterns. I remember I had a sticker book from Dover Publishers. The Appaloosa was my favorite, because it had 'freckles' like me. I loved Dalmatians for the same reason. Then I actually got to ride one with Scouts and boom, allergies. :/

So does anyone else have a story like that? Flower patterns, braiding hair, something traditionally feminine that clouded the picture you were making in your mind of 'being a man'? Did it take you longer to come to understanding your identity as a gay trans man? Did it add to the confusion?

cvpjlu,An Awkward Question,"Sorry for the ton of backstory but I feel like it's necessary for the questions I have.

So my egg cracked within the past few months and it's made me go back and contemplate a lot of things in my past (28 this year if it matters). I'm married to a wonderful woman, I have two kids (they're amazing), and since I was fifteen I've basically repressed all the trans signs/urges I used to feel in my youth (it was a huge point of contention with my parents from like age 11 on). I have what I call ""flare-ups"" with the dysphoria and gender questioning I've repressed, usually every couple of years and it turns into arguments with my friends and family, bad decision making, and deep depression. I decided when it happened again a few months ago that I wouldn't just tough it out again and I'd start doing something about it. My wife was understanding to the best point she could be, but her response was ""I love you, but let's talk more about this after you've talked to a therapist."" So I scheduled an appointment, but since my town is small-ish and in the deep south US, the one therapist I've found who's LGBT-friendly doesn't have an opening until October. Better late than never, I suppose but man it's far away..



Which brings me to the real meat of the issue. I can look back at my childhood and see pink-and-blue flags everywhere I look. Characters I liked and identified with, buying (and sometimes stealing) girls' clothes from stores to wear in secret, growing my hair out because it looked cuter, outright telling my parents I wanted to be a girl, hell I wore boyshorts to school my entire junior year because I didn't need anymore PE credits so the odds of someone seeing them would be next to zero. After a huge fight with my parents, though, I largely repressed all those feelings. I met a great woman and we're very happy together. And I don't really feel like that's changed, except for how I view our intimate relations lately. It's probably the biggest obstacle in my ""am I valid"" question. It's what makes me question if this is just me remembering things from my childhood and dwelling on it.



Sexual intercourse feels good. It's physically pleasurable, and the connection I feel with the woman I love is incredible. But then after, as we're holding each other, I can't help but think that if I was *actually* trans, wouldn't it be repulsive? Wouldn't I dislike the idea of having sex in that way? Doesn't the fact that I enjoy it mean this is all in my head? And it keeps me up, and it makes me feel really guilty and awful and I just don't know what to think or do. And while I of course plan to bring this up with my psych when I finally talk to them, some impromptu counseling would go a long way.

cvq1aa,AITA for not acknowledging a player's LGBT status?,"I'm the DM of my group, but we're all students so some of the players change now and then. I was having a lot of fun until this new semester. Only three sessions in and I'm feeling completely disinterested because of this new LGBT player. We just wrapped up a short campaign and the players who have decided to stay (core group +1) have handed me their character sheets. We met Saturday to do introductions and set the scene.

My core group of three have been with me since the start. I'm familiar with their expectations and they appreciate my storytelling(at least, there haven't been any complaints). I'm unfamiliar with this new player, and they have made it pretty clear that they expect this campaign to be absolutely full of conversations and interactions, rather than combat, glory, and magic. Their background felt like the draft of a short story full of strange and exotic characters, half of them being LGBT themselves, and a mix of characters that support her choices, family members, and some enemies who hate her for being trans.

I told them before Saturday that they will have to water down good portions of her backstory and motives, and that could significantly change who they are as a person. They told me they'd fix it. What she fixed did not help the complexity. On Saturday I told her that I'm not experienced enough to fulfil her expectations for this character. She can be trans, but I won't mention it because its not essential. I also said that the character feels pretty boring without her identity as a trans person. After some back and forth, she accused me of saying I thought she was trans for attention, paraphrased. That's not how I wanted it to seem, so I relented. Now I'm stuck with this decision.

It's a lot of work just getting the campaign to make sense. They expect me to rewrite significant portions of the mid to endgame to accommodate for her personal victory over her imaginary transgressors. I feel like I'm in a situation where if I give an inch, they'll take a mile. Don't get me wrong, I love improvising, one of our fondest memories was so off script that it actually formed a good portion of this current campaign.

I should say that i'm bi, so it's not a new subject for me. I'm not vocal about it because I don't need people to know and I don't feel like its something I need to celebrate. My personality does not require any suppliment. Only people I've had romantic interests in know, and i'm perfectly fine with that.

I'm unprepared to invent a story for this person. I think it's rude to expect a significant side story that only one person will enjoy. That's an assumption, who knows, maybe the others will enjoy it. I, however, will not enjoy telling the story.

She made it through boot camp, and clearly wants to stay. The rest of the group is indecisive. Am I just an ignorant old dude?

(POSITIVE :D)","So, when I came out to my brothers, one of the only questions was, “so, what does [niece] call you?” At the time, she was barely talking yet, so it didn’t seem like a pressing problem. I suggested she call me Mimi. My youngest sibling called me Mimi growing up, as a simplified version of my birth name, but I adore it as a title. So my brother agreed I would be Mimi Parker to my niece. 

That was the last I heard about it until this past Friday. I don’t get to see my niece very often, and when I do she’s usually a little shy. I assumed she hadn’t quite taken to me due to the lack of social time we’ve had together (and she’s only 2 next month. We haven’t built a strong relationship yet due to that + the already mentioned lack of time together). I honestly didn’t even think she knew me well enough yet to associate me with a name/title.

Then, I saw her and my brother on Friday. And she called me Mimi out of the blue! I just about died. I’m officially Mimi, and she’ll tell me “hi, Mimi,” and “bye, mimi!” And gods it’s just so adorable.

I'm turning 31 and hopefully soon will be able to start HRT which makes me super happy but I am super anxious about possible expectations of hair regrowth. I have some thinning on the top of my head (no bald spots yet fortunately) and a bit of male pattern baldness thing going on and while I could kinda otherwise pass after a while and with effort, I am very conscious of my hairline. 

I have a fairly big forehead and it would be nice to cover it with bangs or such but at this time the thinning is a bit too much to have enough hair for that... so I'm wondering if it can get reversed a bit or at least stopped with HRT? Google only leads me to the same article which says yes, and shows some great results, and yesterday I saw someone post a 4 month HRT results in which she said that hair is growing more thick/bushy now in places where it was not that thick before, but I'd like to know some more experiences to ease my anxiety :/ 

Also, I have long hair now and I've been wondering should I cut my hair short again to ""start over"" with hair growth or should I keep what I have and the possible regrowth/thickening will happen regardless?

So my wife and I (both women) have been trying to find resources that are a little more specific. Maybe some LGBTQ BDSM educators even, with online blogs, books, or talks?

I’ve always had a strong imagination with things, I even love to read and write in my free time. My parter, however, is a little more Type A than me struggles with coming up with scene ideas on her own. I think this is also partially impeding her confidence. 

We’ve talked at length over this past year (been together for almost 10), about limits and what we’re both willing to try and want to try in regards to bdsm. When she’s able to get past the insecurities (I.e. she worries about doing something wrong, hurting me, looking silly etc), she enjoys topping. I’ve listed several scenarios of types of things I’d love for her to try, but when it comes down to an actual scene, she’s never sure where to start. The last two times, she’s tried to just “go with the flow” with what she felt like doing, as I’ve suggested, but like I said she usually doesn’t know where to start, so I guess  I’m looking for scene examples of things we could try? We’re both relatively inexperienced sexually as far as partners go. I’m her first and she’s only my second. However, every time I try searching anything related to lesbian domination, 99% of the hits are just porn, as you can imagine lol. We’ve looked through some of that too, don’t get me wrong, just looking for more I guess. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of lesbians into the BDSM scene, but I’m wondering if that’s just a misconception I’m picking up on?",,BDSMAdvice,https://reddit.com/r/BDSMAdvice/comments/cvvfzg/prevalence_of_lgbtq_members_in_bdsm_lifestyle/

For a while I've noticed that some non-binary people and the people who refer to them (specifically those who use they/them pronouns) will sometimes use gendered terms to refer to themselves or have people refer to them with gendered terms. e.g. Ash Hardell, a LGBT YouTuber ,referring to their spouse, who is non-binary and was out as such in the video title in which it was mentioned, as their wife. This confuses me. Would it not cause them to feel invalidated? If so why not? Any and all responses are appreciated.

cvhjni,Thoughts on the NA East Cup champs today....,"Alright. I'm on suuuuuuper thin ice bringing this up, and I'm sure I'll be called hypocritical or gender-traitor or whatever, but watching the NA East Cup today gave me... feelings.

First off: I'm a skater for Detroit, so I had some skin in the game today. I'm not all-star yet, but I aspire to be next season. I'm also a trans woman. Today Detroit played an awesome game against Sailor City and Detroit lost by about 100 points.

Sailor City has two AMAZING jammers. Whatever I say is not meant to detract from their talents. KQ and Jules have some incredible amount of talent. With this being said, they also aren't women. This isn't meant to be transphobic or exclusionary. Everything that I have heard says that they have come out as trans dudes and take hormone supplements to achieve the hormone levels of cis men.

It was really frustrating watching one of these jammers, who is very obviously trans masculine (beard, etc) score 200 points and win MVP for the weekend during a major tournament for the Women's Flat Track Derby Association. I get that they have a ton of talent and I don't want to diminish that. However, I have spent the past 6 years working my ass off to take hold of my legitimacy as a woman. I'm very lucky to have a league of amazing people who accept me as I am. I'm very conflicted about this though. Of course I believe that trans women have a place in the WFTDA. I have the hormone levels of a cis woman, and have for nearly 5 years now. My body is hardly that of a male anymore.

I want to be inclusive and welcoming to anyone who wants to join derby, but I really struggle with the notion of being cool with people who aren't women (either cis or trans men) play such a prominent role in this sport, whose very name states that it is a Women's sport. 

Once, last year, we had a discussion about removing gendered language from our league. The argument was brought up that there are people who consistently struggle for legitimacy as women. Roller derby is where we find that sense of belonging. Removing those terms wouldn't be inclusive, it would be erasure for the women in the WFTDA who struggle to find acceptance. I feel that having trans men, or trans masc people playing in the WFTDA is a similar scenario. I absolutely love this sport mostly because of its empowerment and the love and friendship that I have with all the women on my team. I feel like such a fucking hypocrite and traitor feeling this way, but it really makes me uneasy.

I don't know what the right course of action is anymore. I know that my feelings cannot be the sole decider for which direction a league, or even the WFTDA as a whole, should move in. I'm just troubled.... I'll be over in the corner by the tar and feathers if anyone needs me.",trans woman,rollerderby,https://reddit.com/r/rollerderby/comments/cvhjni/thoughts_on_the_na_east_cup_champs_today/
cvm6aa,Contrapoints' newer videos feel strangely alienating.,"So I've always like Contrapoints videos.  Even if I feel like they didn't quite hit the mark, they're always thought provoking, and honestly I still enjoy most of the newer episodes, but a newer, more empty feeling has surfaced as well.

It feels like somehow I've been mischaracterized or pushed aside even though Contrapoints, as another trans woman, has absolutely no obligation to represent trans women or to share my same ideas or experiences.

I don't really know what to make of it.  Maybe Contrapoints' content has shifted and I'm not the target audience anymore.  Maybe I never was the target audience.  Even the videos specifically about the experiences of being trans often feel completely foreign.


**Edit:** Holy shit this blew up.  It seems like people are using this thread to air general grievances about the channel, which I think is fine and discussions like this can be good.  Just try to remember it's pretty unfair to put content creators on pedastools because they will *never* live up to our expectations.  Especially someone under as much pressure as Contrapoints.

Also, a lot of people seem to think I'm mostly refering to her ""Men"" episode but I've been feeling this way ever since ""The Aesthetic"" which definately felt like it was supposed to be for trans people, at least to me.  I can in most cases watch people talk about experiences completely outside mine and not be like ""buh, wuh?  But I'm not a cis male?  I don't geeeeet iiit.""  but this is a pretty unique feeling that I get from Contrapoints videos.",trans woman,BreadTube,https://reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/cvm6aa/contrapoints_newer_videos_feel_strangely/

cvthzj,Please let me know if i’m in the wrong forum. I’m a little stressed out about who I am right now because I’ve discovered that being unhappy as a girl is not something everyone experiences. oops. Could I have some advice?,"This is my first post ever, and it’s a Secret Account™️ because I don’t want my parents to find this. (edited for formatting and grammar)

Okay, so basically I’m a teenager who recently realized that maybe i’m not a girl? Like i understood that you didn’t have to be your assigned gender but it never clicked that that applied to me. But it turns out that most girls are actually comfortable being a girl :O so I’m not sure what to do. 

I’ve read some websites which focus on people questioning their gender and I feel like some of the things stated applied to me but a lot of the sites said stuff about wanting to do more masculine things as a young kid but I can’t remember a time when that was true of me. (sorry if my terms are incorrect or if I say something wrong, I’m kind of just trying to figure out what I’m saying as I go) 

I don’t know how to describe the discomfort I have, so I’m sorry if this is vague

I’ve only spoken to one friend about this, but she can’t really help me figure it out because she’s not dealing with the discontent that I am, so I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this. My other friends might think I’m being stupid or might just leave. 
Another thing is that I still enjoy “girly” things like dressing up (though I’ve never worn makeup). I know that sounds kind of silly but I just don’t know what to do. 

I am just wondering if anyone has felt the same way as me? Is there anything I can do to make this a little clearer for myself and allow myself not to stress over it (lol i can clear up some things about the post if needed as well).

cvtb77,Are you (ENTPs) emotionally 'resilient'?,"As title - I would like to know from other ENTPs if you consider yourself (or others consider/state you to be) emotionally resilient, 'tough', immune to anything emotional?

In general I'm pretty immune to things like other people's feelings (although I take them into account as 'information that logically needs to be considered'!) and I am good at bouncing back from things, or holding it in BUT sometimes, when something gets me (usually about animals rather than humans!) or if I have a disturbing dream or something like that... I can get sort of disoriented by it for a while, maybe more so than most people? (I think this is a legit use of 'discombobulated'!)

I seem to be perceived by most people as emotionally quite 'tough'. Broad shoulders that they can offload anything on to and I will come up with solutions rather than getting upset myself, stuff like that. Or I just let situations that would bother other people bounce off me cos I have a well developed sense of choosing my battles and knowing when to engage with the enemy and when not to :)

It's not that ""something gets me"" from absorbing things from others, though. That never happens. It's always something that I see/hear/read/experience/etc first-hand myself, that somehow eludes the usual ""input-immediate response-output"" loop.

Is it just a case of feeling 'something' and being unable to process that sensibly? (I am mid 30s but less developed than my age in some ways!)

(I am as sure as you can be that I'm ENTP and not e.g. ENFP though!)

As an example... I read something in the news which I won't repeat the detail of but let's just say it was about an accident, at work, that resulted in the death of two 20-something blue collar workers at work and dying horribly as a result of a freak accident. For some reason (that I can't identify -- I feel like if I could really pin down ""why"" this got me in the feels it would help...) this really got a visceral reaction from me and I felt horrible for days! I didn't know these guys, were they messing around? doing something stupid? I dunno, maybe they just went off to work that day and everything was normal until it wasn't.

I do have a sense a lot of the time of how precarious everything is, and how it could change instantly through any number of possibilities -- I don't get paralyzed into ""not going out"" in the morning because of it, but I can see how easily someone could.",,entp,https://reddit.com/r/entp/comments/cvtb77/are_you_entps_emotionally_resilient/

cvxtwy,Being GC in fandom,"I've talked about this in some of my other comments and posts, but I wanted to talk about it a bit more at length and see if anyone else can relate on this.

I'm a bit of a nerdy girl, like so many women are theses days-- into video games, film, tv shows-- and while fandoms have existed for decades, the juxtaposition of fandom and the ""queer"" movement has been a recent change in the culture. And as much as it's been nice on the surface that there is a strong push in popular fiction to include LGB people and other minorities, there always seems to be asterisk over it that leads back to heterosexual relationships.

The source material is bad enough, with the bury your gays trope being so commonplace, bisexual characters exploring dating other women but ultimately ending up with a man, and of course the distinct lack of female characters to begin with. But then when you get into fandom spaces, it's a cesspool. Women fetishizing gay men, while also claiming one half of a gay couple is actually a transman, and therefore can get pregnant. Men fetishizing lesbians, either by forcing them to be ""turned straight"" through rape or making their partners be trans.

There is no talking through it, there are constant concern trolls asking if you support trans people, if you'd let them have access to your own body for the sake of ""being an ally"". So many other artists and writers I know will mindlessly repeat the rhetoric of ""trans women are women!"" Yet they're the first ones to like my tweets when I make subtle gender critical posts. It's amazing how many people agree with GC concepts when you avoid buzz words, honestly.

I get a lot of flak personally because I'm a lesbian and I'm a butch, and I like to draw lesbians in my fandoms. I'm constantly getting asked to draw trans women, being reminded when I talk positively about women to include the trans women too, and being mocked anonymously for drawing butch women. I've started a series of drawings where I reimagine existing male characters as women, to see how differently the world they come from would treat them for their sex. I intentionally make them look natural-- no overinflated breasts, makeup, long hair (unless their original male self had it) and you would not believe how much it pisses me off. People call me transphobic for drawing men as ""cis"" women, when I could draw them as trans women instead; they flat out tell me my drawings are of trans men instead of women and mock me for what I'm doing; they go out of their way to tell me that butch women ""are ugly"", ""look like men"", etc. My being ""cis"" is used as an insult, and I'm accused of being privileged for being a biological woman. Ha. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to snap and just go full GC on main, but I worry about that affecting my income as an artist.

Anyway, my point with all this was not only to share my experience but to see if any of you ladies have experienced anything similar. Obviously fandom isn't comparable to activism or real life experiences, but it's a creative outlet for myself and many other women, and in the end it's  yet another space that is being slowly but surely taken from women.",transman,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cvxtwy/being_gc_in_fandom/
cvuvob,Entitled Parent yells at me for Using the Bathroom,"So this story was a couple of months ago but it is still the craziest entitled parent moment I have ever had.

I was on my way to work and I was dressed in a black t-shirt, push up bra (relevant), jeans and sneakers. I should also mention that because my hair is short I am frequently mixed up with being a guy but I go to extra lengths to make it a little easier on people who don't notice boobs or a lack of Adam's apple. Usually, I wear makeup and make sure to always wear pushup bras and women's clothes so no one questions me.  
Anywho on my way to work, I really need to pee, like OUTSTANDINGLY SO. The kinda pee that consumes your every waking thought. So I stop at the shopping centre to use the bathroom, I walk into the female bathroom and I get a few funny looks (nothing unusual, I understand) but most people just do a quick double-take then mind their own damn business.  
Once I finish my quest I go to wash my hands and that when I meet Entitled Mum (EM) and her kid, a little boy about 5-6 years old.

EM: \*Ahem\*  
I glance at her briefly but just go back to washing my hands  
EM: Excuse me?  
Me: Yes?  
EM: You're in the wrong bathroom  
Me: Pardon sorry?  
EM: BATHROOM, you need to go to the other bathroom  
Me: With all due respect Ma'am, I'm a girl  
EM: I don't want my little boy growing up thinking that people can just use whatever bathroom they please, you need to leave.

Now usually I'm a very chill person, I'd just walk away and leave her to her little entitled life but that day I was in a good mood so I decided to give her a piece of my mind.

Me: Ma'am, I'm a girl, a woman at that, I have just as much a right to be in this bathroom as you do, furthermore I am washing my hands, getting ready to leave - just treat me with the respect of everyone else in this bathroom and leave me be.  
EM: I don't know what's wrong with you trannys but I just want to go to the bathroom without you flaunting yourself everywhere

Now I was TICKED

Me: Ma'am, I have treated you with nothing but respect, I have been understanding and considerate but all you have done is continued to berate me and use slurs that are extremely offensive. So I'm going to tell you for the last time, I'm a girl, born a girl, will die a girl, here is my student ID card from an all-girls school, my license which says that I'm a female. Furthermore, here is a picture of me as a baby, dressed in a pink frilly dress. If that isn't enough to prove it to you, you should just mind your own damn business.

I hope i can do it, only about 35 people in total will have known me in the past. Only about 25 will be able to recognize me. Maybe 15 are friends or people I'm comfortable with. So I'm thinking of telling my counselor, they had offered to change my name just in the school, they told me that a high school counselor could probably do the same. But... Im out to my parents and they didn't take it too well. They still don't believe me and keep telling me that i shouldn't talk to the counselors and instead talk to them so i can be 'true to myself', aka be what they want. If they were to find out i changed my name at school, that would be a problem. I'm going to tell my new robotics teammate, they seemed okay with the idea of Kino (an anime character) being trans, to call me Shinsha.

Anyways, I gathered matches quickly, had some fun conversations. In one of these conversations, me being trans came up, the guy got mad, and asked why I hadn't marked it down in my profile. I apologized, realized I could do that, and did so. Well... all my matches disappeared, some leaving rude messages about trolling, most just ghosting me. Since then I'm not really matching with people, and some of the people I do match with seem to have some unfortunate ""expectations."" 

Now, look, I'm not gonna suddenly surprise anyone with a dick. But I do wonder if it would be better if I could explain that I'm trans in person, where maybe it would be less... I don't know, suspicious? More earnest? Less pre-judgey? I'm not looking for hookups so I don't think anyone would be expecting a vagina by the end of the night to begin with. 

I'm gonna guess the answer is a no. So I'm leaving it up for now. But any advice would be welcome.

EDIT: For future people finding this post, I think I'm going to just disable my account. Dating would be nice, but it's not worth being out as trans in a public space.

cvvmha,My experience coming out as transgender to my church.,"So, I thought a while about posting this here. I know that my identity and existence is already something of a trouble for people even in the secular world. That I have come out as a transgender Christian and transitioned was something I never thought I would do. My journey has led me to such an amazing place though, one where I am closer to God than I have ever been in my life, one where I am closer to my church family than I ever thought I would be, and one that has humbled me and my misconceptions about Christianity.

I first knew I was transgender at 12 years old. In rural south Louisiana, there was not much I could do about it. I had conservative parents and lived in a deeply red area. The church services I would go to condemned people like me and spoke of LGBT people with the meanest language possible. It was dehumanizing and I quickly came of the perception that the church did not have a place for a person like me.

So at 13, I became an atheist much to my dad and mom's chagrin. I never transitioned and once I made it to 20 years old, I figured that being transgender would just be too difficult and I would try to grit through life as a man. I still lived in the deep south and the prospect of transitioning seemed scary to me. I still avoided churches.

It wasn't until 30 years old, freshly divorced, that I started attending church again. It was a PC(USA) Church that I decided to go to... humble little building, beautiful worship hymns and the kindest people I ever met. I didn't know their ideological slant and didn't care much - their true kindness showed to me at a time I felt very broken post divorce was enough for me. I did choose PC(USA) because I knew they were fairly tolerant of diversity - I had thought being trans was behind me, but I knew that I wanted to be part of a church that was open to others. That being said, this particular PC(USA) church didn't seem to take any stance on this stuff.

After talking to a therapist for many months, I determined that I was in fact still very much trans, and wanted to transition. I started hormones and hid things for 4 months, but the changes became harder and harder to hide. The thing that concerned me the most out of everything was my church, though - I had found such a loving place that cared for me and my son, and I feared that I would lose that church. I was mentally transported to a time and place where I was condemned from the pulpit and made to feel like I was inhuman and disgusting. 

I nearly didn't even give my new church a chance - I nearly left the church to transition.

But god I am so glad that I did not make that choice. Instead, I spoke to an elder of the church. She has a trans daughter, come to find out, who didn't feel comfortable going to the church for the same reason I didn't. But I told her that I wanted to, that everyone was so kind and nice and that I wanted to give it a chance. So we spoke to our pastor together.

Our pastor was accepting and kind to me, and said that he would gladly change my name in the register and that I of course was always welcome to worship, and that he'd do anything he could to make me feel comfortable and integrate me within the church body. 

A few days later, I came out on Facebook and let the word travel through the church. Numerous people on Facebook liked my status, and that next day, I was flooded with requests to sit beside them in church. Here is a sampling of them. The kindness and love still moves me to tears. Names are obviously removed:

https://i.imgur.com/UWV17K8.png

I went to church the next day and had more than enough people sitting around me as I presented myself as I am, dressing as I wanted to dress and going by my new name. I was actually mistaken for someone's daughter which gave me a bit of a giggle. 

Ever since that first day, I have gone to every service since. The women of the church gathered together and gave me clothes since replacing my wardrobe is so expensive - I must have gotten $1,000 worth of new clothing from the collective church body. Some of the more conservative members of the church have come up to me and thanked me and invited me for lunch to just speak with me. I'm open about everything with them, it's a journey we are going through together. The kids seem respectful and the parents are openly loving and accepting. 

All this to say... the church is a very scary place for many LGBT people. Transitioning in a church is not something I ever thought I would do. Receiving clothes from the church? Absolutely not something I ever expected to happen. But I am part of a church family that loves me for me, and that loves God and worships together with me at their side, not ashamed but happy to have me with them. I'm involved in my church's social media, I volunteer when I can, and I feel like I've found a home for my heart when for so long it felt homeless. Even in the face of my parents rejecting me for religious reasons, my church has become my truest family.

I hope that those of you with LGBT members in your church can do the same. It means the world to a person like me.

**TL;DR:** Left Christianity at 13 because I was secretly trans, joined back at 30, came out in church and transitioned, the church respected and loved me, gave me clothing, and I am closer than ever to God and my church family.",transgender,Christianity,https://reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/cvvmha/my_experience_coming_out_as_transgender_to_my/

cvq1aa,AITA for not acknowledging a player's LGBT status?,"I'm the DM of my group, but we're all students so some of the players change now and then. I was having a lot of fun until this new semester. Only three sessions in and I'm feeling completely disinterested because of this new LGBT player. We just wrapped up a short campaign and the players who have decided to stay (core group +1) have handed me their character sheets. We met Saturday to do introductions and set the scene.

My core group of three have been with me since the start. I'm familiar with their expectations and they appreciate my storytelling(at least, there haven't been any complaints). I'm unfamiliar with this new player, and they have made it pretty clear that they expect this campaign to be absolutely full of conversations and interactions, rather than combat, glory, and magic. Their background felt like the draft of a short story full of strange and exotic characters, half of them being LGBT themselves, and a mix of characters that support her choices, family members, and some enemies who hate her for being trans.

I told them before Saturday that they will have to water down good portions of her backstory and motives, and that could significantly change who they are as a person. They told me they'd fix it. What she fixed did not help the complexity. On Saturday I told her that I'm not experienced enough to fulfil her expectations for this character. She can be trans, but I won't mention it because its not essential. I also said that the character feels pretty boring without her identity as a trans person. After some back and forth, she accused me of saying I thought she was trans for attention, paraphrased. That's not how I wanted it to seem, so I relented. Now I'm stuck with this decision.

It's a lot of work just getting the campaign to make sense. They expect me to rewrite significant portions of the mid to endgame to accommodate for her personal victory over her imaginary transgressors. I feel like I'm in a situation where if I give an inch, they'll take a mile. Don't get me wrong, I love improvising, one of our fondest memories was so off script that it actually formed a good portion of this current campaign.

I should say that i'm bi, so it's not a new subject for me. I'm not vocal about it because I don't need people to know and I don't feel like its something I need to celebrate. My personality does not require any suppliment. Only people I've had romantic interests in know, and i'm perfectly fine with that.

I'm unprepared to invent a story for this person. I think it's rude to expect a significant side story that only one person will enjoy. That's an assumption, who knows, maybe the others will enjoy it. I, however, will not enjoy telling the story.

She made it through boot camp, and clearly wants to stay. The rest of the group is indecisive. Am I just an ignorant old dude?

I would marry any race of or ethnicity if I loved her. I just don’t understand why if other races can have a strong preference, well not even strong preference, it’s almost like a code of conduct and won’t date outside of their race, it’s like it’s congratulated by society at large. 

Think about the old Jewish mom or grandma talking to her son or grandson “Ari, you need to settle down and find you a nice Jewish girl.” That’s totally fine and almost heartwarming. If a white dad were to say To his daughter “you need a good white husband” the general public would have a shit fit, but it’s the same thing. I’d argue the desire is just as valid.

I was in a serious relationship with an Indian woman once. One time we ran into this Indian family on the streets in San Francisco and the dad was giving me these dirty looks. I’m mostly Caucasian. My gf laughed and said Indian fathers hate it when they see white dudes with Indian women. She said it sets a bad example because they want them to be with Indian men. That kind of thing is acceptable in India with of course majority Indian population. If a white dad glared and gave shit to a couple with a white girlfriend and Indian guy, he’d be considered a klansman and horrify society. It’s the same thing. It’s identical.

cvoldo,So I browsed the MtF subreddit a little bit...,"and to my surprise, I found some posts and several comments describing feelings of ""euphoria"" and ""validation"" when being cat-called.


I had to do a triple-take, because frankly, I could not believe my fucking eyes.


They have the sheer audacity to say things like, and I quote, ""conflicted emotions"", ""I felt happy"", ""Tbh I reeeeallly want to be cat-called lol. That would be validating af"" and ""I'm feeling so euphoric that I pass"".


These lunatics wrote that ""cis-women"" probably experience the same sense of ""validation"" when being given unwanted sexual attention by men.


 The fuck I do!! The only feelings I experience when being cat-called and crudely jeered at as I walk down the street, minding my own business in a baggy sweater, a bare face with messy hair and men's jeans is PURE FUCKING RAGE and a very unique mixture of helpless sadness and heavyhearted disappointment.


 It's not a ""euphoric thrill"", Its a sudden rush of adrenaline and genuine terror, when twice they walked too close and looked at me like an actual fucking predator, as they stood half a meter away. I felt like a juicy, medium-rare stake. And as I quickened my step and felt my sudden anger get replaced by dread, I wondered  why the fuck this was happening to me. They told me that If I dress like I do this shit wouldn't happen. They lied! 


One time of these two, I turned around after several seconds from having encountered him (and physically dodged him), to see him looking back at me from a block behind as he walked in the opposite direction. He had turned his head towards me, and I will never forget his eyes looking straight into mine and the crude grin he had on his face  even if I looked at it for less than a second because I flipped my shit and turned, very fast, back to my house. He knew he was scaring me, that's why he did it, he was evil.



These scum at MtF have no shame. They straight up type out such hysterical absurdities, re-read them, post them and then upvote them, without once questioning and acknowledging the glaring delusion evident in their writings.

cu4422,Not trans but a femboi,"I'm a 27 y/o bio-femboi (or cis for you sjw's out there), and I started on mtf hrt about 3 years ago b/c fuck turning into a bald ugly man. The problem is no one sees me as a boy anymore! It's ma'am everywhere I go; I keep getting kicked out of the men's room. and gay men tell me they don't need a fag hag whenever I try hooking up. How bad did I fuck up? Should I just accept that I'll never look like a femme AGP and become a tranny, or should I detrans and make it my personal goal to stop transes from getting hrt?",mtf,transgendercirclejerk,https://reddit.com/r/transgendercirclejerk/comments/cu4422/not_trans_but_a_femboi/

I’ve posted on this forum for 3 years now and this is the first time I’ve ever received such a PM. Both the accounts were brand new.

cvpit9,I was kind of disappointed in the most recent video.,"**EDITED TO FIX ERRONEOUS STATISTICAL CLAIM**  


I don't want to hammer too hard on the idea of ""political responsibility"" because I think it's 1. boring and 2. sets an undefined (and therefore unattainable) standard.

That said, I thought there were a lot of places where the video would have benefited from slightly more rigorous context:

1. She talks about the emotional harm of being perceived as dangerous. I'll admit that this isn't something I had considered empathetically before, and I appreciated the perspective, but she frames the inequality as being between feeling afraid and feeling scary, without acknowledging that women's fear comes from a very rational place. Women experience violence at the hands of men at very high rates. I think it's okay to acknowledge that thing 1, which might be better than thing 2, is still bad, and in that sense I'm glad for the perspective on how harmful being perceived as dangerous can be, but I wish there could have been a balancing statement/argument. 
2. She talks about Warren Farrell's idea of male disposability, another new concept for me and one I think really deserves our attention. It's definitely true that there is a *narrative* of disposability when it comes to men's lives, and I think the psychological harm and despair of that shouldn't be understated. But again, it feels, for lack of a better word, a little irresponsible to make that point and just leave it there without also saying, for instance, that women are far more likely to die of treatable medical emergencies because doctors **don't believe them** when they describe their symptoms, or that women are nearly 20% more likely to be hurt of die in a car accidents because car companies aren't required to test with female crash dummies. Again, narratives are powerful sources of harm for both men and women, but before we lament too much about men *feeling* disposable, I really think it's important to examine the ways in which women's lives *are* disposable. 
3. I was frustrated that Natalie framed the fraught issue of cat-calling (and scrutiny of women's appearance in general) as being tension between liking unsolicited compliments and not liking unsolicited compliments. My problem with the patriarchal scrutiny of my appearance isn't that I feel seen only for my physical beauty and sexual appeal for men when in fact  ""I have so much more going on on the inside,"" or whatever. My problem is that I feel VALUED only for my physical beauty and sexual appeal to men, which, in my case, is basically not existent because I'm a fat, hairy, butch lesbian. Walking through the world, just trying to live my life, people don't smile at me, they glare at me. People stand between me and their children. Men often do things for me without my asking, like hold doors, or lift luggage, but they do so with thinly veiled disgust and resentment that they would be socially obligated to help such a repulsive woman who had not earned their manly assistance by being pleasant to look at. Again, I think it's fine to talk about how being invisible can be painful, but women don't have the option of being invisible: they can either meet patriarchal standards of grooming, femininity, agreeability, and beauty, or be reviled. I'd rather be invisible than reviled. 

I don't want to imply that Natalie should have rehearsed all of feminist theory just to make a point about men's needs/struggles, and I agree with the overall premise of the video, that men suffer under patriarchy, and that men need a positive ideal of manhood. I'm not totally sure what would have solved the problem, tbh, I just think I would have appreciated a firmer stance on male privilege, though maybe Natalie's whole point is that she doesn't have one? ",,ContraPoints,https://reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/cvpit9/i_was_kind_of_disappointed_in_the_most_recent/

cvzvtf,Advice on Gender,"Not sure if this is the right place but here goes.
So, after contemplating for a while I finally ordered a chest binder! 
My chest (and voice) triggers the most dysphoria so I'm glad to have ordered it. Although, I'm still unsure if I am trans. I experience dysphoria and have always been uncomfortable being considered female but idk what the fuck gender am i (am i on the non-binary spectrum or trans?). 
I came to ask if anyone has advice on determining this or if I just have to give it time.",non-binary,ftm,https://reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/cvzvtf/advice_on_gender/
