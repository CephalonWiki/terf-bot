b0z7o7,Love how The Onion can see the bullshittery going on in sports right now.,1516,,54,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/b0z7o7/love_how_the_onion_can_see_the_bullshittery_going/
bhulic,I can't do this any more; I need to divorce my trans wife.,1500,"Married 10 years. We have two children 6, & 3. I'm 29, she's 31. This is probably going to be rambly, sorry. 

Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here. She's hated my wife since the moment wife and I met so I honestly don't know if she's a good person to talk about this to or if she's telling me what she thinks I want to hear. The only other person I've talked to about this is my sister and she thinks we should go back to couple's therapy. Friend told me what to expect from this sub and I've been lurking for a few days; for the sake of writing I'm going to refer to my wife as ""her"", because I don't want to accidentally call her 'him' offline -that's not pleasant for anyone the occasional time I slip up. 

Call her whatever you like when you reply, she's not going to see it and I have other things to think about. 

My wife is a trans woman and came to terms with it three years ago. Told me, started transitioning and all that. I love her. This wasn't a deal breaker and we talked to a couple's therapist and honestly everything was fine except for a few issues around my pregnancy and then our newborn. (Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)). 

We both work full time, and the budgets tight. Neither of us have a degree and we both only make a little more then minimum wage. We weren't perfect financially before our second child was born, but things weren't so tight.

I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras that I got with my first pregnancy after I outgrew my other bras. I don't wear makeup besides a bit of mascara and colored lip-gloss, and my skin care routine is simple as is my hair routine (I cut it myself and don't dye it or anything). I'm low maintenance  partially because I can't justify buying myself a new cheap bra when that $20 could go to our debt or something the kids need or something the kids want and partially because I don't feel like I need to wear a ton of makeup or stuff like that.  

My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.
 
We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs. 

I was fine with it all at first; writing this off as part of the costs of transition. I realize now though, that my wife is not going to *stop* racking up credit card debt for these things she thinks she needs. I go without, because I don't feel as though anything I want like a new bra is that needed for the family to incur more debt or to pay off that less debt that month. 

Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there. 

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would *help* because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it. 

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores. 

Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace came off her bra, thinking to myself ""I could have fixed it, come on, there's no need to act like this. And why is she so upset when she has four times the amount of bras then I do and hers are all much nicer than mine?"" Then I wondered why the hell I was doing her laundry, my laundry, and our children's laundry? She never does laundry.

She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't handle that. She called her friends in so there was a friend of hers at our home with them the *entire* time. By the way, she completely dropped all of her old friends and now the only friends she has are also trans women or non-binary or whatever. So that was a fun conversation to have because I only know like two of her friends well enough to babysit my children and she can't possibly know everyone to know they're safe to have around our kids. I got called transphobic for that one, by the way. She apologized, but the very fact that's what she jumped on instead of my concerns about who is in close contact with our kids? And maybe I'm paranoid, but I was molested as a child by a family friend which she *knows*. 


Oh, and her friends...besides the two I know, everyone else just aren't very nice to me if we at a gathering or host a party. I'm treated like the help instead of the cohost. Most of them have no interest in getting to know me or even talking to me and are on the edge of rude. She doesn't see it. 

I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything.  It honestly wasn't this bad when she was my husband. 

A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper city to live where we would buy a house. 

Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave""

Which stung, by the way. My current employer had me back at work three weeks after our 3 year old was born. They claimed there was an issue somewhere along the way and if I wanted to keep my job I needed to come back that soon. Probably not legal, but I was in no position to find out for sure. 

I told her that if we have the money for one of us to go back to school and stay at home with a baby, it's going to be ME. And brought up how long it took for me to fully heal from giving birth when I had to work -on top of the knowledge that I was missing out on time with our newborn. 

So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her, and how *she* felt watching me while I was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or of knowing she could never be pregnant and on and on and how another baby that she did the majority of care for would be her chance to be a real mother. And I ended up tuning her out, wondering if she's always been this selfish and self centered or if it was new. The conversation ended with us deciding to talk about it closer to my birthday. 

Maybe it's me, I don't know, but hearing her talk about having maternity leave when I was the one who would be giving birth, dealing with all that comes with that made me angry, really honestly angry for the first time in a long time. What kind of partner would be so callous? And it dawned on me that we aren't really in a real partner ship any more. I love her, but that's just not enough any more. 

**I just can't do this anymore.**

**Edit:** I already have meetings to talk to a few different lawyers and see what they say/how I feel about them next week. Like I commented, I think I was mainly posting here to be told I'm not a shitty person throwing away my marriage...I just want some support that's not biased towards my spouse I think. 

My older brother has already received his inheritance and is fully willing to let me borrow as much as I need for a good lawyer. I didn't talk to him about why I was thinking about a divorce like I did with my sister, just that I was....I think he's probably better to talk about this with then my sister given as soon as I said ""lawyer"" he immediately offered to loan me the money without me even asking.

**Edit Again:** Please don't pm me if you are trans or the spouse of a trans person, thank you. And I don't know what on earth a 'terf' is, why it's bad to be one or how to be one.",451,trans woman,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/bhulic/i_cant_do_this_any_more_i_need_to_divorce_my/

axccwr,Got removed as a moderator of TwoXChromosomes for agreeing with Sharron Davies' comments on transwomen in female sport.,1250,"Title says it all, really. 

I was a mod for around 10-12 months, not exactly sure. I've been a Reddit user for a long time, and when TwoX advertised that they were looking for moderators, I decided to apply because I always liked that there was a place on Reddit for women to talk and share with each other.

Pretty quickly after becoming a mod, I noticed that a lot of viewpoints were suppressed within the community, despite it claiming to be for ""women's perspectives"" - the perspectives of *certain* women, sure. I saw many innocuous comments and posts arbitrarily removed, not because they broke any rules, but because they did not agree with the moderator's personal points of view, and I didn't feel like I really 'fit in' with it. I even noticed some of my own comments being removed by other moderators.

Truth be told, I'd been considering leaving ever since an AMA with Daniel(le) Muscato was featured on the sub. I stopped participating  as much after that, either posting or moderating, but I didn't leave. A couple of days ago, someone posted an article about swimmer Sharron Davies' comments on transgender male athletes competing with female athletes, and I made a comment stating that I agreed with Sharron. Of course I agree with her, anyone with an understanding of human physiology would, right?

I log into Reddit today to find I've been removed as a moderator for ""transphobic"" comments - for daring to agree with Sharron Davies about transgender athletes. I never insulted anyone, I did not use abusive language, and I don't hate transgender people - I've suffered from clinically diagnosed gender dysphoria myself! I simply acknowledged the biological advantages that males have over females, and stated that if biological males are allowed to compete against females then women's sport is basically finished. The world has truly gone crazy. 

Edit: ~~I've had a couple of PMs asking me to provide the comment I made, or suggesting I am lying about the content of what got me removed. This is false, but I do not have the comment to provide - it was removed by another moderator, and I deleted it after that happened (wasn't the first time I'd had one of my comments deleted). I didn't know when I hit delete that I'd need it to defend myself - if I had, I'd have screenshotted it.~~ A kind soul actually saved my exact words, and posted them in the TwoX thread. Using removeddit I was able to find it. Here is the [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/gPyFR7T.png) of that comment, and here are the words I said:

> **I agree with her, too. It shouldn't be allowed. Allowing transwomen to compete in female sport will be the end for natal women who want to compete. You might as well get rid of sex segregated sport all together if you allow this, and just accept that no natal woman will win anything again.**


I ~~do, however,~~ also have an example that is very similar to the comment I made. [This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ontVazg.png) was taken from a thread about Rachel McKinnon, the trans cyclist who won the (female)  2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships. This is the type of thing that gets you removed, and potentially banned, from TwoXChromosomes. I have quite a few other examples.",298,transwomen,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/axccwr/got_removed_as_a_moderator_of_twoxchromosomes_for/
aneh4l,My kids are adopted.,1216,"About 2% of people are adopted meaning the vast majority of other mothers I interact with are not adoptive parents.

When a woman in my mom's groups asks, ""did any of you have postpartum hair loss?"" I don't shout, ""excuse me but not all of us gave birth! Therefore it's violent and exclusionary to talk about your birth experiences!""

I do not infiltrate mom groups and make it against the rules to discuss pregnancy, birth or the heritable traits they passed on to their children.

I do not need to be included in every human conversation. I am not the center of the universe. I understand that my experience is not the common one. When I wish to discuss it, I join a group of other adoptive parents and talk to them.

I love my kids with the same mama bear ferocity that biological mothers do but no matter how strong my feelings I am not now and never will be the biological mother of my children. I do not require society to participate in a fantasy in which I am. Even if I felt sad that I did not birth them I still would not push others to soothe me by pretending that I did.

Definition of parent: One that begets or brings forth offspring. I am not offended by this definition. I fulfill the social role of parent for my children but in most instances in both humans and animals alike, a mother is she who created her young. It is useful to have a word to describe female parents who birthed their young, because they are many, and they have unique needs (social, psychological, medical) and experiences.

My children and I probably share similar intestinal flora because we live together. My raising them has probably also affected their epigenetics and gene expressions. That still does not make us biological relatives. They do not have my DNA. I do not need to submit our samples to 23andme to prove it. 

I didn't birth but I profoundly care about the reproductive rights of my mother sisters, about accessible prenatal care and safe and humane childbirth practices across the world.

When each of my kids became legally mine, the state revised their birth certificates to put my name in place of their birth parents'. That still does not make me their biological mother. And many adoptees consider this practice to be offensive. A legal document cannot change their or my biological material reality.

I will love my children with every atom of my being until my last breath. I do not need to be biologically related to them to do so. It is ok for me to be something other than that. It is still beautiful, meaningful and, yes, our favorite word, valid.",84,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/aneh4l/my_kids_are_adopted/
b3pm7s,"I desperately tried to be accepting of trans women, but I no longer can.",1221,"I'm sorry if this isn't allowed. I just want to post my experience in a place that will hopefully support me because I am crushed.

When my male partner came out to me as trans I was fully supportive despite my hesitation and discomfort. I did all the research, even bought them their hormones. I gave them my clothing and welcomed them with open arms. I would do their makeup, I would do their hair, help them wax and give them advice. 

&#x200B;

Now, a few months later I'm pregnant. With twins. Apparently this makes them so dysphoric that they no longer want to be with me and while they do not like men sexually, they prefer to only date other trans women now. They couldn't have figured that out before you knocked me up? Thanks for ruining my life so you can play pretend better. Have fun with your ""lesbian"" fantasies while I deal with the utter shit storm you left behind. My pregnancy apparently has made them so dysphoric they've lost their mind and any capability of actually being a decent person. They've already started to talk to other people, all trans women, and are now openly ""repulsed"" by women and vaginas. My world and now my view point is just turned up side down.

&#x200B;

I just want to scream ""Deadbeat dad!"" A real woman can't just run away when this happens. You will never understand my experience and you don't care too, you'd rather run away to your comfort zone and play pretend.

How did I get tricked into thinking this side was the radical side? I'm sorry, you were all right. I should have known better.

cib07f,Hey Contrapoints,1116,"I know you're obsessed with this sub, so let it be known, it is because of you that I became a TERF. Before I came across your videos, I was your typical SJW liberal feminist. I had my doubts about trans people, about its misogynistic overtones, its illogical inconsistencies, its high risk-factors, its huge overlaps with the kink/bdsm worlds. But none of it made me peak. I trusted the trans activists I followed online. I ""submitted"" to them, as a ""privileged"" ""cis"" women should.

I didn't peak until I saw your videos and got a strong negative feeling I had never felt before. I saw right through you, and in that moment it all clicked. When I watched your gender critical video in a university classroom, and no one in the room had any questions or discussion points to make after it ended--odd for a philosophy class--red alarm bells started ringing. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I went with my gut and googled more about the gender critical movement, which I had never heard of before. I found that all my doubts that I had hushed through incessant group think were finally being responded to. I realized they were right. I also found out about your MRA past, your old rapey videos. I saw through your brand of champagne socialism. Unlike you, I was raised working class from a third world country and a real woman. You don't speak for me, or my sister, my mother, and my grandmother, or any of my female ancestors who have actually fought for the protection of women against all kinds of exploitation. And you never will. You are the oppressor you love to perform to hate.

I was led here. Thanks to you.

And I'm sure I'm not the only person you've peaked. I'm sure there are thousands of us, too afraid to say anything, but with ears and eyes open wide. And every time you make a video, or post a disgustingly sexist tweet, you peak more and more people. Just remember that.

Sincerely,

Proud TERF

agq3v6,I’m a gendercritical doctor and here is why I don’t prescribe HRT to MtFs.,990,"I’m a gendercritical physician in a liberal part of Germany. Here is why I don’t prescribe HRT for MtFs: 

While HRT is not dangerous at doses used to relieve symptoms in menopausal women, HRT in higher doses can and will cause health symptoms after a while.

Natural estrogen levels for women fluctuate depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle.
Yet MtFs bully physicians into keeping their Estradiol levels at a constant 200 to 300 pg/ml at all times. This is simply not realistic.
A woman her Estradiol levels are perfectly fine at 50 pg/ml too.
Most days of the month a woman’s Estradiol levels will not be at or around 200 pg/ml. These people are not mimicking a woman’s hormone system, they are inventing their own rules for endocrinology and they bully physicians into following their wishes. All their hormone treatment regimens are based on hearsay, not on factual research. 
They are obsessed with Estradiol only, while a healthy woman has a mix of Estrone, Estriol and Estradiol. You can’t just pick and choose whichever you want in your body and which not, a healthy woman has all 3 of these. Yet MtFs tell each other that they should only aim for as much Estradiol as possible and dismiss Estriol and Estrone as ineffective. Estriol is one of the most wellness guaranteed hormones in a woman’s body. Estriol gives you that beautiful rosy glow when you are pregnant and expecting soon. 
Estriol is a protective hormone. It ties off the effects of Estradiol and Estrone when these latter two are present in too high concentrations in a woman’s body. They supplement estrogenic activity when too little of Estradiol and Estrone is present, like during pregnancy when Estriol is the most abundant hormone, produced by the placenta together with Estetrol. 
These people tell each other to use massive doses of an anti androgen that was intended for use in prostate cancer patients and has hepatoxic side effects (Bicalutamide). They tell each other that less testosterone is better, often driving their testosterone levels under immeasurable amounts. Zero testosterone doesn’t make you feminine. It makes you chronically fatigued, prone to obesity, it makes your muscles atrophy, it makes your hair prone to fall out and it makes for retardation in basic brain functions.
These people tell each other to use progesterone rectally on a daily basis. What they don’t realise is that women have the same progesterone levels as men, except for 1 week a month when progesterone levels peak heavily.
They are not hormonally female. They are their own hormonal invention.

And physicians just keep prescribing. Scared to be politically incorrect.

I’m a physician who went into this branch to improve people’s lives.
I’m not going to prescribe a genetic male massive doses of hormones that are supranatural even for a genetic female’s body.

It’s never enough for these people. Their way or the highway.
And they are only harming themselves with it longterm.

bzruto,[Rant] I'm sick of the myth that society allows women to freely express emotions while men cannot,983,"In what fucking universe?  How many times were you told to stop overreacting or to ""just ignore him"".  

""It's easier for us to moderate your reaction than to prevent his behavior...""  Do you have brothers?  How many times did you get in trouble for crying or making a fuss and ""getting him in trouble"" because he hit you or took something from you?  My brother beat the ever living shit out of me regularly.  I had welts and bruises.  Black eyes.  If they couldn't dismiss the severity of the injury, the question became what I did to provoke.  Sometimes my crime was trying to play in the same room.  I should know better.

How many times did you get criticized for being too sensitive or overreacting or being hysterical because you stood up for yourself?  When you father made a cruel joke about how if you kept eating like that you'd end up as fat as your mother... When your father joked about fat or ugly women you saw out in public?  When you suffered from disordered eating or low self-esteem and you asked that he no longer comment on your eating habits because you were starting to really struggle.  When you spent days picking out the right words and the right tone and the right environment to ask someone who supposedly loved you to stop hurting you...

How many of you were taught to be agreeable and accommodating to the extent that you were exploited or abused by men in your life?  Boyfriends who trampled your sexual boundaries.  What exactly constitutes a rape?  You wanted to make him happy.  You wanted him to stop being angry.  Isn't that the same as consent?  

How many times were you made responsible for managing the emotions of men?  Not to mention playing nursemaid, nanny, secretary and therapist for friends and boyfriends and co-workers...

In what fucking universe are men's emotions not the center of every fucking conversation?  When you can't call your husband out for not doing the fucking dishes again despite repeatedly begging him to lighten your burden.  When you have to mollycoddle his feelings, even when he's trampling on yours with constant, blatant disregard or disrespect?

When the media is filled with glorified men and maleness.  When the women ground into the dirt by these great men's heels are an acceptable exchange for their greatness.  Domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual assault, emotional abuse, misogyny... None of these tarnish the inherent greatness of a great man if he's worthy enough.  ""He's under a lot of stress.""

When your body is a battleground for men's expectations and comfort.  When your hair, your skin, your clothes become an obstacle course for men's eyes.  Shave, hide your menstrual pads, dress modestly lest your presence make men feel unwelcome in your vicinity.

Men's emotions under the guise of ""logic and reason"" wherein voices are raised and language gets increasingly abusive when you disagree.  

If men want to foster positive masculinity, they're welcome to do so.  But I've spent enough of my life trying to coax, charm and coerce men into showing some fucking decency.

brwve7,I refused to wear the sticker this week,850,"(edited below) I started a new job recently at a major university. I knew what I was in for but the department I am in is hard sciences, not humanities and I needed to be away from my previous job.

We had orientation and it was to cover everything from computer security to social issues. in reality it was, out of the 3 hours, over an hour on pronouns and the cult speak leading up to the pronouns discussion. 

when we came in we were given a big blank sticker and a sharpie to write our name and pronouns on and put on our chests. I put my sticker, unmarked and unpeeled on my desk and handed my sharpie down the line. 

we were then paired up to get to know each other to introduce to the rest of the people in orientation. the first question was 'name, pronouns'. I gave my name and barreled through the rest of the questions. when she introduced me to the class she apologized for not having gotten my pronouns and I said that was ok, i hadn't given them. 

the person giving the orientation said, that's alright, you can just give them now. and I said no thank you. no apologies, no reason, no way to push the issue without really pushing. so, she pushed 'it's ok, it's easy to miss things, you can do it now'. and again, no, thank you. I don't do that '

so I got to sit there for the next 2 hours, the only person in the room without a sticker on and no one knowing what to call me (although, somehow, they all decided on' she/her') /s.

it was completely uneventful except for the initial shock on everyone's faces but it was a conscious decision on my part and I wanted to share because it's not like I can tell anyone in real life about it and have them understand my teensy rebellion.

I have to say, out of a 3 hour mandatory orientation to cover so many topics I found it offensive that a third of it was spent on pronouns. maybe 5 minutes at the end about race and nothing about disabilities.

edits: WOW! I was just looking to have a little celebretory post, i thought it likely i would be talking to myself. I had no idea this would resonate so hard with so many! thank you for the support, gold anwoo-hoos!

being that i didnt think it would be a traction post i didnt put in much detail. I was prepared to have a few additional pushes and responses, some of which I picked up here (I dont care how people feel the need to refer to me, etc), the main thing was making sure it was clear that i was not complying, not that I was confused or shy.

I also feel some responsibility to do this because I am extremely visually gender conforming (I couldnt be more gender conforming if I were Dolly Parton or Brit Brit) . I dont think it should always fall to the gnc women.

I am a bit disappointed in myself because there were 2 absolutely perfect additional moments to comment. 1 was when it was compared to religion, i bit my tongue not saying, 'like scientology or a cult?' and another was when it was masculine and feminine traits and feelings being discussed, I really wanted to say ""so, a personality? because surely you are not saying a woman cant aspire to be strong, independent and outspoken without being called a male?"" may be next time. building muscles, small reps :)",206,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/brwve7/i_refused_to_wear_the_sticker_this_week/

ar9dss,I am a psychiatrist and I am INFURIATED that I am not allowed to treat people suffering from gender dysphoria.,827,"For gender dysphoria, politics have overthrown medical science when it comes to treatment. Hormone replacement therapy and sexual reassignment surgery, when examined through exhaustive meta-analysis, fail to demonstrate  strong evidence of efficacy in alleviating the core behavioral distress of the condition.

Or to put it another way: Genital mutilation does not work for a psychiatric disorder. As providers we should be doing all we can to heal both the body and the mind. We are supposed to be guides to help the sick. But our duty has been hijacked and supplanted by political ideology.

Now that this travesty of medicine is the standard of care, we cannot even make progress in formulating treatments for gender dysphoria - for to treat it like the psychiatric malady it is, is to invite accusations of bigotry. 

In medicine, a delusion is a belief which is obviously at contradiction with reality. We see this most heavily in schizophrenia and sometimes severe OCD. In both cases it is extremely counter intuitive and harmful to tell the patient their delusional belief is valid and true. Yet in gender dysphoria this is what we are supposed to do as a society: Yes, your delusion is absolutely true, you are a beautiful woman and we will mutilate you and give you hormones when you are a small child.

God forbid I try and ever express my beliefs to my colleagues. Perhaps many share my own misgivings. But I cannot risk it. And so through inaction I am an accomplice - a breaker of my own Hippocratic oath - sacrificed on the altar of political correctness.

Fuck.




Edit: I also just think it's interesting to add, I had no idea this was a feminist sub-reddit.

csilz6,A minor pronoun victory in an uber woke city,821,"At a woman's business meeting in an uber woke city we are asked to introduce ourselves, our business and state our pronouns. 

The pronoun thing is new, and the facilitator is very earnest about it. 

20 women in the room and a visiting male guest speaker, invited to share his niche technical expertise. 

I am in a huge quandary about what to do, I don't want to bow to the pronoun social engineering, but don't want to get caught up in drama or jeopardize my professional reputation. 

Facilitator starts, and enthusiastically does the pronouns thing. 

Guest speaker man goes next, introduces himself with everything *except* the pronouns. 

*Shocked Pikachu face*

I tentatively don't read too much into it, he's a senior guy, he speaks alot, so I assume he's doing his standard intro, has forgotten the pronoun instruction, and that the facilitator hasn't pulled him up because he's a guest.

I'm wondering if I can use this tactic when it's my turn or if I'll get told off. 

Next woman goes - she also skips the pronouns! 

And then the next starts her intro before the facilitator can jump in with a pronoun reminder! And she skips the pronouns too! 

and the next, and the next, and the next... 

until we've all done our introductions and we've all ignored the pronoun stuff! All 20 of us. 

Honestly, I nearly burst out laughing I was so exhilarated. 

Yes it took a man doing it, and yes it was the mildest of passive aggressive rebellious acts, but it made me realize that so many people are going along with this nonsense for a quiet life but secretly think it's ridiculous.

c1eh1k,I asked the trans community abt my trans rapist and they told me to fuck off and respect pronouns- my story,755,"Wow, ok I wanna say thank you for all the people supporting me through this. 

I guess for those of you seeing this with no context, someone posted an anonymous question I posted to the asktransgender subreddit about how I struggle with respecting the pronouns of a trans woman who raped me in high school on this sub and it's blowing up.

I don't know how long the original post will be up on asktransgender. Seems like they're removing the bad comments that have been there for months now that they're getting criticism, so I guess I'll just post this here for backup with some updates to the story.

When I was in high school I was caught up in an extremely toxic, controlling ""friendship"" with this guy. Let's call him Arthur. Arthur was very popular in the school among popular crowds. This was the early 2010s, when people were starting to get ""woke"" but in an ""omg I love having a sassy gay best friend"" kind of way and not a true support of all LGBT people kind of way. 

This is a short way to say that the GSA at my school was crawling with straight girls clamoring for the drama of those ""fun sassy gay men."" The few lesbians or bisexual women in the GSA were barely given a chance to speak. There were no out trans people in the GSA. 

A lot of the times it was gay men sharing how they felt or straight people giving their out-of-place opinions or asking rude questions. Arthur was very popular for his ""sassy"" comments. He was witty, snarky, and cast as a lead or lead supporting role in every school play. 

I don't know how I managed to ""befriend"" Arthur. Maybe it was because he was into the same nerdy things as 14 year old me was. Maybe he was using me from the start. At the time I was out in the GSA crowd as a lesbian (now I ID as bi, but with a very strong leaning towards women) and didn't talk much. I mostly sketched in the corner. 

Arthur was a narcissist. He was very self centered and saw himself as this kind of... untouchable entity I guess? Everybody loved this guy. We went to a very earthy crunchy private school where outright homophobia like slurs and attacks weren't really a thing (or if they were I never saw them) and the faculty was very coddling to him. His family was very catholic and when he came out as liking both men and women it... wasn't pretty.

When I think about this, I'm kind of realizing these events line up. His home life got harder, and our relationship shifted. He started coming on to me. Saying he was interested in me. I told him I wasn't interested in men. So he started using me for other things. 

I was and still am a very crafty person. I liked to write, to bake and to draw. I liked to do makeup. He would make me bring him baked goods. Make me write stories for his characters. Make me draw him or his characters in dresses he liked. Make me bring my expensive makeup to get togethers to get him dolled up. If I didn't, he'd spread rumors. 

My reputation would crumble bit by bit every time I didn't do what he wanted. He'd tell people I did or said horrible things. The only friends I had were in that schools GSA, really, and they all LOVED him. 

If I didn't do what he wanted, he'd suggest to my friends they eat lunch at some other part of the (large) school grounds. I'd wander around looking for my friends only to not find them and eat alone. He'd always play this off as him needing ""space"" because I was being ""difficult."" 

If I went too long without giving him something, he'd suicide bait me. Send me messages saying ""awfully nice weather above the [local large bridge people jump from]"" at best and ""why don't you just go off yourself right now if you're gonna be a cunt like this"" at worst. He would put awful things about me on social media in the form of vague posts.

All this over me not bringing him cookies or not writing him a fucking fanfiction because I had SCHOOLWORK that I was ALREADY FAILING due to stress. I became a regular at the school nurses, feigning illness to try and get home. I started hurting myself. It was awful.

This culminated in a sleepover I and a few other people had with him, where the assault happened. He didn't... finish, to put it in a less disgusting way, but I tried everything. I told him no. I said to stop. He held me in place and laughed it off. And he didn't stop until I guess he just figured it wasn't worth it to finish himself off.

I didn't tell anyone. It happened in my own home. Under my own roof. I was so caught up in feeling special at having a ""friend"" who was so well liked that I ignored everything else. Blamed myself. Until that.

I took everything BUT the assault to school authorities. I was too ashamed. They entirely excused his actions, including the suicide baiting. They said because he was bi and out of the closet with a catholic family I had to understand he's probably lashing out. It was also a super earthy crunchy place, again, so they reiterated that they didn't believe in conflict and wanted us to work it out together.

They brought him in to talk with me. That enough was making me shake, and I was digging my nails into my legs to keep from shaking. I don't know why I didn't tell them I wanted to leave. I guess I was afraid of giving him the satisfaction of knowing I was afraid...

After seeing him fake-cry and show the counselor how I probably faked the posts by bringing in some he made on photoshop, I couldn't take it. I left the room in sobs. 

I switched schools not long after and finished high school at a different place. 

There was one incident at the second school where an incoming student transferring from my old school said they met someone who knew me, Arthur, who said hi, and I freaked out so badly I had to leave for the day. The concept of him knowing where I am scares me. But since then there were no incidents.

I went to college and kept up contact with only a handful of people from my first school, and honestly I only talk to one of them often. 

This friend is nonbinary, and was, at the time of the Arthur incident, one of my closest friends. They IDed at the time (not anymore) as a lesbian, and knew Arthur through GSA. I only told them after they left school with him the actual extent of what he did to me. 

They told me two months ago that their little sister who still knows Arthur, said that Arthur is an out trans woman now.

I found this out while venting about Arthur to them, when they said ""Arthur goes by Lana now, actually.""

I told them I really struggle to imagine Arthur as a person existing anywhere outside of who he was back then. I struggle to see Arthur as a woman. It's hard for me to see Arthur as anyone other than the man who left me with lifelong trauma and made me try and kill myself.

They stopped speaking to me. Said it was transphobic of me to do this. That's when I sent in the post to asktransgender. 

The responses of ""why don't you just talk it over"" have some morbid parallels for what my school told me. I hated looking at them. I hated myself for how my trauma was making it hard for me to visualize Arthur as a new person.

My friend has started talking to me again since then, but I try and only mention the Arthur incident in passing, and use ""that person"" or ""my abuser"" instead of any names or pronouns. It's very hard to format my thoughts genuinely while doing this, but there's not much else I can do.

That brings me to today... I find out this old post of mine has been brought back up on a radfem subreddit. 

Though I don't agree with everything people here seem to believe, I have to say it's refreshing to find people who don't believe I'm at fault for my trauma making it difficult for me to afford any respect, even just the respect of seeing my abuser as a person who continues to exist as a changed human or whatever, to someone who hurt me so badly. 

I don't want to clutter up the other post with this long winded thing, so I'm making this a new post. I'm sorry about that. You can ask me questions if you want, I can clarify things but I'd prefer to not talk in detail about the assault.

Edit: thank you for the gold stranger! Also to the people DMing me with support, thank you. For the people DMing me telling me to try and understand my rapist because of possible mental illnesses or other issues.

She stood her ground and refused to pay for the work but was later told that she was being a “Karen” by one of her friends. 

Had any man done the same, his actions would have not been questioned in the least. He would have been commended for being assertive and not being a “pussy.” It is so infuriating that the whole Karen trope is used to undermine women’s confidence and keep them docile for fear of being an annoying cliche that everyone hates.

You have to do a practicum at an agency in order to get your degree and my friend is doing hers at Planned Parenthood. I helped her with a protest on campus today talking about reproductive rights (we are in the deep south so we were expecting a lot of push back regardless). A lot of women came to help the protest with signs they had made on their own. My friend led a chant of ""no uterus no opinion"" and the protest ended well with little push back from the university. Later her supervisor came to her and said the local LGBTQ organization on campus had contacted Planned Parenthood and wanted to end their partnership because of the ""trans slurs and transphobic comments"" at the protest. She was shocked and asked what they were referring to and it came out that they were offended by the ""gendered language"" used. Now, of course, it's become a big thing with them and naturally reproductive rights for women are being pushed to the back again in favor of coddling men's need to be at the center of everything. 

My friend has to now sit down with her practicum supervisor and a delegate from the LGBTQ group.

bsjpde,"Cellulite is a female secondary sex characteristic and should be celebrated as a rite of womanhood, not despised or eradicated.",738,"It has to do with the way our bodies network fat. Female bodies create sort of a mesh network to support fat (female bodies are MUCH more hardy in times of stress) and it can present as delightfully lumpy. More than 90% of women have visible cellulite, but all women store fat in this manner.

Men’s lattice pattern collagen threads holds subcutaneous fat in a way that, when the skin expands because of the fat storage, it expands evenly. Women’s “pockets” expand unevenly when we accumulate fat, creating that orange peel effect. Our storage pattern means we can healthily store more fat than men. Like a woman with 25% body fat is average, a man with 25% body fat is chubby. Because of that, women are hardier in times of stress or famine. It’s also one of the reasons why our bodies can survive pregnancy, which is a massive energy demand on our system.

And there’s absolutely NO “treatment” for cellulite that will work. They are all bullshit designed to separate you from your hard-earned cash. It’s a secondary sex characteristic, it’s perfectly normal and it’s not going away no matter what you do. Like I’m very lean myself and I work out 5~6 times a week, and I still have cellulite. Someone giving a woman shit for having cellulite is akin to giving her shit for having skin. It’s just a mixture of misogyny and corporate greed.

9jk2fa,I was a sex worker for 5 years and 99.9% of my experiences were nothing like what pro-prostitution rallyers claim.,734,"Posting on a throwaway but I posted some of my experiences elsewhere a while ago and someone pm’d me to post here as well. 

So cutting to the chase, I was an escort from when I was 22 to 27. My life has been ruined in many ways due to my choices and I accept it and try to make the best of it, but I get so disgusted when I see people (mostly men) viciously defend prostitution on the internet based on that “one friend” they have who’s a prostitute and LOVES it. 

I was an escort and I started in university to get some extra cash like most dumb college aged girls. I had a ton of debt and my parents were no help. It’s the oldest story In the book but I met some women who were sugar babies claiming to make easy thousands and I got hooked. There’s nothing positive about sex work but if I could attribute just one word it’s that it’s just “easy” at first at least...

I was 22, barely out of college and I was desirable. Never listen to words coming out of an early twenties hooker because this is essentially their peak and they don’t even know it. I was shy, nervous, inexperienced (which are huge draws-no surprise) and after posting a few profiles I had a lot of offers. Some for only a few hundred a month but others for thousands and even more. I shopped around at first because I really thought this was like online dating in a way. You have choice and you get paid too. 

After a few “dates”which are really just negotiations I ended up with this older guy around the same age as my dad. He was probably the nicest and most accommodating client I’d ever had. We met a few times a month and despite what certain online “tell all’s”have said all sugar daddies expect sex. I have literally never heard of girls getting paid thousands for conversation.

When he ultimately ended the arrangement with me I was a full fledged sex worker. I mostly operated through word of mouth and a few low key postings but it wasn’t too difficult to find clients. I was still in a major college town and there was always business once my contact started getting passed around. HOWEVER what I can’t emphasise enough is how soul sucking the job actually is. It starts slow and you learn to desensitise yourself at first. You tell yourself most people are just prudes for stigmatising sex work. In fact, you tell yourself that you’re actually the smart one, because you were able to push through society’s regressive attitude and make yourself some serious bucks. If you’re not the cleverest entrepreneur then who is? 

Remind yourself of this logic when you encounter women or men who try so hard to justify sex work as empowering. They’re in denial. I know this because at a later point roughly all of my friends were fellow escorts. 99% of the escorts I met hated their jobs and made it no secret. But they had obligations- kids, dead beat husbands,debt, sick parents even. Most of them gave themselves timelines, this much time to work to save up this much money before they found a real job. It’s no surprise, because most johns are some of the most disgusting men you can imagine both physically and personality wise. Ask any retired sex worker about clients that have insulted them, physically tried unapproved acts against their will, or threatened them in any way for discounts and the honest ones will ask you where to start. The fantasy of the Richard Gere-esque “gentleman John” is fucking untrue and basically a kind of fanfic imagined by guilty men.

Well the remaining 1% tended to be the loudest advocates of prostitution while enduring the absolute worst. It’s like some kind of weird switch that goes off in their brains. These were the women that were abused pretty routinely by clients. These were the ones that accepted men who liked to degrade them because that was part of the “fantasy” of being with a prostitute. These were also the ones that tried to manage their hurt by completely turning it around and labelling it as empowerment. They were virulent internet defenders, making these really big proclamations of how glamourous their lives are, how much they earn, how much they pity regular women with their leaching families and minimum wage jobs. They are the often the ones spreading ideas that most male clients are sooo respectful because the woman is actually the one in power (can you believe it).

I wanted to post this because I’m sick to death of seeing this kind of pro-prostitution sentiment while insecure, entitled men quote delusions of deeply hurt women as justification for their continued abuse of sex workers. It is an objectively terrible, soul draining, isolating industry that chews up young women and change their lives for the worse. I’m angry at the women who defend it too, but i understand that most do it as a form of self-medication for their own traumas. It’s nice to hear people envy your life when you yourself hate it so deeply.",134,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9jk2fa/i_was_a_sex_worker_for_5_years_and_999_of_my/

9ivmby,"So, I've recently been called a ""misogynist conspiracy theorist"" by PornHub's community manager for decrying abusive porn and pointing out that most free porn sites are owned by their parent company, MindGeek. Wanna hear my take?",729,"Wanna hear something the porn industry doesn't want you to know? Notice how the front page of every porn site has material that would be considered incredibly disturbing even a few years ago? Simulated children, simulated incest, cuckolding. etc? Not to mention that it's now expected for people to watch porn of and lust after others while in ""committed"" relationships.

I've looked into it and found that the heart of the porn industry lies within a secretive company called MindGeek, whose main office is in Luxembourg, but has an office in LA. They're an ""influencing company"" ([https://www.mindgeek.com/](https://www.mindgeek.com/)) whose main goal seems to be to push certain types of content to the masses. Notice how their website doesn't actually say what they do and uses so much evasive language? Because they actively push certain content onto porn sites to try to influence the masses. And, by the way, they WANT minors watching it.

They own PornHub, Brazzers, XTube, and a whole lot of other familiar names. Porn stars get blacklisted from the industry when they even mention MindGeek.

All the posters have chalked this up to the TIM being “hormonal” and going through “second puberty.” Classic TRA stuff. This infuriates me because these stereotypes affect ALL WOMEN and contribute to the sexism every woman will face at work. But somehow we should give them a pass and cater to their emotional needs. If I was a teenager who had harmful beliefs or was acting in a way that was racist/homophobic etc. nobody would give me a pass. And they shouldn’t. But sexism is all right? Much less this TIM already being an adult. Sure, hormones may cause fluctuations in your emotions, but your BRAIN and reasoning skills are surely fully developed! 

When I went through puberty I only remember being occasionally rude to my parents and cranky. I didn’t turn into a giggly, dumb mess. Is this how a TIM thinks girls going through actual puberty act?

bmwl6b,John Mulaney is a terf,716,"John Mulaney is pretty popular right now, lots of young people seem to love him. I think he’s hilarious. In his older comedy sets, he has a bit on drag queens that is hilarious and insightful. Here’s the text:

“I have lots of drag queens around and I like to study them—and I mean, more of your high-end type of drag queens, not like your tenderloin drag queens. Who, I'm sorry, aren't even fucking trying. Like a lot of them just have a mop on their head and a skirt and are like, ""I'm a gal!"" You're not a gal. You're not a gal.

Really fancy drag queens are funny though, 'cause like a lot of drag queens, it's like they're under the impression that they're like, a celebrity. It's like they all have this attitude of like, ""Don't you know who I am? I'm Strawberry Alarm Clock."" It's like, ""No, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. It's just I don't hang out in the one bar where you get free drinks.""

I wanna say this though, I think it's fine if someone wants to be a drag queen, that's great, if you wanna like, express your inner woman. But why, with so many drag queens, is it always the same type of woman? Like, why is it always like, a big and brassy woman? With like, a beehive hairdo and alligator skin shoes? It's like, what is your notion of a woman based on? A housewife in a Far Side cartoon? Why is that what you think femininity is?

And then, some of these drag queens, they'll go out on the street, and they'll bully me. They will. They'll be like, ""Oh-hoh, look at him and his little shirt."" It's like, why are you mean? Why is that part of it for you? And it's not little, it's a medium. Small is little. You went through all the trouble to put on a nice dress, and now you're gonna be rude and bossy to people? It's like, do you know what your version of a lady is a lot like? A guy. You could've stayed a guy if you were gonna be an asshole about it.”

> We're excluding them because they're men.

> Even if they stopped identifying as transgender or stopped identifying as women they would still be excluded.

> The fact that they identify as trans has nothing to do with why they can't join a women's organisation.

> It's got everything to do with the fact that they're men. And women's organisations currently have the right to exclude men and this right is protected legally and celebrated socially.

A week later my little stalker took his pudgy Cheeto stained fingers to his keyboard and penned his best defence of the rights of men to invade women's spaces and appropriate feminism.

I hope he doesn't ever change. It's men like him (the men who have no subtly) who are the best at showing women that trans rights activism is nothing more than a branch of the men's rights movement and that the transgenders have sold them a bill of goods.

What I regret even more is how the trans community keeps so many things hidden from those looking into getting body modification surgeries as extreme as GRS!",705,"Trans woman here. SRS with dr McGinn ( who is a trans woman herself ) in 2014. 5,5 years post-op and I can tell you one thing: I absolutely regret this. The upkeep and maintenance, the urinary tract infections, the fact that it is shallow and can barely fit a penis for penetration, the fact that penetration isn’t even enjoyable because my vagina has no internal part of the clitoris, no mucosal walls, no ruggae. It’s just a flesh pocket that consistently needs to be dilated. When I forget a couple dilation sessions, it is just plain right painful to get my dilation schedule started up again. But the trans community brushed my concerns off as “nothing to worry about” or with bullshit like “all those horror stories on the internet were written by TERFs to scare you out of GRS” . Well, I better had chickened out. Not only have I dealt with long post-op depression, my genitals aren’t as sensitive as they used to be. I still prefer anal sex over fake vagina sex, simply because it’s a struggle to fit the penis comfortably into my neovagina and I barely feel anything from the penetration of the flesh pocket itself. Most feeling comes from stimulating the clitoris, which is what used to be part of my penis head. The clitoris isn’t as sensitive as my penis head used to be. It doesn’t even have all the nerve bundles that a natal clitoris comes with. I wish I could have saved myself this sorrow. Now for the rest of my transition: did it make me happy? It made my life significantly more difficult. I am stealth ( meaning that you keep your past hidden from others ) and I am terrified that people will find out and discover my past. I still have gender dysphoria. I feel like I live in a male body that was molded to look like a female body. My body doesn’t feel like a genuine female body. Finding a partner is almost impossible as a trans woman, even in my case and I pass well as a female. Even if you find a partner, you always feel inadequate because you put them through a lot more struggle than they should have to go through, by being with a trans person. My story is fairly typical for the average MtF. Most keep all kinds of unresolved psychiatric problems, the distress always stays present and there is a general unhappiness in the community. Yet, transitioning is still positioned as a holy grail. Well, it’s not. I wish there would have been other ways to deal with the dysphoria. My health is also worse since I have been on hormones for a long period of time. My eye sight is significantly worse than before HRT, I have anxiety and I have a very slow metabolism. The trans community silences everyone who dares to speak up against the narrative of happy-ever-after. Telling us we never have been real trans and so on. To this day I live as a woman and I absolutely regret living a transgender existence. I’m male and nothing in the world can change that. The community needs to start to tell the truth and not try to erase the bad and the ugly that comes with this transition. I have bladder discomfort and urinary tract infections very regularly since I had GRS 5,5 years ago with dr McGinn. My surgery was considered a success. I wonder how bad the less successful cases are wrecked when I am considered a success story in this physical situation. Things need to change.

You want to be called a he/she/they/whatever? Fine. What do I care? It doesn't impact or bother me. However, despite being part of these communities years ago (FB friends), I found myself cringing while I lurked on their posts and double-speak logic. Overall, their ideology confuses the fuck out of me and makes zero sense. 

&#x200B;

If gender is meaningless, and biological sex has nothing to do with gender stereotypes/norms/conformity, then why does being transgender even *exist*. Right? Like if you don't think women must wear dresses, or men must be masculine, then why the fuck should anyone need to feel like the opposite gender? Isn't this sort of an oxymoron? There was a person I knew who was a female, dressed feminine (dresses, makeup, etc) who then would flip out if someone assumed they had feminine pronouns. Anyone else getting whiplash from the confusion?

&#x200B;

Here's something I wonder. Lets say in 2050, suddenly, men can wear dresses and women can have short hair and work on cars, and it means nothing to society. ""Masculine"" traits aren't associated with men/penises, and ""feminine"" traits aren't associated with women/vaginas. None of this stuff holds any weight over biological sex or sexuality. Straight men can wear makeup if they want and no one would ever wonder whether they're a woman or gay or not. Lets say there are no norms, styles, or behaviors attached to biological sex, and people are either XX or XY, and that's it - no pressure to behave  or dress a certain way. Would there be people who are trans? I don't think so. There'd just be people with dicks who like football, or makeup, or cooking, or neither. Same for people with vaginas.

So, given that there's such an insane gap between the sexes re: criminal behavior, namely *violent* criminal behavior, it really frustrates me when male crimes (committed by TIMs) are reported as 'female'. r/thisneverhappens has a ton of examples of this new plague. 

The *statistical conflation of criminal behavior between the sexes* is *not* a gap that handmaidens should laud as ~progressive~ to 'fix'. It's just dragging actual women down in the shittiest of ways.

On a related note, I keep seeing studies of women's opinions where men (TIMs) were also answering as 'women'. This is wrong for a number of reasons. Men shouldn't be speaking as women on anything-- as trans'women', fine, but not as actual women. This ~progressive~ movement is slowly driving actual women out of their careers, out of their own politics, out of having their own voices in general.

I have a lot more to say on the topic, but I'll keep it short. Self-identification-driven conflation of the sexes is a slow but brutal erasure of women.

I was assigned female at birth and have female genitalia, got my chromosomes tested (XX), and I had eggs at one point. I'm a biological female who has a rare condition, it's really not the same as being a agp pornsick man who thinks his penis is feminine.

blgfrv,I got my academic department to add “sex” as a protected characteristic in addition to all the gender language,672,"It’s a little victory, but it means a lot to me.

They were drafting a conduct code to deal with potential sexual harassment issues, but the only protected categories were “gender identity” and “gender expression.” (I’m pretty sure they just used that language because it’s what the university’s diversity office recommended.) I politely suggested they also add “sex,” since not everyone knows how they identify, but we all have a sex and can be harrassed for it regardless of our identity.

The final draft now includes “sex” on the list of characteristics. I’m very pleased. Don’t be afraid to speak out. Genderists won’t go to bat for us and will happily leave “sex” off the list (or worse, throw us under the bus by forceably removing it when it was there in the past)—it’s up to us to speak up for ourselves and not fall asleep at the wheel as our protections are being removed.",40,gender identity,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/blgfrv/i_got_my_academic_department_to_add_sex_as_a/
bjo9b9,[RANT] A TIM shows up at an introduction course I gave yesterday morning to newly expecting mothers. I’m a nurse and I give newly expecting mothers tips for their soon to be new borns. I do this voluntarily. The TIM messed up everything.,674,"I do these sessions for newly expecting mothers thrice a year.
I’m a nurse. I have worked on several units over the years but have been working on neonatology for the last 5. There is this TIM who show up at an info session for pregnant women yesterday morning.
He wanted to know what it was like to be pregnant and soon to be expecting. He made all women very uncomfortable with his presence. We stayed polite because obviously making a scene wasn’t going to improve anything but he still managed to mess up my entire session.

When I showed the soon to be expecting new mums how to bathe their new borns, by help of a doll they each got, the TIM started mansplaining to the other participants how they had to do it right.

When I was showing them how to change diapers correctly, he started whining about his dysphoria and how we exacerbated his pregnancy dysphoria because he can’t carry his own baby.

I really had to grit my teeth sometimes, so that I would not lose my patience.

At one point he touches a woman’s belly ( this woman was calculated for the end of May ) without her permission, just because she told a woman next to her ( also due for late May ) to feel at her belly.

Honestly, I’m starting to loose my patience.
I can’t give sessions with this mindset.

I am thinking about giving the sessions privately at my house and only by invitation.

bcgw69,New data confirms that muscle size and strength is NOT reduced in transwomen after 1 year of “castration levels of testosterone” and estrogen treatment.,651,"Fair Play for Women posted [this abstract](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D35rcyCXoAEC_Va.png:large) from a poster presented yesterday at the EPATH conference, confirming what anyone with eyes and a brain already knows: allowing men to compete against women is fundamentally unfair. 

> Methods: 
Twelve transgender individuals, 6 trans women and 6 trans men who had been accepted to start gender-affirming medical intervention, were recruited. Knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry at three different angular velocities (0, 60 and 90 °/s). The assessments were made at four time points: (T1) before treatment initiation, (T2) four weeks after initiated gonadal hormonal down regulation but before hormone replacement, (T3) three months after hormone replacement therapy and (T4) eleven months after hormone replacement therapy. The cross-sectional area and radiological density of the thigh muscles were assessed by CT scans performed bilaterally at the midpoint of femur of each subject at baseline and after 11 months of cross-sex hormone treatment.

> Results and Conclusions: 
**Muscle area increased 17% in trans men** (p<0.001) with an 8% increase in radiology density after eleven month of cross-sex hormone treatment. **No change was seen in trans women.** There were significant (P<0.05) group x time interactions at each angular velocity. Thus, **while the trans men increased their strength over the four time points, strength levels were generally maintained in the trans women.** When averaging the three strength tests, knee extension (16%) and knee flexion (34%) strength increased from T1 to T4 in trans men. The corresponding changes in the trans women group were -6% and 0%, respectively. 

>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ~1 year of cross-sex hormone treatment results in increased muscle strength in trans men. Cross-sectional area and radiological density is also increased after testosterone treatment. However,** trans women maintain their strength levels as well as cross-sectional area and radiological density throughout the treatment period.** We conclude that the altered sex hormone pattern induced by gender-affirming treatment differentially affect muscle strength in trans men vs. trans women.",76,transwomen,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/bcgw69/new_data_confirms_that_muscle_size_and_strength/
cqp8um,Thank you for giving me the language I needed,652,"A few weeks ago my teenage daughter and I were having a talk. She's been trying to figure out her own sexuality for a while.

While we were talking, she said to me ""sometimes I don't feel like a girl - maybe I'm a boy"". 

I said to her ""What does feeling like a girl feel like? What does feeling like a boy feel like?""

She told me that she didn't know, she loves her body, her curves, but she hates her period and she doesn't really relate to most of the girls in her class. 

I explained to her that sex is real, and gender roles are a construct forced on us from the time we are babies. 

That she's a girl, which means that she a female reproductive system, which is awesome, and that yeah, periods can suck, and so can other things which comes with being a girl/woman, but beyond that, most of the differences between boys and girls are the way we've been raised.

cgti4w,It's because we're women.,636,"I was just having a chat with my partner. He was asking if I knew that GC had been branded a hate sub.  I asked him why he thought that was and he said because of our views on trans women (that they aren't women). I reminded him that the bulk of humanity holds those same views, so why does our holding them constitute hate?

It's because we're women. 

Ricky Gervais has spoken out against JY on Twitter. He has vocal supporters defending him against accusations of transphobia. Meanwhile, Megan Murphy has been banned from Twitter for speaking out against JY. Most of the rest of us are too afraid to speak out, for fear of losing our jobs or facing violence against ourselves and our family. Why can't we speak out as freely?

It's because we're women. 

The thing that really gets me is that women are the people actually affected by all this. From the outside, it might look like we're obsessed. But we're the ones losing access to the sports we worked so hard to have. We're the ones being called bigots for not wanting to see penises in our locker rooms. We're the ones being manhandled between a rock and a cotton ceiling. We're the ones losing our jobs for trying to protect children. We're the ones being told womanhood -- our very existence -- is defined by sexist stereotypes instead of shared biology. 

It's because we're women. 

Women (but only ""cis"" women, for some reason) are expected to accommodate, to make everybody else feel better. And this particular group of women is now saying no to that this time around. No violence. No threats. No bullying. Just no blind acceptance and capitulation. Apparently that's hate?

bc19dv,Siiiiigh... Reddit lynch mob against female scientist from the blackhole research (rant),630,"Been despairing today at the backlash on Reddit against Dr Katie Bouman. Her photos have been hitting the front page multiple times because she's personable, attractive, played a central role to the exciting research, and *gasp* a female in STEM.

Cue the misogynists.

If you haven't seen the cesspools of comments then the main arguments are:

1. She's taking away from the **real** researchers in her group that did all the work
2. The media only pays attention to hot women -- female privilege!!!
3. It's attention seeking behaviour and she's looking to personally benefit.
4. She's lying and exaggerating her importance in the group -- she's only a minor player but calling herself the leader of the entire blackhole project

The ""evidence"" for (1) comes from some super smort Reddit sleuths who found her group's GitHub and have compared her code contribution versus the men in her team. A man has uploaded more than 4x the lines of code she has, absolute scandal! This poor man is being side lined for a lazy, second-rate researcher! Where's his TV slot?

I'm a scientist and a woman and this reaction really enrages and sickens me for so many reasons. I've done work with media people and outreach and this situation is horrible. I had to rant somewhere.

Firstly, the journalists are to blame for misinformation. When she gets inevitably doxxed I hope she calls them out on this. In all her interviews she is very clearly stating her place within a team and that her team is one of many. She did invent the very algorithm that creates the image and she is a team leader, but not the entire head of the project. The journalists keep captioning her as ""leader"" which is misinterpreted by others sharing the images. There's an obsession for journalists to find the head genius in any big science story and it drives scientists barmy:

&#x200B;

[""The woman behind...""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47891902) (One woman of many!) 

&#x200B;

[""The brilliant mind who....""](https://interestingengineering.com/katie-bouman-the-brilliant-mind-that-brought-us-the-image-of-a-black-hole) (One brilliant mind of many!) 

&#x200B;

[""Thank this grad student for the black hole image....""](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/katie-bouman-mit-black-hole-algorithm-sci-trnd/index.html) (Argh she's an assistant professor!!!!)

&#x200B;

These huge projects are team efforts first and foremost. The official head of the project (Dr Heino Falcke) probably barely saw any of the code or even knows how it really works. But that's okay! Everyone contributes or you don't get authorship.

Secondly, the journalists know the public prefer to have a human perspective on a heavy scientific discovery. The black hole image is... Well, faceless so there is a frenzy to find something relatable amongst the equations and data. Dr Bouman is a gift to these journalists. In the world of scientific computing for radio satellites, she is young and pretty and witty in interviews. You'd think her PhD from MIT would be enough but remember it's how hot a woman is first and foremost. The public won't listen to female scientists unless they have sex appeal.

She had taken her own photos throughout the work, including ""the moment"" it all came together. She has experience giving a TED talk. The media storm around her is inevitable because the alternatives are frankly uninspiring on camera.

Angry Reddit misogynists have interpreted her outreach work as self-serving and I am truly dumbfounded. A person who wants to be internet famous and a celebrity does not get a PhD in imaging via physical model inversion.

To say scientists avoid media work like the plague is an understatement. My colleague's paper did well in the media and she locked herself in her office and cried at the prospect of being interviewed and photographed. My male colleagues are similar, and many scientists who know there will be a storm around their paper often flee abroad to avoid it entirely.

However, for many female scientists there is a sense of moral duty to do outreach work and try to engage with the public. Many of us had few role models and we are thinking of the young girls who need inspiration in a world that tells them they can't do maths. It's trying to give back, make things a bit better. In addition some of us truly enjoy our field and want to share it with others. When I see Dr Bouman's social media and talks it's the same vibe. She's not trying to be an Instagram influencer or get on Oprah.

I think most women don't enjoy being the token female scientist. I hate it when random people praise me for just working in a scientific field.  **This shouldn't be remarkable**. Getting media attention like this can feel like you're being pointed out as an anomaly rather discussing your contributions. So yes, women get media attention but it's hardly a privilege. It mostly feels like ""look at this female creature using her brain! Extraordinary!"" And again, first and foremost media cares about your sex appeal.

And finally as a computational scientist the GitHub sleuthing really got to me. The dude with 800k lines of ""code"" was mostly uploading lines of data, aka dogsbody work. Scientific programming is NOT software development. Dr Bouman's algorithm might be 10 lines long but it's the foundation and therefore a massive contribution to her team's work.

I'm sad and angry that everyone starts picking apart female scientists for taking too much credit, meanwhile Elon Musk is eternally worshipped online for ""inventing rockets"" and ""he'll take us to Mars"" like his engineers don't exist.

in hs i was raped by someone who i thought was a close friend. it’s been about three years. i had a substance abuse problem, specifically with benzos, and they took advantage of that. they sent me a text the next day apologizing and telling me what had happened. i kept the texts and got a drug test administered just in case. word got out about what happened, and i was hit with a cease and desist letter for slander from their lawyer telling me to stop engaging in my “slanderous behavior”. i come from a poor family, and even with the overwhelming evidence i had that i wasn’t lying, didn’t have the energy or finances to defend myself

many people know about it but i stopped talking about it. last night i had to drive past their house to get to another friends, and the person i was with brought my rapist up and gave me a detailed update on their life, down to how many people were donating to their gofundme for surgery to transition. she wanted to “let me know about their new pronouns just in case i ever had to talk about them again” so that i wouldn’t misgender my rapist, because “even though they’re a piece of shit, we’re still going to be respectful” 

i feel really gross. why the fuck would you bring that up... i haven’t checked up on my rapist since I got that cease and desist. she really gave me a detailed update on a rapists life to make sure that i would use correct pronouns if it ever came up for me to talk about the time i was raped. ive spent three years trying to move on from this. my rapist has over $1000 on gofundme for gender reassignment surgery and im supposed to recall what happened to me in order to be respectful to a rapist, not myself. 

im sorry if this isn’t worded well, i just wanted to tell someone because if i tell any of my friends they’ll probably get mad at me for being transphobic. i don’t know if this is the right place to go. i generally don’t really care about identity politics. i just feel hurt that people care so much about their feelings that they’re willing to tell a rape victim to have some respect for their pronouns.

My sister then asked her why she felt the need to threaten and insult me and she replied that “TERFs are bottom feeding scum” or something of the sort, Whatever that means, I’m certainly not a bottom feeder in any sense. She then blocked her too. Of course.

She called me transphobic a few months ago, and so I explained how the word transphobia is thrown around to oppress women. I don’t give a stuff how a woman interprets femininity or how a man interprets masculinity, but their inherent sex cannot change and will never change.

So I live in Hollywood, I guess you could call me a casual filmmaker and am lucky to live around a lot of similarly creative people in their 20s, 30s who create for the sake of creating. Filmmaking is expensive business. Consequently, a lot of us end up doing favors for one another, and when my friend asked me to be in an experimental film about femicide of course I said yes. I got up at 6am on a Sunday and made my way to the pickup where she'd be waiting to collect me and a group of her friends who were also volunteering. I get there and there are two women and a 6ft, broad, balding white guy. I assume he's crew and since my friend is running late, I make small talk. The first thing this guy tells me about himself?

&#x200B;

\> ""I look really broey but I'm actually non binary""

&#x200B;

Ugh. Really? I immediately see where this is going. I've never heard a gay or lesbian person immediately state their sexuality or gender or whatever with absolutely no prompting so I'm already not feeling optimistic about how the rest of this day is going to go. The whole ride to the set I try and steer clear of any woketalk and we talk about industry stuff instead. We get into our costumes and he seems utterly delighted when he's given a sheer pink shirt and a tight midlength skirt. There are a handful of other women there and one or two purr patronizingly at the stunning brave man in a skirt. When filming begins he starts in on the gender thing again, and I notice the director keeps positioning him in the middle of scene, so he's the focus. Again, it's her project so no arguments from me, but I can't imagine why such an obvious man would be included in this project. I decide to just put it out there.

&#x200B;

'Yeah, I'm actually gender critical and don't believe in gender at all.'

&#x200B;

He whips his head back so hard that the director has to come and reposition. He asks me to explain and I do, and I can see it turning it over his mind. I tell him that literally everyone is 'non binary' and that no one can opt in or out of oppression. 

&#x200B;

""That's definitely a perspective I've never heard before...""

&#x200B;

But then he recycles every bit of propaganda he's heard to make himself feel special. How it's an internal feeling, how third genders have existed for thousands of years yadda yadda. I try and explain that you are yourself and it seems more sexist to reinforce the idea that if, as he said, you don't feel like 'one of the guys' then you must simply not be one, despite appearing to everyone as a well built white male. He told me how he hardly ever tells anyone about his 'identity' but that his pronouns were important, and I told him it seemed very narcissistic to make everyone around you bend their language in a way that doesn't make sense just to satisfy yourself. I could see him squirming, and grasping for compliments like his qweer friends undoubtedly shower him with, he asks me what I think about his dress. I tell him I don't like it, and he asks if it was the color. 

&#x200B;

""No, actually it's so tight I can see the outline of your penis.""

&#x200B;

Silence.

&#x200B;

We had lunch later and his wife seemed extremely short with him. I wondered if she was sick of him. I was. And I felt sorry for him. I got the sense that he was a confused bisexual who was actually pretty boring and only had his 'identity' to make him more interesting, consequently making him even more dull. He was extremely self absorbed and his handmaidens were just fueling it. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, it finally happened.

It goes without question that drug use is rife in the porn industry. And her usage has thoroughly destroyed her life. Not only that, look how she cringes when she’s asked her age. She knows she is no longer needed by the industry because of her age. 

She probably feels that there are no jobs open to her because instead of gaining a good education for long term job aspirations she turned to focus on pornography, which has obviously damaged her mental health and disposed of her at her darkest times.

Why are people still promoting this? It’s honestly so disgusting, these women, Even the most ‘successful’  ones are vulnerable.

c6j2lf,I feel like I've been screwed over. (Former FTM),591,"Hi, I will give a quick run down of my story because I just really need to rant somewhere. 

I'm 23 years old, female (luckily) and from the US. 
 
I've always been a tomboy but still kind of ""feminine"" in how I presented myself, at least until I got into college at 18, it was a pretty liberal college so I got into contact with some new ideas for me because I'm from a quite conservative/republican family. 

Being the impressionable young girl that I was I quickly got into the feminist mindset common on the campus, which maybe wasn't a totally bad thing but then something else happened and I really learned about transgenderism. 

Now for me as somebody who has been always kind of uncomfortable in my own body with ""typically male interests"", this felt like the obvious solution. 

My college offered a therapist everybody could talk to for a short time once a month, so I talked to him and he was immediately on board with the idea of me being transgender and suggested that I should visit a ""specialist"". 

Which is what I did, she immediately started suggesting that I should transition even without really talking too much about it, so I did. 

After a month or so I came out as trans, my environment in the college was super accepting and even ""praised"" me for being ""so brave"". 

On the other hand, it  quickly destroyed my relationship with my parents, but at the time I felt like they were just stupid and tried to force me into traditional gender roles. 

I started living as a male fulltime and I got a breast removal at 20, which is still one of my biggest regrets. Now luckily for now, probably thanks to my relatively intensive workout routines at the time, I passed pretty well  without taking T, which I only started about a month before my breakdown which got me out of this mess.

At 22 I graduated from college and got into my first job, I work in software development. 

With this job I got into a pretty close relationship with a co-worker which I would describe as a good guy friendship, at least from his side. 

But for me in my head it started being more and more, I got romantically involved, at least in my head, but none of the thoughts in my head really matched who I thought I was. 

In every little day dream I had I was a woman, I thought about having a family with him and everything. You could say that I gota bit crazy. 

Now I've to add that I thought that I was into women until this point. 

To suppress the thoughts above, I started taking T about 2 month ago which kind of pushed me above the edge. 

I've realized how massively I've fucked up and I only feel massive regret. 

I'm lonely, have mutilated my own body and I can't even describe how terrible I feel.

co1n5a,"Most men are unable to consider their thoughts and emotions objectively. If it’s in his head, it must be true",590,"(English is not my mother tongue, sorry for errors) 
I work as a therapist. A major thing I learned in training is the importance of mentalization (similar to theory of mind) for mental health. Mentalization is a term for the mental capacities that enables us to understand ourselves and others, have empathy , plan ahead and control our emotions and emotional expression. Increasing mentalization is a major goal in therapy as it is like strengthening the necessary muscles required to handle challenges and symptoms.
Mentalization requires you to objectively consider the truthfulness and validity of your thoughts and emotions. This is important as it enables you not to act impulsively and not maintain anxiety and depression which is often /always based on unhelpful feelings and appraisals. 

When you consider non clinical populations it just strikes me how this seems to come more naturally for women. We are especially taught  to examine the validity of our emotions from an early age. “Are you sure your not overreacting?”  “ He didn’t mean it like that” “are you pms’ing again?”. This in turn creates a lot of girls and women who becomes hypercritical of her own emotions and reactions while at the same time hyper-mentalizing others (especially men’s) intentions. She second guesses herself and tries desperately to make sense of why the men in her life treats her the way they do, giving benefit of the doubt and looking within herself to find the answers to their behavior.

Male socialization on the other hand deals much differently with these issues. The broad cultural message given to boys from our sexist society is that he is the protagonist of his own story, he must always be logic and rational, as long as he considers issues with thoughts and cognition and not emotions he will always be logical and right, and as he is always logical, his emotional experiences are always valid as they result from what he perceives as his logical beliefs.

I believe differences like these can help explain why men seem so unable to empathize with and understand women’s experiences. We see all the time here on reddit how men are unable to even respect that a woman may perceive situations differently than they do. This is most extreme in the manosphere of course, where men boast about how they don’t see women as humans. But, I believe mentalization capabilities  plays a part in leading these men to the manosphere. 

Consider the anger of nice guys and incels who believe they have been mislead about what a woman wants in a man. Boy is told by his mom that he needs to be nice and considerate to get a date. This makes sense to boy, so he now believes it. Boy is unable to get a date. Boy becomes angry. Instead of analyzing the theory he has in his head, like, idk take an honest look at both his social skills and whether he might have oversimplified the theory, he feels angry. As he is angry, and unable to assess this anger rationally, the resulting conclusion is that he has been wronged. This feels true, so it must be. The interplay between the emotion (anger) and thought applied to it (I have been wronged) becomes a never ending loop he is unable to escape, as he has little training in assessing cognitions rationally. 

This is dragging on so ill close with one last example. Men refusing to believe that women have our own set of problems in sex and dating. Because men believe that a woman can always have sex, she is privileged and lives life on easy mode. The man wants sex more than anything, therefore sex is truly the key to happiness and women have nothing to complain about. Even though he claims to understand evo-psych (these men loooove the bio-truths that validates their toxic masculinity), he cannot fathom how women find being pumped and dumped upsetting, as he himself would love to be ‘used for his body’. This feels true, so it must be. As a logical male, the conclusion is that women are so spoilt and irrational they are completely unable to see how good they have it and the logical explanation for a woman’s dating woes is always due to her hypergamous nature. Never mind the fact that studies have shown that men are actually incapable of even noticing unattractive women (another thing he’ll never know due to his mentalization deficits)

caqrzw,I'm a therapist who works in cosmetic surgery and wanted to share some thoughts,585,"I've been a therapist (""psychotherapist"") for 20 years, and working as a consultant for cosmetic surgeons for the past 10 years. I am a woman and a feminist, I'm not sure I'd call myself a radical feminist for various ideological reasons but I am certainly not a fan of popular feminism and I agree with the majority stance of this sub.    

I wanted to share some of my experiences and thoughts with you just because I thought some readers might find them interesting and they could be a useful insight.    
The vast majority of patients I work with are having simple procedures and there is A LOT i could say about that but it seems very obvious to me. I don't think I need to tell you all about the motivations behind wanting to look ""perfect"". I did want to share a little bit about my insight into trans procedures so I'll just type that out and take it as you will...    

I started working in cosmetics because of an experience with one patient. She had an eating disorder and had had breast implants. Her old therapist gave me her notes before I started seeing her. From them it seemed like she had got the implants for 2 reasons:    

1. She had experienced sexual abuse in her early teens. Now, seeing her 'flat' chest made her still feel like a child and constantly triggered traumatic memories. She also worried that any partner she had must fetishise her breasts for looking pre-pubsecent and felt re-victimised by that.    

2. She was concerned by the prevailing western image of what an attractive woman is. Her eating disorder started as a teen and meant she did not develop breasts, but her pelvis did widen, and as an adult she felt 'out of proportion' because of this.    

The second issue was easy to contend with for obvious reasons that I won't bother explaining in this sub.    

The first issue is complex and I was interested to get to know her and help her. She had come to me because her previous therapist was supportive of her getting implants, but then she regretted them, and she wanted to see a new therapist after that.    

Some of her issues were: don't like feeling foreign objects inside my body, my back hurts, bras are uncomfortable, unwanted sexual attention, scars.    

My initial stance was to let her know that these are problems women with natural breast feel too, that it wasn't specific to her surgery. We also discussed the difficulty with 'foreign objects', that is a known issue and something therapist will spend time on with patients who need implanted devices for medical reasons.    

The longer we worked together the more I realised that her attempts to fix her psychological issues by altering her body were numerous and ineffective. Initially I had thought that the surgery could - although maybe not the best route- help with her childhood sexual trauma. But then I learnt of her many other ways of altering her appearance, always in the hope that something would change. and i realised she was desperate for a physical change to be able to change her mental state.    

this had started before her sexual abuse and once we found the root cause we were able to work on it, and she understood why it wasn't helpful, why it hadn't helped initially and why it would never help with her trauma.     

she ended up getting her implants removed and we stopped working together after nearly 3 years, with her being in a very good place.
this inspired me to work in cosmetics.    

here all cosmetic surgery patients must see a therapist. its about money and the law, medical staff can't have patients saying they weren't in their right mind and demanding reparations. but i actually wanted to make a positive difference.     

so i've been working in this area for the past 5-6 years, and have seen many trans patients in that time.     

the rise in the number of these patients has caused a great amount of discussion and i joined a group of therapists in this area who discuss their experiences and analysis of what's going on.
i'll share my experience here     

i don't work in a specific gender clinic so are that in mind, these are my experiences at a private cosmetic surgery.    

male wanting to be female patients: overwhelmingly come in for breast implants. usually no real desire to 'live as a woman' but very motivated by sexual pleasure of breasts. they have intense and distracting fantasies about 'being a woman' during sex- this means they want a man to have sex with them as if they were a woman (but anal sex ofc). They also enjoy the idea of masturbating whilst touching the breasts they want to have, and of sexual encounters where a man or woman fondles these breasts.     

In these cases I usual requests further sessions on the basis that their desire is sexually-motivated and may cause dissatisfaction in the rest of their lives. usually, after a few sessions, patients desist in their desire for the procedure. we talk about their motivations and how making decisions that impact your whole life off of sexual desire can be damaging and unhelpful. sometimes there's a need to talk about past trauma but overwhelmingly there is no trauma. also overwhelmingly there is a high instance of porn use and specifically lesbian porn with sado-masochistic elements. my analysis, in 99% of these patients, is unfulfilled sexual desire leading to porn use,  leading to distorted views of sexuality.    

female wanting to be male: i have never seen a patient in this situation who did not experience some type of childhood sexual abuse. Perhaps that is statistically likely given how common an experience this is for women. But in 10 years to never have a patient who wasn't abused by a man as a child/adolescent is significant in my opinion. Overwhelmingly the desire is to appear more masculine to evade abuse and gain acceptance, sometimes dominance. In my sessions discussion would always come back to their belief that men have better lives, more opportunities, less to fear. They frequently stated that they would not have been abused if they were male. They also often had eating disorders (mostly starvation, sometimes over-eating to obesity) related to how they felt there bodies may have invited abuse. I would of course explain that the of their abuse was their abuser, not anything they did or how they looked. Often, maybe 75%, patients are lesbians who feel they would be more attractive to women by presenting 'as a man', and this was usually concurrent with being raised in a culture with stigmatism against homosexuality. The procedures offered in the area I work in include facial surgery, implants, sculpting liposuction. Not genital surgery so it wasn't often discussed so i won't comment as it would just be isolated cases.     

That's all I have for now

I want to make this post here because i got yelled at in my twitter but somebody said to make it here so nobody knows who i am. 

I participate in a gay club in my school, it's where i met all my friends. In this club we discuss lgbt problems, culture and we try to do charity or something and most of the members are LGBT there are only two allies. A trans girl joined us two months ago, she takes hormones and she wears dresses and paints her nails and has changed her name but she still looks like a boy. I used to wear a lot of makeup because i felt bad about my face (i dont anymore!) and she became my friend because she wanted me to teach her how to put makeup on and be a girl and i said yes. But then she started being really weird like she would ask about my period and my breasts or my body in a weird way and i didn't know why she was asking those questions because we didn't have the same body she doesn't get a periodd. She would also talk about her genitals a lot and it was gross because i hate penis. I stopped being her friend and stopped talking to her for a while. 

Last week she sent me a message to ask me to be her girlfriend but i said no because un)- i didn't like her and two)- the message was very weird she was talking about kissing me and stuff and she's seventeen! she's very older than me. After i said no she kept asking if it is because she was trans but i didn't answer her. She made a report about me to the club and they said i have to apologize but i said no and now they say i can't be in the club because i make trans friends feel weird.

b94r7m,This REALLY needs to be an international scandal. Now.,577,"I've tried a million times to post this but it keeps getting auto-removed. I understand the reasons why but so far it's worked in the interest of TRAs, not women. Or children, for that matter. I removed all links but it turns out that even mentioning the names of the sources is unacceptable. More on that in a minute.

Dr. Wallace Wong, of Sandcastles, runs a clinic in British Colombia for ""trans"" kids. He has speaking tours and books that supplement his income. He has six doctors under him. Of his clients, 501 of them are children in foster care. That's about 10-20% of children in foster care in BC. Why the hell one gender quack is the only man who can help 501 children for a previously unheard of disorder should be red flag #1. Of these 7 doctors, just the ministry children alone would mean about 71 children per doctor. The average psychologist sees 25 patients a week, which means they can't possibly be seeing these children on a frequent basis.

There are several issues with Dr. Wallace Wong. He's been recorded saying that his youngest client is not even three years old. He's also been recorded instructing parents to pull the suicide card if the department does not immediately agree to puberty blockers and cross hormones.

501 foster care children are about to have their fertility and health destroyed with no one to defend them. One client not in foster care was court ordered to receive hormones against her father's wishes. 

This is Catholic Church level abuse. It is a scam, a racket, and should involve not just license stripping but JAIL TIME.

I'm not linking to the news stories because only the conservative media is reporting this. I understand why we don't want to give them clicks, but for me, it just made GC communication and awareness more difficult, more policed, and worked to the benefit of TRAs, and no one else. Their facts came from Dr. Wong's own public statements at the Vancouver Public Library. Since progressive media has pretty much abandoned us for the sake of wealthy AGPs we may have to plug our noses and get our information where we can, while we build up our own outlets. (That get banned).

He's already shut down his personal website for speaking tours and books, but his clinic is still up and open for new clients. 

Canadian citizens really, really need to seek transparency for how their foster care system functions, and how quacks are able to acquire tax money. They have a right to know what safeguards are missing. I really, really don't want to be asleep at the wheel and pay more attention to makeup names than mostly foster girls being sterilized and pumped with testosterone.",105,agps,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/b94r7m/this_really_needs_to_be_an_international_scandal/

b5wr9i,"Jameela Jamil tweets about sexual harassment, TRAs respond with, “Not every woman has a vagina!”",569,"Part of the tweet (which is still up, if you want to check it out) read, “Let this be an education to everyone out there about our experience as the disrespected/disregarded gender. I’m so sorry to you all for what you’ve been put through for daring to govern your own vagina.”

Of course, more than a few TRAs had to comment, “💕Not every woman has a vagina!💕” What was refreshing was to see how many people were fighting back! 

“The majority of women do have vaginas, though, and we get harassed because of it.”

“This ‘not all women have vaginas’ thing is the new ‘not all men’.”

“Christ. Leave her alone. She's speaking about her experience of womanhood and does not require your ‘not all men’ing.”

“Enjoying how that's not remotely relevant to the point Jameela was making but you couldn't resist an opportunity to tell a woman off for saying vagina.”

“But women do have vaginas.  And you should respect that they have the right to name their body parts.  It is pretty sad for you to say this to us.”

“Always ready to jump in and correct a female! How lovely. All women have vaginas. All people with vaginas are women are girls. We can’t identify out of oppression that happens because of our sex.”

“STOP TRYING TO SHUT US UP! we need space to discuss this shit and you being the women/vagina police isn't fucking helpful. YOU ARE ENABLING THE PERPETRATORS OF THE VIOLENCE.”

“Go find another thread to bother.”

My favorite interaction was between a TRA who said, “I hope you didn’t mean to be exclusionary to trans women. We have our own set of issues and various genitalia (even some cis, non-binary, and intersex women do too) that we’re not all as willing to give into a terrifying man’s advances,” and someone who replied, “As you say ‘your own set of issues’. Guess what? Women do too! Stick to your own lane.”

I saw replies from GC Twitter, but it seems like more people are hitting peak trans. Still. It SUCKS when we women try to have a discussion about real shit that’s going on, or we try to tell our own stories about the harassment we face because of our sex and TRAs complain that we aren’t being inclusive.",87,trans women,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/b5wr9i/jameela_jamil_tweets_about_sexual_harassment_tras/
bmrtmn,My now EX- Trans partner. Update!,574,"I want to once again thank everyone for all their love and support. I can’t adequately put into words how much it’s meant to me. I was told such terrible things about this community, but all I’ve actually found are women who’ve put their politics aside to help a girl in trouble. You’re genuinely wonderful, compassionate people, and I’ll always be thankful and indebted to you all for that. I’m still working my way to replying to all the comments but I definitely will! 

Yesterday I told my best friend who I’m staying with, let’s call her Grace, absolutely everything and we had a cuddle and a cry. I held everything in for so long for a myriad of reasons, and coming out with the truth, not cloaked with any rhetoric, to someone who I know loves me and is on my side was so wonderful. 

Today I got my girls together, a good seven of us, and we went to my ex-partner’s apartment and cleared all my stuff out. My friend borrowed her mum’s Land Rover so everything nicely fit. 

The advice and support you all gave me was honestly priceless. I waited until they were at work, I’ve cut contact and I’ve called the bank to sort out separating our accounts. They’re actually quite rich, old money, trust fund- you know the type, so honestly I don’t think they’d bother taking anything from me. They work in canary wharf whilst I stupidly went into art as a career. But I thought better safe than sorry. Since I haven’t answered any of their messages or calls they’ve become insistent. I’ve changed their number to “do not answer,” as someone wonderfully recommended just in case I need evidence, but I don’t think I’ve got enough self control to stop myself from reading their messages so I might have to block them for my own sanity. One of them read “I’m sorry I was a bit rough the other day” and I stopped there. 

I know you all mentioned just the essentials, but I don’t want to see them for a very long time or send my friends there so I cleared *everything.* My clothes, my shoes, my make up, my bedsheets, my art, my books, my hoover, my picture frames, my pots and pans and mugs. Of course my cat. I don’t think they would, but the reply on the last post warning me that they might hurt her really frightened me and I didn’t want to leave her there for another second. I took absolutely everything. As I moved in, I didn’t bring much furniture and what I owned honestly looked tatty in comparison but I did take my rug and my dressing table which was easy enough to dismantle. My friends wanted to take everything from the fridge which made me laugh. I managed to stop them, but they did take all the expensive items. We had an evening of fancy from- France camembert and delicate, pretty looking pastries that I don’t know the names of. 

I know there were mixed responses about how I should break up, especially about leaving a letter, but the thought of seeing them in the flesh frightens me to no end so that ruled out anything face to face- public or not. I thought about what you all said about messaging them, but I ruled that out because I knew as soon as they read it I’d be in a shitstorm. I also thought about not saying anything, but I didn’t want to give them a reason to come and find me under the pretences of “we’re still in a relationship” or “why haven’t you come home or answered my hundreds of calls/texts.” And honestly, my heart saddened thinking of them sitting on that empty couch (I took all my fluffy pillows) in an apartment that now looks so barren, thinking about where I went and why. I *know* I don’t owe them anything, but it’s difficult to just stop caring for someone, even when they hurt you. I decided on a letter but I kept it as vague and full of cliches as possible so if worse came to worse, they wouldn’t hold it against me. 

It read: 

“I’m breaking up with you. I’m unhappy and we’ve grown apart. I appreciate the good times we had together but I need some change in my life. You don’t treat me as good as you used to and I don’t think that’s going to change, so I need to leave. Please don’t contact me in person or over the phone. If you do, I’ll call the police. (This is a white lie. I wouldn’t, but I’m hoping it’s enough of a threat) 
If you’re feeling unsafe, please call the Samaritan’s or a hospital. (I left them some numbers.) If you contact me with this information, I’m truly sorry and I wouldn’t want that, but I can’t be there for you and I’ll call your mother to see if she can help you instead. 

You broke my trust with what happened the other day. You know what I’m talking about. I did really, really love you, but now I need to leave.”

They know where my best friend lives, and I’m there now, but I love being around Grace. She’s truly an angel and my parents live too far away from work. I wouldn’t want to tell my mum anything either, it would just upset her and that’s the last thing I want. They know where all of my close friends live so it wouldn’t be much different. Should I give it a few days and see if it’s okay?

I don’t want to go to the police or a woman’s shelter. They’ve never hit me and I wouldn’t want to take up resources when I’m okay and I have places to go. The police sound like a nightmare. I don’t want to press charges, write statements, or have to prove anything, or god forbid go to court. I tried to call a women’s helpline but her voice was so soft and so full of pity that I couldn’t hack it. Maybe in a few months when I’ve had time to process I’ll try again, but for now I don’t think I can. It’s good though to know that in a crisis I have someone to talk to. 

I keep thinking about what happened between us before I left. I keep turning it over in my head obsessively until I feel sick but I can’t begin to think about it critically. You were so kind, caring and empathetic to me, thank you -especially taking away my “yes” from the weapons table if you will. I couldn’t really see it as assault because after that thing I was uncomfortable with they did make an effort to comfort me and ask if I was okay. I just don’t understand why someone who loves me would seek to hurt me in such a manipulative way. Whenever I doubt myself into thinking it didn’t happen the way I think it did or that maybe they misunderstood the signs, I read through your replies about trusting myself. I’m still so confused, angry, and saddened about the whole ordeal. 

But I’ve finally left which seems like a miracle. I’m with Grace, who I love and trust. I’ve got all my friends around me too. I don’t have to see my ex-partner until forever if that’s the way I want it. For the first time in a long time things are looking up. Thank you for everything.",99,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/bmrtmn/my_now_ex_trans_partner_update/

agq6pk,"""Not all women have a uterus""",557,"Long-time anonymous lurker here, decided to make an account.  I'm recently Peak Trans and read all the resources on the sidebar and I feel like Gender Critical feminism makes the most sense to me.

I want to tell you something.

I was born a female.  I had horrendous issues with my female parts in my 20's.  My ovaries ballooned up with painful cysts that would send me to the emergency room, bent over in tears.  My periods were unpredictable, ranging from downpours to absent, and never on any regular schedule.  Getting put on birth control pills mitigated both of those problems, but of course insurance didn't cover them all those years ago so I paid out of pocket.

My mother died in her early 50's.  Cancer.  Her father died of cancer even younger.  When I began to research that side of the family, it was everywhere... almost everyone genetically related to me through my mother died of cancer.

I paid out of pocket for genetic testing.  It was a couple thousand dollars.  But it revealed to me what I feared: I had the BRCA1 genetic mutation.  My mother almost certainly had it.  My mutation was associated with particularly malignant ovarian cancers.

On one fine day, I let a surgeon open my body and take my ovaries.  He took my uterus and cervix, too.  This was so I could be put on pure estrogen HRT.  Estrogen plus progesterone can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, which is bad when you're already BRCA1 positive, but without progesterone I was told the lining of my uterus would thicken uncontrollably from the estrogen and place me at an increased risk of endometrial cancer.  For the best chance of survival, it all had to go.

Then, once I had healed from that violation, I let a team of two surgeons open my body again.  One surgeon cut out all the tissue from both breasts.  The other surgeon filled the empty spaces with implants and stitched me shut.  The thing about implants after a mastectomy is that there's no breast tissue left to hide the weird way the silicone wants to ripple.  For the best cosmetic result, the implants are shoved into a pocket that is opened up under your pectoral muscles.  Does that sound like it hurts a lot?  Because it does.  I could scarcely roll over or sit up without help for a week.  I had four drains in my chest for two weeks.  Some of my remaining skin lost its blood supply and died, requiring a second surgery to remove it.  It was two months before I could raise my arms above my head again.  The implants move when my pectoral muscles do.  It looks strange and unnatural.

These are the things we do to survive.  I now have zero genuine female parts... just scars where they used to exist.  I remember what I told the surgeon right before they sedated me.  I told him that if he couldn't reconstruct me right then, to leave my chest flat.  I wasn't willing to go through two more surgeries just to have fake breasts.

Yet I am a woman.  When the women around me worry about their access to birth control, I don't shout at them that ""NOT EVERY WOMAN CAN GIVE BIRTH!""  When women complain about the tampon tax, I don't pitch a fit because I don't have a uterus.  I don't have breasts any more, but I care about breast cancer and mammograms and genetic testing.  I care about these things because I am a woman and I have empathy for those distinct, biological concerns that women have.

I guess what I'm saying is: don't let anyone tell you that it's not okay to talk about your female parts.  Those of us who had them, and lost them, still stand in solidarity with you.  The people trying to silence you aren't doing it for the comfort of people like me.  They're doing it for the comfort of people who were never women, who never shared the concerns of women, and who are taking up disproportionate space in feminism.

We talk about FGM even though it's not something all women go through. We talk about a lot of things that aren't universal experiences as long as they're the result of misogyny. By TRA logic, we shouldn't be allowed to talk about any form of misogyny ever because not all women go through the exact same things. 

If they genuinely believed that transwomen were a subcategory of women, they would just talk about the experiences of transwomen as opposed to telling us to shut up.

cpnucc,Yes. Intersex people exist. We know.,552,"Intersex people are people with any combination of physical, hormonal, or genetic/chromosomal aberrations which make it difficult or impossible to determine their sex. They may be physically somewhere in between male and female, and they often have ambiguous genitalia and have invasive surgery forced on them as children, meaning many of them are literally assigned a gender at birth.

You, on the other hand, are a man. Physically and genetically, there is little to no difference between you and any other healthy, fully functional male. You were not ""assigned"" male. You were *observed* to be male. There was nothing unusual about your body until you decided to fuck with it. Maybe you have a mental problem, maybe you have a fetish, maybe you've been taken advantage of by ""communities"" of older men, whatever. None of that is in the same *ballpark* as an intersex condition, which is quantifiable and real.

Stop bringing up intersex people in your diatribes. Stop comparing your condition to theirs. And stop appropriating their vocabulary and their struggle with terms like ""AMAB"" and ""AFAB.""",35,,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cpnucc/yes_intersex_people_exist_we_know/
b64jgb,Reason why trans women lose their shit when they are misgendered,553,"Trans women know they are men.  the drugs they pump themselves full of in order to chemically alter their body to mimic what they perceive as femininity.  It's not real, not a permanent change, it's a temporary alteration which needs to be constantly reinforced to maintain the illusion.  They freak out so badly when someone interferes with their need to maintain the illusion.

Not a one of them, not a single one, actually believes they can change sex.  If they did, they wouldn't need all the outside validation.  I've seen women and men 'misgendered' a few times.  Happens in retail when you are frazzled or hear someone's voice and associate it with the wrong gender and I have never, ever seen one of them get upset about it.  Me included.

Why?  Because we don't need everyone else's affirmation of our identities so our connection to reality isn't affected if someone makes an incorrect assumption.  Our sense of self isn't threatened by someone else not acknowledging it, because it's not dependent on that.   Our lives aren't built on illusions that need to be maintained by everyone around us to keep from crumbling because that is called mental illness.

bo5sw5,Pornography is sexualizing stepfamilies and slowly normalizing incest.,549,"This is a crosspost from somewhere else but I added some thoughts into it afterwards. 

""In the last 5 years or so, I've noticed a massive influx of incest scenarios on Pornhub and other free-to-use tube sites. These insanely popular videos (some in the tens of millions of views) sexualize familial relationships, with the highest quality production going into depicting sexual acts between ""step"" mothers and sons, ""step"" fathers and daughters, step-siblings, etc. We have a number of videos in which actors are role-playing teenagers in high school. The actors are made to look as young as possible, and the situations attempt to capture a ""regular household"" in which a kid might have a step-brother or a step-father who is actively pursing a sexual relationship with them. In some videos, step-mothers are encouraging step-daughters to have sex with their sons, or husbands, and vice-versa.
We all have an awareness of these videos existing, because in the US they normally trend at the top of the most popular or most-viewed. Advertisements featuring incredibly young looking girls are now almost routine, and the highest quality pornography (which people naturally gravitate towards due to image resolution, or big-name stars) are featuring these incest fantasies. As an example, there's a video on Pornhub in which a teen climbs into her parents bed because she's scared, and her ""step-father"" has sex with her next to her sleeping mother. It's totally insane. That video has millions and millions of views. I feel as though no one can talk about it, no one can acknowledge it, and no one can do anything about it because sex and pornography is a taboo subject in the US, and most people are just fine without discussing what they privately enjoy. However, the faux-incest productions are slowly becoming a pervasive, unavoidable element to online pornography, and I cannot help but think there are consequences to depicting so much fake incest.
A lot of people are going to say this is fantasy, and harmless. I think that's a really good argument, and I would never be behind laws that prohibit the freedom to produce any kind of porn featuring consenting adults. However, I also think of the accessibility of pornography nowadays, and how many kids are online watching these videos and being exposed to a ton of incest scenarios. It's got to have some kind of effect, right? is it affecting adults? Is porn so divorced from reality that we can compartmentalize it and avoid any kind of behavioral influence? Is porn trying to mimic our everyday reality to appear more attractive and ""realistic""?""

Whats horrifying is that the comments were mostly ""nobody watches porn for the story"" and ""Its not that serious"" or ""let people have their fetishes""

I see this argument raised all the time, but folks don't account for how memories are physiologically formed at the neuronal level. You still ingest the titles, couple it with pleasure, and BAM! neuronal connection of incest/dopamine is created. Do this over and over and over at a population wide level and you have now moved the population towards normalized incest. I acknowledge that I might be wrong, I am not a neurologist, but that is definitely the theory that I am working with, and I would chance a bet that it is more valid than ""I don't watch porno for the stories"".
Also, if folks aren't watching it for the incest part, WHY IS THE GENRE EXPLODING? Have you seen the increase in posts about incest being ok in general on reddit too?

avgaur,FtMtF: Detransitioned TiF,546,"Hi GC,

The reason I'm posting this on a new account is because I delete and cycle my reddit accounts for the sake of anonymity every few months, and I wanted to leave this account up.

I'm a 21 year old adult female human living in Scotland. I first identified as transgender age 15/16. Started hormones at 18. Top surgery December 2017.

Throughout my treatment, I was never offered therapy relating to gender. I was just told Yes. In fact, I don't think they were allowed to question me or ask where my beliefs came from. I seriously regret most aspects of my transition. Luckily for me, testosterone didn't react well, meaning I got barely any side effects. My voice is still solidly in the female range, my body comp never changed. The only lasting side effects from T that bother me are the facial hair and enlarged clit. But to be honest, the average woman who struggles with PCOS has more facial hair than me, and if they can handle it I bloody well can!

Obviously the biggest thing I did was have a double mastectomy with chest wall reconstruction. I am of two minds as to whether I regret this. On the one hand, I despised my DD chest and wearing bras. It was never comfortable for me. In fact having the surgery and feeling so happy with my body was a huge factor that made me realise I wasn't trans. I just have body dysmorphia/ an eating disorder (undiagnosed because NHS mental health support is...non existent and I'm too poor for private).

However. I had to spend a lot of money travelling to Manchester and back to get the surgery, and the after care was atrocious. Aesthetically my results are good, but I got pneumonia after surgery. Then I had consistent pain which developed into a staph infection in my left breast. I still have pain. I went to the doctors many times but they couldn't get me seen. My post op check up is THIS SATURDAY. That's...14 months almost since my operation.

I have been publically detrans for about 4 months now. Changing my name back and explaining to everyone was horrible, but my family are all so relieved. My mother says by the time I'm 30 it will all be an embarrassing teenage phase. Except goths don't usually get life changing surgery.

All I can say is thank god I woke up when I did. They were fast tracking me for a hysto. Still no therapy. There isn't even a specialised clinic in the North.

I am not open about my radical feminism. I would be labelled a transphobe by all my woke friends. But I no longer believe in gender theory, trans theory, none of it. I can't believe I fucked myself up based on patriarchal bullshit because I was a tomboy.

My reason for posting this is because I see people complaining detrans aren't visible enough. It's hard to be visible because LGBT groups hate to acknowledge us. They want us silenced. Read their rhetoric online and see them calling detrans people idiotic, crazy, liars, TERFs.

Well...I am a TERF. I'm an adult human female, and I think that the amount of young people identifying as trans and being fast tracked through surgery and hormones and legal changes with NO THERAPY OR QUESTIONING is absolutely insane.

So I'm here, anonymously but visible to GC. I'm not quite brave enough to out myself as GC to the wider world. ""Social suicide"".

Tl;dr: 21 detrans Scotland, UK. Bisexual adult human female.

c7giem,"Just so you all know, dykes got banned from the Dyke March for actually celebrating lesbians and advocating for themselves",548,"Someone I follow on Instagram, theviolentfembot, went to the Dyke March (in NYC, I’m pretty sure?) with a group of other lesbians. They held a banner and signs that celebrated Storme. The Official New York City Dyke March, aka the dick worshipping homophobes, banned all “hate speech” against “trans lesbians” and goddamn “sex workers.” My girls were blocked from the parade and left on the sidelines (as you can see in her story) as well as harassed. Meanwhile all the libfems, straight women who label themselves “queers.” men in dresses and “sex positive” women get to walk around in rainbows and sparkles celebrating every Tom, Dick or Harry that walks in and “identifies” themselves as a lesbian. I’m appalled. I have no patience for this shit anymore.

cijngk,Yes. All TIMs need to answer for Yaniv.,549,"Because ""trans women"" have been boosted up, as a supposedly oppressed pseudo-class, based on the promise, the *lie*, that people like Yaniv don't exist. That this doesn't happen, and that it would never happen. Nearly every single one of them has said this at some point. And they were all wrong. Own up to it and change the story. Stop lying to us. Don't pretend we're being unreasonable.",89,trans women,GenderCritical,https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cijngk/yes_all_tims_need_to_answer_for_yaniv/
