So far I see it as a great resource for allies/friends/family of transgender persons, not the person them-self.

I do find it funny how he pairs gender-surgeries with HRT; IMHO surgeries are worlds more invasive to be even comparable to HRT.

**Resources:**

In addition to the stuff I've already posted, here's what I've got:

I really like the YouTubers [Angel and Nicole](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6LR2z3l3MnHD1Sr7rbTUbg)and their organization [TheOneFrontier](https://www.theonefrontier.com/resources).  They've got a lot of vlogs about LGBT stuff and their website has a bunch more resources that they like.  Someday they'd like to build an LGBT Christian Youth Retreat.

[Here's an article about trans stuff from a Catholic perspective](https://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201805/transgender-and-catholic-31392).

I know I mentioned [GayChurch.org](https://www.gaychurch.org/homosexuality-and-the-bible/the-bible-christianity-and-homosexuality/) above but they really do have a ton of articles and stuff.  I'd highly recommend spending time just wondering around their site.

[HopeRemains](http://hoperemainsonline.com/) is a site with Catholic-focused resources.

[Jessica Kellgren-Fozard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhADVL2AiGX9WxOo6w6QbkRdCBX97Bkgh) is a deaf British lesbian YouTuber who is Quaker and has several videos devoted to what Quakerism is and how it handles LGBT people.  IIRC, she talks about how they were one of the first Christian Denominations to affirm LGBT people.

[This is a tumblr that has a lot of good stuff](https://queerchristianaffirmations.tumblr.com/faq).  Note especially the chat groups for LGBT Christians at the bottom of that page.

Also if you're on Tumblr I recommend following [QueerlyChristian](https://queerlychristian.tumblr.com/).  It's a blog that provides a lot of support and perspectives on Queer Christian stuff and they run a podcast about transgender christian stuff (Blessed be the Binary Breakers).  (side note: I've not listened to the podcast so while I recommend the tumblr, I cannot comment on the quality of the podcast but if it's as good as their tumblr, it'll be good).

**My Beliefs**

Now that the more official stuff is out of the way, here is how I personally reconciled LGBT people and Christianity.  I use the word ""Affirming"" a lot and it's important to note the difference between someone ""Accepting"" LGBT people and ""Affirming"" them (and don't even get me started on ""tolerance"").  ""Acceptance"" is what you do at the end of grieving.  You *accept* a loss.  You *accept* the death of a loved one.  Someone who is accepting is someone who says ""Well, I still don't like it but since I realize there's nothing I can do about it, I suppose I can welcome you into my home and be friendly with you and whatnot.  But really, if given the opportunity, I would change the situation.""  Someone who is *Affirming* is someone who celebrates your identity.  Someone who loves you *because* of who you are instead of in spite of it.  An affirming parent might say ""Oh you're gay?  Alright, do you have a girlfriend?"" (or boyfriend if you're a dude).

Also, when I mention ""Christian Doctrine"" I mean ""Christian Doctrine"" as I understand it.  There are thousands of different types of Christianity each with doctrine just a little different than all the others.  It should also be noted that once someone has made up their mind about something, it can take a long time to change it if they ever change it.  Anyone with Christian loved ones should not expect to shout theology at them and expect them to rationally and instantly decide that they're a-okay with the gay (or trans).

Backstory: I was Christian long before I realized I was trans.  I had not been raised in the church, but had a general understanding of what Christianity was because my parents took us to Christmas Eve services with my grandparents and when I was 15 made the decision to be baptized and come to Christ.  The church I attended was (and as far as I know still is) *extremely* conservative.  While they were technically non-denominational, their views lined up very closely with Southern Baptist and Evangelical beliefs.  This is the environment that my faith was born into and like a sponge it absorbed *all of it*.  I'm ashamed at the views I used to have and worse be vocal about.

During college I started to loosen up and slowly drift left.  I used to say I was far-right but ten years ago ""far-right"" meant something different than it does now.  Lets put it this way:  I don't know that I *would* have voted for Trump but I also don't know that I *wouldn't* have and that scares me.  Luckily, that young man doesn't vote any more (lol can you imagine if he could see the lesbian he would someday become).  (I'm not going to go into detail about how and why I stopped being conservative b/c it's a long story that's not super important right now).

I actually became LGBT affirming before I realized I was LGBT myself.  I was pretty against same-sex marriage until one day when I was driving to church and I heard a program on the radio where a guy would host a radio show as Jesus.  It isn't as weird as it sounds, it was mostly a place where people would call in for prayers and the show made it clear that it was for artistic reasons and the host in no way actually believed he was the risen Christ.

Anyway, his argument was basically that there was no reason that Christians shouldn't support secular same-sex marriage rights if their only argument was that God wouldn't bless those marriages.  He asked the audience if they believed that marriages between atheists, Muslims, Buddhists, etc were blessed and if not, they either needed to campaign against those too or not worry about same-sex marriage.  From there I slowly started to realize that God probably doesn't condemn homosexuality.  There's a lot of stuff online about how the places in Leviticus and Romans that damn homosexual behavior are probably mistranslated (a better translation would probably be pedophilia) but you can look those up on your own (they're in the resources I've listed).  For me, Galatians 3:28 overrides any condemnation of gay love:

>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Becoming gay-affirming primed me to become trans-affirming.  At that point I was like, yeah okay, God probably doesn't have any problem with it so I won't either.  I didn't ever get any more specific than that until my egg cracked and I started wondering how and why God would make me or anyone else trans if only to condemn the idea of people transitioning.

Christian doctrine teaches that the universe was once perfect but sin entered the world when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (I'm not a creationist but we can talk about how evolution and whatnot fit with the doctrine of Original Sin some other time).  At that point, sin entered the universe and corrupted *everything.*  It didn't just corrupt our relationship with God.  It seeped into our bones and into our genes.  It changed the way we interact with the ground we walk on.  When Christians talk about ""Sin"" in a theological sense, it isn't just a verb (""sin"" is not just something someone does that is bad).  Sin-the-noun I think would be best described as an evil version of the Force from Star Wars.  It exists all around us and we wade through it daily.

My belief is that God created our souls and that sin corrupted our bodies once we were conceived.  I don't know if God creates souls gendered or not.  Maybe God creates male, female, and other gendered souls and then sin mutates the body into something the soul doesn't fit into and thus you get dysphoria.  Maybe God doesn't create gendered souls and dysphoria comes from somewhere else.  I don't know.  There's a lot I don't know.

But I know one thing: God loves us.  Every one of us.  Any Christian who disagrees is letting their own biases get in the way of that.

ey17c8o,"Not everyone is educated about transgender issues, despite your thinking that they do. Some people need a better place than google to get information about transgender issues- and I’m willing to say the best resource would be a transgender person, someone who’s been through a transition. Some people are afraid to ask transgender people in their lives for fear of sounding dumb- it’s a little more anonymous on the internet and I’m happy to answer any questions so long as they’re not disrespectful.

It’s kind of rude of you to assume that transgender people transition for attention. What makes you think trans people want attention brought to themselves when there’s so much violence against us? What makes you think someone will walk into the bathroom and say “hey everyone! I’m transgender! I’m peeing in here!” Because obviously that’s not how it works. It’s actually pretty fucking shitty to be transgender in this day and age, and people like you are a part of that. I’m not demanding people ask me anything, I’m simply opening up the opportunity in case there’s anyone who has questions.

ey17luq,"> 6 Days ago: New Trump Admin Rule Would Let Religious Employers Fire LGBT, Jewish Employees, Critics Warn

The rule is about the freedom of religious employers. It's not about taking rights away from anyone.

From [the proposal](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-17472.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&utm_source=federalregister.gov) itself:
> this proposal is intended to make clear that the Executive Order 11246 religious exemption covers not just churches but employers that are organized for a religious purpose, hold themselves out to the public as carrying out a religious purpose, and engage in exercise of religion consistent with, and in furtherance of, a religious purpose.

This proposal is meant to allow religious organizations to hire based on their practices. It's not like the manager at McDonald's who doesn't like gay people is going to be able to fire people just like that.

> Not just trying, succeeding. Started by banning trans people from the military

Trans people were banned from the military because of the high rate of depression, suicide, and the fact that hormone therapy can cause unpredictable mood changes and other health problems.

As someone who just recently went through the process of joining the military, I can tell you they have barred people for much more trivial reasons than that.

> undoing healthcare regulations that protected lgbt people from discrimination, rolling back obama era protections for trans students, trying to define transgender out of existence, pressuring independent non-profit youth organization 4-H to withdraw their pro-LGBT policy, filling courts with anti-LGBT, anti-abortion judges, filling his cabinet with anti-lgbt people, fired everyone in the HIV/AIDS council, list goes on.

Your bias is showing with this list. You refuse to learn how or why these are implemented and instead opt to misunderstand them in the most blatant and judgmental ways. Doctors can't refuse to fix a broken arm just because the patient is gay. However, a doctor can refuse to perform an abortion because they feel performing it would be immoral. [Source](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/final-conscience-rule.pdf). The Obama Admin guidance on Title IX was changed because of sexual assault, not trans students. Also, being called by the wrong pronoun is not a violation of your rights (I would know; when I was 10 I was called a girl a few times myself). Trump ""defining transgender out of existence""? Lol. That proposal simply refers to the word ""sex"", not ""gender"". It would legally define ""sex"" as the same thing it is usually defined as in the dictionary- the biological state of being male or female. ""Transgender"" would not be redefined out of existence, because the word ""gender"" is not being redefined. [Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjvjfKIvZzkAhUjw1kKHeYNA8EQzPwBegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F10%2F21%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftransgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html&psig=AOvVaw0sc_x7zB41nkin4Vo7Qh5H&ust=1566769423845714). The 4-H thing? Saying Trump did that is beyond a stretch. A chief-of-staff of the USDA (which is in charge of 4-H) under Sonny Perdue, Heidi Green, who is no longer employed with the USDA, who wasn't even appointed by Trump, requested a piece of 4-H's new guidance regarding LGBT members be removed. How this equates to ""Trump rolling back on LGBT rights"" is beyond me.

""Other people are homophobic, so Trump must be too"". Lol. First of all, that's bullshit and you know it. Second, you do know you have to have some kind of proof for these claims? I mean until now I thought that's what your bold and incorrect claims were about. Anyways, what does abortion have to do with LGBT rights? Lmao, you know only heterosexual couples can get pregnant, right? Or are you just another lefty who doesn't care about science?

Also, HIV and AIDS effect straight people, too. And the HIV/AIDS council is back to running again. [Source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/presidential-advisory-council-hiv-aids-back-business-more-than-a-year-after-members-were).

And does the list go on? I don't think it does. At the end there you really started to grasp at straws.

> Ted Cruz was introduced at his rally by a ""kill the gays"" pastor.

Ted Cruz isn't ""the majority of right wingers"". Also, again, ""Ted Cruz is homophobic because some other dude is homophobic"". I don't buy it.

> The christian taliban is a part of the trump admin.

Last I checked the Trump Administration wasn't trying to institute theocracy. Also the vast majority of Christians don't condone terrorism in any form, let alone ""in the name of God"", unlike Islam, which also says homosexuality should be punished (along with condoning pedophilia). Trump doesn't even go to church regularly, so the notion that he's some sort of Christian extremist is just bogus.

> Israel doesn't even have inter-religious marriage, let alone gay marriage. It has an official state religion, sharia courts, laws based on religion, religious schools funded by the state, and a racist colonial policy of subsidizing illegal settlements on occupied land, justified by religious lunacy.

Israel doesn't perform same-sex marriages, but it recognizes gay marriages performed elsewhere and condones homosexuality in virtually every other issue. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Israel). Israel also respects freedom of religion and freedom of speech. They certainly aren't a perfect country, but if you would prefer the Palestine Authority, who literally persecutes people for being homosexual, that makes *you* the homophobe, not me.

> But I *would* discriminate. I absolutely would not trust a creationist doctor for example. Of course religious fundamentalists do not belong in positions of power, public or private.

And there you go. ""I don't like this group of people so they should be barred from power"". Good thing those old religious people instituted democracy so you can vote for who you want in power!

ey17zak,"Could you elaborate on what exactly would be the difference between the mental based and the physical based versions, and how you think they should be treated differently?

As far as I know most of my dysphoria focused on my body, that I wanted to be physically male and was very uncomfortable with being bio female. I was bothered by being seen as a woman socially, but that was always secondary. I liked being feminine and usually brushed off ""misgendering"" etc, although it annoyed me. Sure I wanted to be socially recognised as a man, but it was ultimately far less important to me than having a male body or at least appear as close to it as medically possible. I wanted a flat chest, narrow hips, deep voice, facial hair, body hair, male genitals, etc. I never confused masculinity for maleness or femininity for femaleness as I grew up with a very masculine mother and slightly effeminate father, and my being a lesbian and my denial of it actually had very little to do with why I thought I was trans and ended up living as an effeminate gay/bi trans man. 

My point is all that was driving me to transition was my hatred of my femaleness and my wish to appear physically male. I did end up medically and socially transitioning to a trans man, then detransitioning and re-identifying back to a woman. The treatment I needed all along was therapy for my past traumas, which was the source of my dysphoria. Alas, transitioning was not what I needed.

I have on occasion read body-focused dysphoria described as ""sex dysphoria"" but it's very commonly accompanied by social dysphoria also sometimes referred to as ""gender dysphoria"", cause they like overlap really a lot and tend to exacerbate each other. Even I who was at core sex dysphoric and not truly happy in living as a man, got gender/social dysphoria over time which was then exacerbated by my sex dysphoria. They were very intertwined. I've rarely ever heard of people who have/had sex dysphoria without thinking they're trans at all or had no amount of social dysphoria. Although I think that's surely possible, I don't think it's common at all. However it seems much more common to have social dysphoria but no sex dysphoria accompanying it. 

So, in my highly uneducated opinion on this complicated topic... I don't think they can be truly separated for a lot of, if not most, dysphoric people. The brain and the body are connected. Psycho-therapy can treat body/sex dysphoria just like it can treat gender/social dysphoria, based on my own experience. However I'm not against people choosing to medically transition as a way to alleviate their dysphoria. Although I'm not a fan of it and it clenches my gut, I won't butt in on anyone's personal choices about their own bodies. I'd gain nothing from doing so.

I don't think trying to separate sex dysphoria from social dysphoria entirely would even be possible. They're two sides of the same coin, and I think that coin of any dysphoria related to sex, gender, gender roles, etc, is a complex psychological condition with a lot of different possible causes; ranging from peer pressure to hormone imbalances and abuse, and much more. Additionally, I think how it's best to be treated depends on what caused it for each individual person who has it.","<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(1053, 1062), match='trans man'>",detrans,r/detrans | Detransition Subreddit,reddit.com/r/detrans/comments/cuy8hs/does_this_sound_like_a_possible_solution/ey17zak/
