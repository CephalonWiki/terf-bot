Text:   I mean, you're right, but that doesn't mean there aren't still people out there that feel gender dysmorphia without feeling the need to change their body/genitals. Non-binary people exist too, so that's a thing. I'm a cis woman myself, so I'm not trying to attack anyone. You don't have to feel any different about yourself. But there are people out there that do deal with these things and I'm not just gonna tell them their experiences aren't valid either.

Text:   And this might be pretty close to my thoughts on this subject. A big reason why this video has me so fucking janked is because the admittedly indirect dismissal of men’s pain, to me, is the dismissal of subjects that were way more serious than anything she was thinking about when she made this.
Not thinking about something isn’t the same as not caring. People on this sub occasionally forget that entire groups of people (lesbians, trans men, etc) exist,  but when pressed really do care about their wellbeing. 
My greatest fear, both for Contra and this subreddit, is that even those who take things like male sexual abuse seriously are going to feel like expressing sympathy is some kind of cardinal sin. I have a somewhat unhealthy emotional investment in the attitudes of this community.

Post:   Ferris pronoun stickers at RustConf!
Text:   As mentioned before, pronouns in the English language already have various overloaded connotations that makes it such that misusing pronouns in one direction bears more significance than misusing them in the other direction.
I agree that it would be nice if this were not the case. Ideally, "it" wouldn't have a negative connotation, or "they" wouldn't have an existing gender neutral (as opposed to gender nonbinary) definition.
Unfortunately, that's not the case. The way I see it, then, there are three options:
1. Use "they/them" to refer to gender nonbinary people, if that's what they prefer, and accept that this gives them a "linguistic advantage".
2. Introduce new, connotation- and existing definition- free pronouns into the English language, such as "ze/zer".
3. Continue to misgender nonbinary people, even after they ask you not to.
Each option has tradeoffs. For 1, you have to accept that you have fewer options for referring to gender nonbinary people than for cisgender people, which you might refer to as a "linguistic advantage" or such (although you'll only run into this issue in the rare occasion that you encounter an out nonbinary person, so it shouldn't be too bad). For 2, you have to get used to using a new word that other people might not be familiar with (although you'll only run into this issue in the rare occasion that you encounter an out nonbinary person, so it shouldn't be too bad). For 3, you disrespect nonbinary people and normalize transphobia (which nonbinary people will have to deal with time and time again, throughout their entire lives).
Ultimately, it's your choice. Again, it's unfortunate that there isn't a perfect solution.

Post:   how long did you take between questioning to cracking??
Text:   The edges are pretty blurry for me.
First of all, most people in my life were pretty hostile to me exploring my gender identity, when I was like 7. I felt a little judged whenever I did. But that's the earliest we've managed to come to. 
Since then I never really questioned my gender until early adulthood, where I was left to my own devices. Here I wanted to transition, for some indefinable reason that I did not want to explore further.  
Some years later, I realized that the bad feelings I was feelings were probably dysphoria, and I started exploring my gender identity proper. I still don't know my gender, but I know what it isn't, so.   
**TLDR:** 
Don't know.   
If you take my first instance of gender dysphoria until I started transitioning: a decade or two.   
If you take my first instance of wanting to transtion/ present femme: 5 months- 1 year
If you take first questioning my gender consciously until realizing I was trans: like, 5 minutes.

Text:   Had a hysto in the US (Texas); insurance (BCBS) paid 24k-ish (under "transgender healthcare benefits*"), I paid $2,250 ($250 copay + $2000 deductible)
Idk how to find trans doctors. What I did is I arranged a consultation with an OBGYN who performed hystos and we spoke about the details. I'm 24 and as soon as she looked at me she was very gung-ho about allowing me access to the stage of my transition that she was able to provide. My 26 year old sister was denied a hysto due to her age at a different OBGYN so maybe being trans will actually help you find a willing surgeon?
Before top surgery my chest was between an A and an AA and I ended up getting DI because of my skin elasticity (I couldn't be happier with my results). Keep in mind that skin elasticity may result in excess skin around the pecs (although I've seen this in guys who were told they were "borderline" rather than given the all-clear).
*no idea about your insurance but my benefits state that you have to be on T for at least a year before they cover any surgery besides top surgery

Also while reddit is dominated by AMAB people tumblr is actually \*equally\* male and female  - or was in 2013 [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/20/5-facts-about-tumblr/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/20/5-facts-about-tumblr/)  Which means unless tumblr has a breathtaking amount of trans men that tumblr is probably equally amab and afab.
Personally I don't think it's about platform so much as community. I'm active over on indiemakeupandmore which is like 99% women (idk what the trans-to-cis ratio is - but AFAIK there's a lot of cis women) with a couple of enbies in the mix. The more dudely parts of tumblr obviously exist - but I'll be damned if I know what they are.
I think w/ this sub it attracts lots of trans women in a kind of chicken-and-egg situation - its really supportive and has a lot of trans women content, therefore trans women are more likely to feel comfortable participating.

but then...

Ahhh, the classic anorexia comparison. Because anorexia is just such a great comparison to this hypothetical real-and-nonexaggerated BDD. Totally the same thing.
We all know the real reason they make these comparisons is because if you choose a real non-gender-related analog to dysphoria (for example, some kind of birth-related or accident-related disfigurement causing emotional distress), almost nobody would disagree that fixing the defect with some kind of surgery (for example, any kind of reconstruction surgery) is a good idea. Teaching people to live with their defects is only wise when the defect is prohibitively expensive or dangerous to correct.

Text:   Used to believe that transexualism was a fad along with all the other gender-this-and-that popping up in the early 10's. I was certain it was for people who needed attention who were throwing their lives away for short-term gain. I was also vehement about it being a form of escapism for "sad losers" and the like.
Four years later I quickly realized how stupid the notion was when it dawned on me that I had shown super-obvious signs my whole life, and was in fact transsexual. Though I will probably not change gender myself until the process is less rocky, I now respect and understand transgender people a lot more.
Bonus: Shook a lot of firm beliefs along with it, like how I thought communism was great and infallible, and how I was an edgy punk-rocker.

Text:   Naoto's gender isn't even her biggest issue, it's her size and age. THAT is brought up just as much if not more in dialogue, but people only remember the big whammie moments. The same goes for Kanji. Plus a glance at P4D and the end of P4 Golden pretty much puts a bullet in the head of the "Naoto is trans" argument. Plus you have the fact her nickname in the Arena games point out her insecurity is her age. 
The big problem comes from a misunderstanding of just WHAT the shadow is. Just because the Shadow Self SAYS it is the true self doesn't make it true. That is Pat's whole issue with Yukiko. Yukiko resented the idea she had no choice and it was expected of her. But what happens when she decides to go and take classes to seek her own path? EVERYBODY supports her. She was her own worst enemy. And just because Shadow Chie says Chie exploits Yukiko doesn't mean she actually does, just that there is a definite power dynamic there she fears is wrong. 
And I gotta say that Kanji is a case of an English Voice actor either himself being, or having been directed WRONG on a character in regards to this topic. 
And it all winds down to associating gender identity with social roles and sexuality, something the characters are supposed to stand AGAINST. You are actively enforcing the ideas that these are all strictly tied together. People, in thinking they're being progressive in their views, are really just being incredibly patronizing and implying some pretty shitty things.
And none of this is debatable because it's all there in the text and audio in the game and in interviews and in how the characters are after Golden.
And Persona is one of those few games where you can actually argue on a more objective level because it has so strictly worked itself around the framework of Jungian psychology and assorted philosophies and religions.
It's just hard when there are certain nuances that understandably fly over people's heads, like Shadows not being "Evil" versions or that the world of Persona is not about good/bad morality in a world with a God who is himself good. Persona is entirely a story about humanism and the special qualities in humanity that allow them to regulate and avert total destruction. The road may be bumpy, but in the end humanity makes the right choice. A completely neutral timeline in SMT. It's as soon as people start trying to hammer in that square peg of old classical fiction morals into the round peg of Persona that things become an interpretive mess. 
I am actually VERY happy new character Kasumi seems to be picking up with the final big act of the vanilla game and running with it philosophically, in regards to "God is dead for we have killed him".  I believe that ultimate, Nietzsche-esque sentiment is what is needed to convey that the ultimate victory is about creating a world of good, but a world of choice even at the expense of future Kamoshidas and Shidos.  People seem to have difficulty understanding the idea of a society only half believing in them, but that's how it should be. They, the PT, are actually stepping into a sort of God like role for humanity. They're Santa. Maybe they're real. Maybe they're watching. A lot of people believe. A lot of people don't, and there's no way for anybody in the world to ever know. So many will continue to fear the PT and let that factor into their decisions. Others will not. The point isn't for the PT to do anything, but let people think they might. 
Persona in being this consumer product with a world wide audiences grounded in a school of thought based around the cross cultural connections of myth, and how society plays a factor in shaping people like a market shapes a consumer, has created this interesting sort of social experiment in the form of fandom.

Post:   AITA For considering not giving my daughter money for her surgeries.
Text:   Its likely that what your friend is paying is subsidized by an insurance plan or deferred payment plan. Right now breast augmentation is almost never covered for trans women. And FFS is only covered by a small handful of plans - and even in the plans that cover it, usually its the less experienced surgeons.
Breasts are $5-10k right off the bat. There's literally no qualified usa surgeons that do breast augmentation for less than that for trans women. (note because of rib cage differences in some trans women, not all breast augmentation doctors are capable of providing their services - and some will just straight up refuse).
FFS on the other hand greatly depends on so many factors that it really does range from 20-50k, with outliers reaching into 75k (full work + one of the best surgeons) and down to 5k (going to latin america + bare minimal work).
It should make sense when you consider that someone who had their facial shape structured more prominently by male puberty, would need more work to obtain a feminine face on average. To make matters more confusing, femininizing hormones can reshape soft tissue in the face hiding some features, but this process isn't effective to the same degree in all people.
So for instance, your friend might not need chin work or forehead reconstruction (the two most expensive things). I guess the point I'm driving home is that you can't compare the cost of surgery because the surgeries are going to be different (not even accounting for different surgeons having different prices).
Next we have to consider the fact that your friend isn't getting gcs/srs (bottom surgery) in those estimates. While OPs daugther has insurance that pays the direct costs of that operation, it won't cover everything. Travel to the hospital site (usually factoring in cost of a friend or family member to stay with you) + 3 week onsite recovery (not in the hospital but with a 1 hour drive). And then an additional 3 weeks minimum before returning back to work (with most top surgeons recommending 10-12 weeks total recovery postop). Not to mention hair removal in the bottom region prior to surgery (this usually is around 2-3k alone and not covered by insurance).
And while you might say why doesn't she just get it all done at the same hospital (its rare for ffs surgeons to do gcs/srs/bottom surgery) Additionally, its against general medical advice due to the stress it would put on your body (we'd be talking about 8-9 hours of being under maybe longer depending on the surgeons).
This is a thread that's relevant to varying costs by surgeon: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9u9tyr/ffs_cost/ (The only one below 20k was Rossi who has multiple medical malpractice suits).
Note I'd link you actual prices on doctors websites but I'm a bit limited due to the fact that almost zero ffs surgeons list costs on their website preferring to give you an estimate on consult. The reason for this is that FFS costs are constantly going up because there are so few good surgeons. This is the closest publically available listing price of various procedures (its not comprehensive and these are mid-low prices for a usa surgeon based on numbers).

Post:   Help me with my labels
Text:   In the 1990s you would have just been butch. There’s a long history of lesbians being gender nonconformist including downplaying hips and breasts but still identifying as women. So if you decide to identify as a woman you will have company! It is valid to be a nonconforming woman who is not totally comfortable with the boundaries of womanhood, because the patriarchy has made womanhood too small.
HOWEVER I suspect a lot of 90s butch women would have identified as non-binary and been happier that way if they’d had the label available to them at the time. You do have the label now and you should use it if it fits!! My partner is non-binary and I am super grateful they finally have a label that actually feels positive instead of negative!!
There’s some debate about whether non-binary people can be lesbian. My opinion is that as long as “woman” is *some part* of your identity (demi-girl, non-binary woman, etc) you can be lesbian.  So don’t let an attachment to being lesbian keep you from exploring nonbinary gender labels. You can have both.
I think demigirl or non-binary woman would be cool.
((Also consider that you could be a gender nonconformist trans man if you’re a man but you don’t want to give up dresses! Men can wear dresses if they want, and it’s bullshit to hold trans men to a stricter standard of masculinity.))

Text:   Part of it probably has to do with the image you see of Littles online. Small (in height as well as in weight), cute onesies, pigtails, a cutesy voice, a bit of a baby face but with full lips and all that jazz. When you don't fit the mold, it's hard to really think of yourself as fitting the label. But here's the thing: the vast majority do not look like the people in the photos you see online. There are tall littles with smaller caregivers, there are plus size littles, there are littles who don't like pink, there are male littles, there are non-binary littles and everything else you could possibly think of.
You don't have to be cutesy and adorable and pastels to be a little. As long as you have the tendencies, you are one. What you make out of the label is entirely on you. You don't have to fit the label, the label has to fit YOU.

Text:   Well, first of all, saying someone is lgbt is unclear. When you say this, I’m assuming you’re talking about transgender people. People who are transgender have gender dysphoria, and the only treatment available for that is to transition from male to female. If you’re instead referring to gay people or lesbians, then you’re still wrong. People who are gay or lesbian do not act like the opposite sex, they only like the same sex. There are plenty of feminine lesbians and masculine gay guys too.

Post:   Every trans person I know is fucking insane and I want out
Text:   I like to believe people are who they say they are so I give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to posts like these.
I can understand some frustration with online trans communities. A lot of them I’ve been part of are pretty depressing and it took me a long time to find one that managed to separate regular chat or posts from venting ones. Often unmoderated ones will devolve into constant venting and depressing or suicidal rants which isn’t what a lot of trans people need in terms of support.
However I can’t help but believe a lot of this persons post is exaggerated. I highly doubt tons of trans women are sending this guy dick pics unless he’s going into some explicitly NSFW channels, which do exist. I can believe it may have happened once, some random idiot sent me one because he was trying to hit on me one time, but a ton of them, from trans people, never. Also the constant “all trans people are literal freaks” is something I never hear from even the disgruntled trans people I know. Heck, I don’t think even Blair White would make such a broad statement.
Of course this person could have fallen into some dark trans space online and not the ones I’ve been part of, which are nothing like this. Again, I like to give the benefit of the doubt but random accounts created to pretend to be a minority to bash them are not uncommon at all.

Post:   Hi, I'm 5 months taking cypro. Are my tits done for?
Text:   I agree with you. In a perfect world, I would be advising everyone to use GnRH agonists to eliminate gonad derived steroids and start on a very low dose of transdermal E, gradually increased over the first couple of years of treatment avoiding all progestogens until TS3-TS4. Based on the fact that we know breast development works this way and works out fine in cisgender girls, perhaps the only disadvantage to this methodology would be a longer time to achieve desired results.
However, we sadly do not live in such a world. Progestogens and high dose estrogen monotherapy are both highly effective, very affordable and relatively safe (very safe in the case of high doses of estrogens) choices for MtF HRT, particularly at younger ages when most people do not have access to large sums of money for alternatives such as high dose Bicalutamide therapy. There are surgical options for poor/sub-optimal breast development. Conversely, there is unfortunately little that can be done for many forms of masculinisation.

If its a woman its not gay its just as simple as that. The fact that it would be a deal breaker for the next guy doesn’t make the first one gay, that doesnt make any sense when you think about it.

Post:   Almost a year taking hormones and im getting a bit antsy.
Text:   Taking horomones is sort of one-step removed from the causal action here... a better reading of whether you should be seeing changes is monitoring your actual horomone levels. For instance, are your Estrogen and Progesterone levels within female ranges... is your T within female ranges? Estrogen in very high does can start to suppress the production of T also, but it doesn't sound like you are there. 
All of the blockers have their own side effects. Spiro has a whole pile of them, and wasn't really intended to be a blocker for this purpose. From what I can gather, Cypro is probably the better one to take- you just have to be on the lookout for the rare liver symptoms if you take it. It is a standard blocker for a good chunk of the world. If you are in the US, they don't prescribe it for reasons mostly to do with profit's relationship with drug testing in the FDA, but you can safely order it from other countries. 
Anecdotal reports from masses of transwomen say that in addition to Estrogen, good Progesterone levels and a small amount of active T are pretty important for libido. There are some transwomen on blockers who report higher libidos than they had before, and I'd bet on the Progesterone for that.

This does not provide any analogy. Many (most?) medical treatments have "side effects". Essentially, the effectiveness of a treatment is determined by a balance of pros and cons, and transition treatments are considered, in last analysis, beneficial, and in this rationale they are covered by insurance etc.
>I've read through many transgender self-accounts, including the AGP ones
You most probably read what is selected in various GC online spaces, this does not provide a representive idea of what trans accounts really are. Here, for example, “become” who one “truly” is, is not a common account of how one describes their experience, as far as I have seen.

Text:   Yep, that word is straight. A man that's into a woman witha penis is straight, because he's into a woman. Trans people aren't a third gender. They don't need to get a different word, just like they don't need different bathrooms and gay people don't need a different name for marriage. Segregation is very old-fashioned.
If you are a straight man that can't deal with penis nobody is going to force it on you, but forcing other straight guys out of the label because they have different views is not ok.
Fact is, sexuality is about *which genders* you can be attracted to, it says nothing about that person's genitalia. That's more about personal preference and openness, but every straight guy *can* be attracted to a trans woman, since they might not even know she's trans. Another thing entirely is being willing to have sex with her.

>Conclusions
Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.
Its a band-aid.  You can't solve a mental illness with a physical change.  Pretending it is all going to be okay and letting a guy chop his dick off and pretend hes a chick is like ignoring an anorexic person starving themselves and going "well, they think they are fat so if we let them starve themselves they'll eventually stop".

Furthermore they are *agreeing with you*. If you’re just not into dick you’re just not into dick and thats honestly fine as long as you’re respectful and kind about turning someone down for it like you should be for any dealbreaker. Plenty of trans people themselves are only interested in sex with certain genital types!
If someone still has a problem being with a post op trans woman though, thats almost definitely transphobic. Vaginoplasty often makes their genitals indistinguishable and at that point you just have a hangup about them being assigned male at birth.

Yes, we are born as a different biological sex, and yes we don't deny that. We may not broadcast it, but that is mostly due to transphobia and the fear of being attacked. Which I can attest to personally. Studies of transgender people's brains show they are more similar to that of the opposite gender. (USC study, 2018) Which is the cause of gender dysphoria, 
Honestly, we're not different from anyone else in most respects. We laugh, we live and we love. We just want to live our lives in peace without worrying that we will be the next name read on the day of remembrance. We've all faced discrimination, rejections from family, some are kicked out of their homes, bigotry on the jobs, and of course straight up violence. Many of us have stared down our own deaths, many commit suicide due to the rampant bigotry. 
I'm sure I'll be downvoted to hell and back, but I figure it's worth it to at least get some kind of perspective out there from a part of the transgender community.

Text:   Too many things to reply to at once so I’ll just say some stuff here. 
Do I have all the answers? Nope.  That’s why I’m willing to engage with both sides on this, to find answers.  
I’m far more GC than QT.  So me saying self ID is great and everything is a free for all isn’t going to happen.  That’s how we get people like Yaniv stripping down and taking pictures of children in bathrooms.  But I’m also not going to pretend like stealth, fully transitioned trans women don’t exist.  That’s one of my biggest disagreements with many GC women.  They exist and they’ve been using women’s facilities for ages without anyone knowing.  I’m not going to throw those people to the wolves.  I have enough compassion to know that someone who for all intents and purposes appears to be and lives as a woman would be risking life and limb to use a men’s facility in many places and I’m not ok with that.  Yes, those are the outliers, but they do exist.  I also think that trans women have to have the same amount of compassion when it comes to female people needing safe spaces.  If everyone is gonna clock you anyway just please stay out.  Even freaking Blaire White of all people won’t use a women’s changing room at the gym due to having a dick.  It’s just polite. 
If someone commits a violent felony they shouldn’t be able to change their name or gender marker.  I feel like that’s one small compromise.  I also feel like felonies should be recorded by birth sex and not gender marker (ugh I hate even saying gender marker because of the “gender” part but I’m trying here folks, lol). There’s another compromise we could make.  There are lots of small things we could do (and big things!) that I think we could get all but the extreme ends on board with.  
So yeah, I’m not willing to give up female only spaces and resources for a male in a dress with a hardcore fetish.  I just won’t.  But I’m also not willing to let trans folks in conservative areas get fucked up when I wouldn’t even know if they were there anyway. 
Oh and my friends who are nice and cool and stuff?  They don’t use the women’s room. They don’t pass and they know it. They only go where they’re welcome.

Imagine a tall trans woman with masculine features who doesn’t have many stereotypical female traits, then a trans woman with more feminine features but similar character traits. I don’t think it’s fair to ascribe less womanhood to the first person because of how they were born, even though obviously they are a pretty big outlier in the category.

Text:   I've never heard of anyone saying saying female-identifying, and I can't imagine any of the trans people I know would enjoy being called that. For starters woman is a much better term than female, as female is often used by people to indicate sex instead of gender as an attempt to exclude trans women. Further, the fact that you feel the need to add "-identifying" subtly implies that you think that identifying as a woman isn't the same as being one. I understand the desire to be explicitly inclusive of trans people, but they'll generally be happier if you just say women or men.
In short trans women are women and trans men are men. Calling them other things is generally not what they want.
I don't think trans femme is a thing, as anyone can be femme regardless of gender. Like, I don't think cis-femme is a thing. I'm guessing you mean to in clude non-binary people that look femme? You could just say femme people? Again femme identifying is weird and subtly implies they aren't actually femme.

Text:   So, at the root of your argument, you could never be attracted to a trans woman because you believe deep down she's still a man. You cannot be an ally because any support you offer while you hold this belief is backhanded.
The most recent research points to the hormones we are exposed to during fetal development that assigns gender, while our genes express our physical sex. Those are two separate entities. Mentally, the individual is a specified gender assigned to the wrong body. Reassignment surgery is the correction of a mistake, and puts them the way they were meant to be. Your understanding of this topic is deeply flawed.

Text:   Oh, wow... umm...
1. The school year should extended to encompass all 12-months of the year.
2. Students must be allowed to fail. The general practice of curving grades has to stop. It is also not acceptable to push children onto the next grade level simply because of their age or the fact that you're sick of dealing with them. 
3. The attitude of "no child left behind" should be eliminated. Children should not be held back from learning in order to allow struggling students to keep up with the class. Group children into classes with students who require similar levels of support/guidance.
4. The material taught at each grade level should be introduced a year sooner (e.g. the topics current taught in grade 9 should be taught in grade 8).
5. Schools must have the authority to properly reward/punish children. Parents must be supportive of the school's decision (within reason) and reinforce it at home.
6. Parents and teachers must stop telling students they are "special", unique, and entitled.
7. Parents and teachers must stop telling students they are always right or never wrong. There is a correct answer to 1+1=?. You do not get credit because you were "close enough", "did your best", or are a "non-binary homosexual".
8. School curriculum must be adjusted to prioritize practical educational topics:  reading, writing, math, science, government, finance, economics, health, and other critical life skills. Art, Music, European/Asian history, foreign language, etc. are all great subjects, but the vast majority of population will never need nor use them.
9. Eliminate school pensions, unions, and other safety nets. Teachers should be paid well, but they must also be held accountable for their performance and accomplishments like any other job in the world. There are far too many teachers protected by unions who are unfit to be in the classroom. They need to be removed from the system and those who excel at their should receive more recognition and compensation.
10. Much tighter controls have to be placed on sports programs. They are an optional, extracurricular activity and should be treated as such. Only those students who excel in their coursework should be allowed to participate. Student with a C average in a class should not be allowed to participate.

> Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.
Non-binary people do not identify with their birth assigned sex and so are transgender. Non-binary people are not *binary* transgender people, and they may or may not medically transition but they are still transgender.
It is actually really important when you look at the historical development of the word that it includes non-binary people.  In fact, there was a time when the old word "transsexual" meant specifically binary trans people and if you said you were "transgender" people would assume you were non-binary.
The word is now used as an umbrella term because in general the trans community wants to support everyone with their individual gender journey, where people may not know if they will end up identifying as binary or not, and it is not good to produce social pressure that you must medically transition to be included.

Text:   We as progressives have failed to make young cis men feel welcome in our community, and we are losing them to reactionary ideologies. These cis men feel isolated from the society and rejected by this new progressive climate.
The reason for this is that we are not as charitable towards their complaints as we are towards the complaints of marginalized groups. When we examine the problems of women and minoroties we always look at it trough the lens of the societal dynamics, which I agree is the correct way to look at it. But it seems that when cis men complain about similar issues progressives forget about that perspective and suddenly use libertarian arguments of personal responsibility.
Imagine a trans man complaining about how he has trouble on the dating scene because of his femminine features, the progressive community will acnkowlege his complaint as a manifestation of societies problematic views on masculinity. However when a cis man (incel) complains about the same thing they are being told not to feel entitled and to "take a shower" or "hit the gym" and other allusions to personal responsibility. I don't think this is fair.
I think we can acknowledge both privileges and disadvantages of cis men and adress them separately, just because their communities tend to be toxic doesn't mean their complaints aren't valid. As an example ethnic minority groups tend to have problems with homophobia, but we don't dismiss their struggles just because their groups have toxic aspects to it.
I do not blame progressives for this either, these are polarizing times and its easy to fall into us vs them mindset, and to be on the defensive when a privileged group raises complaints.
We need to find a way to make progressivism more appealing to cis men, otherwise more and more of them will fall for reactionary bullshit. This is no easy task, the right ideologies have always offered simple but false solutions to problems. It's easier to blame women and brown people on your problems than to go in depth explaining social dynamics of patriarchy. But we can begin by listening to them and offering compassion first, and then explain how their problems stem from toxic masculinity and patriarchy, and that progressive values are a means to solve their problems.

You were asking about issues with a 1 person, 1 vote national popular vote, so I provided some. And some systems DEFINITELY advantage small parties more than others, so that part is false.
>Also, you're using irrational fears to backup your myth. The majority doesn't want any of those things. The majority wants healthcare, marriage, equal rights for gay and transgender people, better pay, things like that.
Lol, the point of the concept and of my examples wasn't to fear monger. The point is to illustrate that what the majority wants isn't inherently the best thing. What if the majority of people wanted to invade Russia sometime over the past two years?? That seems a lot more believable.
The things you list are also incredibly vague, which brings up another great critique of direct democracy: average citizens aren't competent enough to make these decisions.
>And yes, the states did agree to all of this as a part of their statehood. They also agreed to a process by which the system could change, which is what we're trying to bring attention to here.
Fair, but that shouldn't be this compact bogus. I also think this is a bad idea for Dems to push this anti-EC stuff if you're thinking purely strategically, which you seem to claim that you're not, but I'm skeptical of that.

Is it possible for me to cope with how society treats men? Should I just give up? 
The current gender roles of men and women suck for a lot of people, and since I can't even fathom a future where I can live as a woman, I can only see a future where I'm miserable as a man. 
I'm basically transitioning into one of the "sadboys". I don't know the answer either.

Text:   They're right.  A male dating a male is a homosexual relationship despite how one might identify.  Just how a transman dating excusively females is technically homosexual.  Surgery is all cosmetic, and a neovagina is not a real vagina.

Text:   I'd say that depends entirely on whether you believe transwomen are "real" women. It's clear that you don't. I disagree, but the chances of either of us convincing the other on the internet are so low as not to be worth it. 
So, with that in mind, I get why you don't see it as strictly heterosexual. Seeing things a certain way is your right, of course, as long as you don't go around telling transgender people our their partners what their "actual" sexuality is. Which unfortunately is a weirdly common activity, for some reason.

Text:   > You don't need gender identity or anything to explain the specific brand of dysphoria typical to trans people.
So then go ahead: If you don’t think your genitals are abnormal, and you don’t think they should be otherwise because you’re the gender opposite your sex, then what, exactly, is your issue?

Post:   I have been working on my coming out letter, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback
Text:   Congrats on taking this big step! 
I’m not trans so I’m not sure I’m allowed to comment. 
I used to have a totally incorrect idea of what it actually meant to be trans, and when someone took the time to explain it to me, it actually made a lot of sense. I previously had no idea that gender identity was a biological part of our neurology. I thought it was more of a “choice” like you said, so I think you did a great job explaining it.
>	So, as someone who was assigned male at birth (AMAB) **but is actually female**, I am a trans woman.
In the past, if I had read something like that, I would’ve kind of blown that part off. I would’ve said that sounds more like an opinion that scientific, but that’s because I didn’t know all of the science behind how transwomens brain imaging looks like ciswomens brains, (and same for transmen & cismen) and all the rest of it.
I only bring this up because if you are giving this to anyone who thinks like I used to, that part might not be taken seriously it’s read before all the good information you give. Maybe if you moved that sentence to the end of the letter, it might be more effective?
I hope this comment is okay and I’m sorry for giving feedback if I wasn’t supposed to. Good luck! You’re very brave and I hope it goes well for you.

Text:   I’ve been typing and retyping so many variations of commenting on how you’re both a massive faggot and wholly asexual at the same time for several minutes now, but I can’t find the words to articulate the incomprehensible scope of both things. This is amazing. You’ve somehow managed to be so utterly neutered that it manages to offend senses that words on a screen can’t even impact.
Disgusting.

Text:   chasers have specific fetish for trans women though, hence why they are chasers. It not just men they want it’s the idea of “men who look like women” stuff like that. Besides the penis, a component to chaser fantasies seems to be the assumption that trans women have “male brains” stuff like that. This is reflected by the way they treat us and the things they ask us to do, chaser fantasies typically involves trans women taking very masculine roles.

Text:   That's true enough--the sex experience with a trans woman who has not had SRS would certainly be different. But there's lots of ways sex can be different without labeling it as "no longer straight." 
I concluded you didn't think trans women were real women, because a man sleeping with a woman is the definition of hetero. So if a man is sleeping with a partner and you don't believe it's heterosexual, that means you don't believe the partner is entirely a woman. I could have misinterpreted your point somewhere. Where might it have happened? 
For the record, I haven't been downvoting you. I know karma doesn't matter, but I also get how the person you're talking to downvoting you can feel like hostility, and so I wanted to point out that hasn't been me. I appreciate that you haven't been, either.

Trans women are men who think they are women although biologically they aren't.

Post:   Are we compelled to change our names?
Text:   I’m also transmasculine (agender) and had a mostly unisex name from birth. I moved my first name to the middle and added my father’s first name in front, so my whole name is pretty clearly masculine but I still go by my middle name primarily. My birth name was actually pretty hilarious as it was 3 gender-neutral names that are common as both first and last names.
I know at least one binary trans woman who kept her unisex birth name. It’s definitely not unheard of.
