**Resources:**

In addition to the stuff I've already posted, here's what I've got:

I really like the YouTubers [Angel and Nicole](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6LR2z3l3MnHD1Sr7rbTUbg)and their organization [TheOneFrontier](https://www.theonefrontier.com/resources).  They've got a lot of vlogs about LGBT stuff and their website has a bunch more resources that they like.  Someday they'd like to build an LGBT Christian Youth Retreat.

[Here's an article about trans stuff from a Catholic perspective](https://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201805/transgender-and-catholic-31392).

I know I mentioned [GayChurch.org](https://www.gaychurch.org/homosexuality-and-the-bible/the-bible-christianity-and-homosexuality/) above but they really do have a ton of articles and stuff.  I'd highly recommend spending time just wondering around their site.

[HopeRemains](http://hoperemainsonline.com/) is a site with Catholic-focused resources.

[Jessica Kellgren-Fozard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhADVL2AiGX9WxOo6w6QbkRdCBX97Bkgh) is a deaf British lesbian YouTuber who is Quaker and has several videos devoted to what Quakerism is and how it handles LGBT people.  IIRC, she talks about how they were one of the first Christian Denominations to affirm LGBT people.

[This is a tumblr that has a lot of good stuff](https://queerchristianaffirmations.tumblr.com/faq).  Note especially the chat groups for LGBT Christians at the bottom of that page.

Also if you're on Tumblr I recommend following [QueerlyChristian](https://queerlychristian.tumblr.com/).  It's a blog that provides a lot of support and perspectives on Queer Christian stuff and they run a podcast about transgender christian stuff (Blessed be the Binary Breakers).  (side note: I've not listened to the podcast so while I recommend the tumblr, I cannot comment on the quality of the podcast but if it's as good as their tumblr, it'll be good).

**My Beliefs**

Now that the more official stuff is out of the way, here is how I personally reconciled LGBT people and Christianity.  I use the word ""Affirming"" a lot and it's important to note the difference between someone ""Accepting"" LGBT people and ""Affirming"" them (and don't even get me started on ""tolerance"").  ""Acceptance"" is what you do at the end of grieving.  You *accept* a loss.  You *accept* the death of a loved one.  Someone who is accepting is someone who says ""Well, I still don't like it but since I realize there's nothing I can do about it, I suppose I can welcome you into my home and be friendly with you and whatnot.  But really, if given the opportunity, I would change the situation.""  Someone who is *Affirming* is someone who celebrates your identity.  Someone who loves you *because* of who you are instead of in spite of it.  An affirming parent might say ""Oh you're gay?  Alright, do you have a girlfriend?"" (or boyfriend if you're a dude).

Also, when I mention ""Christian Doctrine"" I mean ""Christian Doctrine"" as I understand it.  There are thousands of different types of Christianity each with doctrine just a little different than all the others.  It should also be noted that once someone has made up their mind about something, it can take a long time to change it if they ever change it.  Anyone with Christian loved ones should not expect to shout theology at them and expect them to rationally and instantly decide that they're a-okay with the gay (or trans).

Backstory: I was Christian long before I realized I was trans.  I had not been raised in the church, but had a general understanding of what Christianity was because my parents took us to Christmas Eve services with my grandparents and when I was 15 made the decision to be baptized and come to Christ.  The church I attended was (and as far as I know still is) *extremely* conservative.  While they were technically non-denominational, their views lined up very closely with Southern Baptist and Evangelical beliefs.  This is the environment that my faith was born into and like a sponge it absorbed *all of it*.  I'm ashamed at the views I used to have and worse be vocal about.

During college I started to loosen up and slowly drift left.  I used to say I was far-right but ten years ago ""far-right"" meant something different than it does now.  Lets put it this way:  I don't know that I *would* have voted for Trump but I also don't know that I *wouldn't* have and that scares me.  Luckily, that young man doesn't vote any more (lol can you imagine if he could see the lesbian he would someday become).  (I'm not going to go into detail about how and why I stopped being conservative b/c it's a long story that's not super important right now).

I actually became LGBT affirming before I realized I was LGBT myself.  I was pretty against same-sex marriage until one day when I was driving to church and I heard a program on the radio where a guy would host a radio show as Jesus.  It isn't as weird as it sounds, it was mostly a place where people would call in for prayers and the show made it clear that it was for artistic reasons and the host in no way actually believed he was the risen Christ.

Anyway, his argument was basically that there was no reason that Christians shouldn't support secular same-sex marriage rights if their only argument was that God wouldn't bless those marriages.  He asked the audience if they believed that marriages between atheists, Muslims, Buddhists, etc were blessed and if not, they either needed to campaign against those too or not worry about same-sex marriage.  From there I slowly started to realize that God probably doesn't condemn homosexuality.  There's a lot of stuff online about how the places in Leviticus and Romans that damn homosexual behavior are probably mistranslated (a better translation would probably be pedophilia) but you can look those up on your own (they're in the resources I've listed).  For me, Galatians 3:28 overrides any condemnation of gay love:

>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Becoming gay-affirming primed me to become trans-affirming.  At that point I was like, yeah okay, God probably doesn't have any problem with it so I won't either.  I didn't ever get any more specific than that until my egg cracked and I started wondering how and why God would make me or anyone else trans if only to condemn the idea of people transitioning.

Christian doctrine teaches that the universe was once perfect but sin entered the world when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (I'm not a creationist but we can talk about how evolution and whatnot fit with the doctrine of Original Sin some other time).  At that point, sin entered the universe and corrupted *everything.*  It didn't just corrupt our relationship with God.  It seeped into our bones and into our genes.  It changed the way we interact with the ground we walk on.  When Christians talk about ""Sin"" in a theological sense, it isn't just a verb (""sin"" is not just something someone does that is bad).  Sin-the-noun I think would be best described as an evil version of the Force from Star Wars.  It exists all around us and we wade through it daily.

My belief is that God created our souls and that sin corrupted our bodies once we were conceived.  I don't know if God creates souls gendered or not.  Maybe God creates male, female, and other gendered souls and then sin mutates the body into something the soul doesn't fit into and thus you get dysphoria.  Maybe God doesn't create gendered souls and dysphoria comes from somewhere else.  I don't know.  There's a lot I don't know.

But I know one thing: God loves us.  Every one of us.  Any Christian who disagrees is letting their own biases get in the way of that.

> this proposal is intended to make clear that the Executive Order 11246 religious exemption covers not just churches but employers that are organized for a religious purpose, hold themselves out to the public as carrying out a religious purpose, and engage in exercise of religion consistent with, and in furtherance of, a religious purpose.

This proposal is meant to allow religious organizations to hire based on their practices. It's not like the manager at McDonald's who doesn't like gay people is going to be able to fire people just like that.

> Not just trying, succeeding. Started by banning trans people from the military

Trans people were banned from the military because of the high rate of depression, suicide, and the fact that hormone therapy can cause unpredictable mood changes and other health problems.

As someone who just recently went through the process of joining the military, I can tell you they have barred people for much more trivial reasons than that.

> undoing healthcare regulations that protected lgbt people from discrimination, rolling back obama era protections for trans students, trying to define transgender out of existence, pressuring independent non-profit youth organization 4-H to withdraw their pro-LGBT policy, filling courts with anti-LGBT, anti-abortion judges, filling his cabinet with anti-lgbt people, fired everyone in the HIV/AIDS council, list goes on.

Your bias is showing with this list. You refuse to learn how or why these are implemented and instead opt to misunderstand them in the most blatant and judgmental ways. Doctors can't refuse to fix a broken arm just because the patient is gay. However, a doctor can refuse to perform an abortion because they feel performing it would be immoral. [Source](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/final-conscience-rule.pdf). The Obama Admin guidance on Title IX was changed because of sexual assault, not trans students. Also, being called by the wrong pronoun is not a violation of your rights (I would know; when I was 10 I was called a girl a few times myself). Trump ""defining transgender out of existence""? Lol. That proposal simply refers to the word ""sex"", not ""gender"". It would legally define ""sex"" as the same thing it is usually defined as in the dictionary- the biological state of being male or female. ""Transgender"" would not be redefined out of existence, because the word ""gender"" is not being redefined.

The 4-H thing? Saying Trump did that is beyond a stretch. A chief-of-staff of the USDA (which is in charge of 4-H) under Sonny Perdue, Heidi Green, who is no longer employed with the USDA, who wasn't even appointed by Trump, requested a piece of 4-H's new guidance regarding LGBT members be removed. How this equates to ""Trump rolling back on LGBT rights"" is beyond me.

I mean until now I thought that's what your bold and incorrect claims were about. Anyways, what does abortion have to do with LGBT rights?

And does the list go on? I don't think it does. At the end there you really started to grasp at straws.

> Ted Cruz was introduced at his rally by a ""kill the gays"" pastor.

Ted Cruz isn't ""the majority of right wingers"". Also, again, ""Ted Cruz is homophobic because some other dude is homophobic"". I don't buy it.

> The christian taliban is a part of the trump admin.

Last I checked the Trump Administration wasn't trying to institute theocracy. Also the vast majority of Christians don't condone terrorism in any form, let alone ""in the name of God"", unlike Islam, which also says homosexuality should be punished (along with condoning pedophilia). Trump doesn't even go to church regularly, so the notion that he's some sort of Christian extremist is just bogus.

> Israel doesn't even have inter-religious marriage, let alone gay marriage. It has an official state religion, sharia courts, laws based on religion, religious schools funded by the state, and a racist colonial policy of subsidizing illegal settlements on occupied land, justified by religious lunacy.

Israel doesn't perform same-sex marriages, but it recognizes gay marriages performed elsewhere and condones homosexuality in virtually every other issue. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Israel). Israel also respects freedom of religion and freedom of speech. They certainly aren't a perfect country, but if you would prefer the Palestine Authority, who literally persecutes people for being homosexual, that makes *you* the homophobe, not me.

> But I *would* discriminate. I absolutely would not trust a creationist doctor for example. Of course religious fundamentalists do not belong in positions of power, public or private.

ey17zak,"Could you elaborate on what exactly would be the difference between the mental based and the physical based versions, and how you think they should be treated differently?

As far as I know most of my dysphoria focused on my body, that I wanted to be physically male and was very uncomfortable with being bio female. I was bothered by being seen as a woman socially, but that was always secondary. I liked being feminine and usually brushed off ""misgendering"" etc, although it annoyed me. Sure I wanted to be socially recognised as a man, but it was ultimately far less important to me than having a male body or at least appear as close to it as medically possible. I wanted a flat chest, narrow hips, deep voice, facial hair, body hair, male genitals, etc. I never confused masculinity for maleness or femininity for femaleness as I grew up with a very masculine mother and slightly effeminate father, and my being a lesbian and my denial of it actually had very little to do with why I thought I was trans and ended up living as an effeminate gay/bi trans man. 

My point is all that was driving me to transition was my hatred of my femaleness and my wish to appear physically male. I did end up medically and socially transitioning to a trans man, then detransitioning and re-identifying back to a woman. The treatment I needed all along was therapy for my past traumas, which was the source of my dysphoria. Alas, transitioning was not what I needed.

I have on occasion read body-focused dysphoria described as ""sex dysphoria"" but it's very commonly accompanied by social dysphoria also sometimes referred to as ""gender dysphoria"", cause they like overlap really a lot and tend to exacerbate each other. Even I who was at core sex dysphoric and not truly happy in living as a man, got gender/social dysphoria over time which was then exacerbated by my sex dysphoria. They were very intertwined. I've rarely ever heard of people who have/had sex dysphoria without thinking they're trans at all or had no amount of social dysphoria. Although I think that's surely possible, I don't think it's common at all. However it seems much more common to have social dysphoria but no sex dysphoria accompanying it. 

So, in my highly uneducated opinion on this complicated topic... I don't think they can be truly separated for a lot of, if not most, dysphoric people. The brain and the body are connected. Psycho-therapy can treat body/sex dysphoria just like it can treat gender/social dysphoria, based on my own experience. However I'm not against people choosing to medically transition as a way to alleviate their dysphoria. Although I'm not a fan of it and it clenches my gut, I won't butt in on anyone's personal choices about their own bodies. I'd gain nothing from doing so.

I don't think trying to separate sex dysphoria from social dysphoria entirely would even be possible. They're two sides of the same coin, and I think that coin of any dysphoria related to sex, gender, gender roles, etc, is a complex psychological condition with a lot of different possible causes; ranging from peer pressure to hormone imbalances and abuse, and much more. Additionally, I think how it's best to be treated depends on what caused it for each individual person who has it.",trans man,detrans,r/detrans | Detransition Subreddit,reddit.com/r/detrans/comments/cuy8hs/does_this_sound_like_a_possible_solution/ey17zak/

I mean it takes an awful lot to turn against a minority, it honestly does.  If this same hate

was displayed by cis men in anyway they would have been thrown under the bus and condemned as a hate group long ago.  

So while their movement of feminist purity is falling apart rapidly especially after aligning with Christian right and other groups who have hated lgbt since the dawn of time.  It's like they are isolating themselves further every single day.

Meantime, the trans movement, even with the push back is growing daily.  Gender clinics are overflowing with people who are finally not afraid to admit what gender they are on the inside.  They are transitioning earlier, and in greater and greater numbers they are becoming stealth unless they out themselves, undetectable,  and blend without a hint of maleness  or femaleness after their mtf, or ftm transition.  

they can hate all they want, trans is growing for one simple reason.

ey1lhoi,"For the sake of argument, let's imagine that, everywhere,  transgender individuals were **banned** from using bathrooms that match their gender self-identify:

* In this scenario, would it prevent straight, cis persons from entering a bathroom that does not match their gender? **No**.
* Would it prevent cis persons from acting as peeping toms in bathrooms (whether it matches their gender or not)? **No**.
* Would it prevent cis persons from indecently exposing themselves to others in bathrooms (whether it matches their gender or not)? **No**.
* Would it prevent cis persons from sexually assaulting others in bathrooms (whether it matches their gender or not)? **No**.

So, considering that a vanishingly small number of trans persons would enter a bathroom matching their gender self-identify for any reason other than to use it for it's designated purpose (as is also the case with the overwhelming majority of cis persons), it doesn't seem to me that any greater danger than current exists is created by allowing them to do so. If a trans person did need to disrobe while in the bathroom, I would hazard to guess that they would use a stall, like most people.

However, if a cis person pretending to be trans entered a bathroom that did not match their gender, the issue would begin the moment they began to take some inappropriate or illegal action (peeping into stalls, indecent exposure, sexual assault, etc). Which is exactly the same situation for a trans or  cis  person using a bathroom that matches their gender self-identity.

Also, if ""actual fascist"" applies to ""those who believe in the political and social supremacy of straight white people"" then many progressives/leftists are just fascists with guilty consciences.

Furthermore, Nick Griffin of the British National Party gave a speech in 1999 to American friends of the BNP, giving examples of what he called ""saleable"" language, such as ""instead of saying racial purity, talk about identity"", and went on to explain that the way to power (and therefore more overt white supremacism) would be through selling their ideas rather than selling them out.

>Didn't use cis Christian, or patriarchy

Fascists do seek to exterminate LGBT+ people, and believe that women should primarily be homemakers as well as subordinate to men. They do believe in a patriarchal society.

Fascists' ultimate goal is to purge non-whites, Jews, LBGT+ people, disabled people, and non-fascists from their country. 

>Mussolini...ultimate form of socialism

This was a deliberate ruse by fascists to gain support from socialists. Hitler did it to, that's why his party was the ""National Socialist German Worker's Party""

>Member when..

I don't know what you're referring to. The left opposes war with Iran and isn't whining about ""transgender soldier medical bills"", and opposes the military-industrial complex. There's even those on the left who believe that states should dismantle their militaries and put the money towards better purposes.

>Libertarians are opposed to...

I know they say they are, but I'm saying the corporations and the wealthy will use fascism as a last resort to protect their wealth. They're willing to sign over control of their business to the state so long as it's profitable.

To be honest, I'm still ignorant on the details myself. From the word used to describe it, it's another supercategory under which agender, genderfluid, etc., fit under, and as such a different word entirely should be used for the specific experience of having a gender yet it not fitting ""masculine"" or ""feminine"".

But that's not what it's used for, and I honestly haven't had the energy to do research on it when I'm dealing with my *own*, different gender issues, so I have no idea how one would even distinguish it.

Again, it would require somehow distilling a definition for ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" that doesn't simply boil down to ""me macho man -- me has power, me smash those who disagree wit me"" and ""I'm a sophisticated as fuck lady who enjoys social or skill-based games over games of strength"". Both of which definitions are demonstrably silly.

Fuck gender as a philosophical construct, it's both an unnecessary entity and leads to completely ridiculous conclusions! *bleurgh* Let me have my long hair and goes-spinny skirt and leave me alone, dangit...

Of course, in a few days or less I'm sure I'll be right back to ""I'm a woman, and I'm not going to roar for your amusement, leave me alone, dangit"".

Any important note, there were a significant number of AFAB women above 2.0 nmol/L due to pcos, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reality is that current medical guidelines for appropriate care of transgender individuals puts an upper bound on testosterone in trans women lower than the empirically observed upper bound of cis women (even when treating women with pcos, etc. as outliers). Further, because spironolactone (the main testosterone blocker used in the US), doesn't actually block testosterone directly but via competitive inhibition (it competes to bind to the same receptor as testosterone wants to), the serum testosterone levels observed in trans women are higher than the effective testosterone levels. In simpler terms, because the error exists in a downward direction, trans women (on spiro) have even lower effective testosterone than their levels show.",transgender,GenderCritical,"Coming up this September: University of Montana TIM will destroy women's athletics as his 800m, 1500m, 5000m are 5-20s better than NCAA women's record",https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cuok7h/coming_up_this_september_university_of_montana/ey1osit/

So I have this friend we will call her Mildred. She is so sweet and such a kind hearted girl except I feel uncomfortable around her and it is not because of her being transgender lemme just tell you that right now. Since I’ve known her, Mildred has asked me out three times and the two times we’ve hung out she’s hit on me like I would say “Oh I dropped a napkin. Sorry” and she’d say “don’t apologize. It’s cute” in like a tone and it made me a little uncomfortable which is awful and I feel awful. Lately I’ve been starting to feel weird about hanging out especially because we don’t have that much to talk about because every time I say something she interrupts with how beautiful and amazing I am—which ain’t bad lmao Im just not used to that much attention from others. I postponed our hangout and she confronted me because she always says I saw you hanging with that person on Snapchat when are we going to hang out? I want to tell her the truth but not only do I not know how, I feel like she will think it’s because she is trans or something. Just FYI if I had a guy friend who was like this all the time I would feel the same way so that is not the case but I feel like shit and even a bigot. WIBTA for telling her about my discomfort?

The Eurocopter Tiger is a modern day attack helicopter, which came to being through a joint Franco-German development project, starting back in the mid 1980s. Soon, the Tiger will become available to all French and German pilots with the release of update 1.91 and will be among the first rank VII helicopters coming to War Thunder!Development on what would eventually become the Eurocopter EC665 began as early as 1984, following the issuing of a joint set of requirements by West Germany and France for a new type of multi-role combat helicopter. Although initial development was plagued by various political and economical problems leading to the effective cancellation of the project in 1986, unwavering interest in the development from both sides led to the relaunch of the project in November 1987. Largely unaffected by the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, development of the Eurocopter EC665 entered its final stages, with the first prototype conducting its maiden flight in April 1991. Following successful testing, the first orders for the EC665 were issued by both Germany and France in 1999. The first production model rolled off the assembly line in 2002, with subsequent units entering service in the coming years. To date, 135 Tigers have been produced with production still ongoing.The Eurocopter Tiger is coming to player hangars with the release of the upcoming update 1.91 and will become one of the first rank VII helicopters to arrive in War Thunder. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned to the news for all the latest developments regarding the next major update coming to the game. Until then, clear skies pilots!﻿Check out the full Dev Blog atricle here!

It's not a waste of time, it's a discussion on whether the two points offered were sufficient qualities to define whether a form of marriage should be supported.  That you seem to want to have an argument about your own theories is a hobby that I encourage you to pursue.  But that's your thing.


>> Rich guys marry young girls, and they sign pre-nups cause they're young and dumb and desperate. It happens already.

> Sorry, are you acting like that's adding new information here? I already pointed out the fact that there are minimum standards in existing marriage agreements and how those routinely get overturned thanks to protections for spouses. There are some rights that can't be signed away. But until you have a functioning model of how polygamous marriages will actually work in practice, you can't actually just assume the same protections can be carried over.

Yes I can, that's how assumptions work.  

>> It works? That's debatable when half of marriages fail, and there's an entire industry of lawyers that make their living off the likelihood of marriages failing.

> That's irrelevant to the issues I've highlighted. I'm not talking about the relationships themselves, I'm talking about the legal protections in the institution. You're trying to change the subject here.

No, your point just does't hold.  

> > Men expelled from the community?

> Yes, that is a consequence found in polygamous societies.  How that would play out in Canada could take a lot of forms, but considering it's a common issue that appears in every society where polygamy is common, it's a real danger you have to acknowledge.

No I don't.  This is not the 4th century, and having children out of wedlock has next to no social ramifications for most of western society.  

>> ""Specific harms with an observed relationship to that institution""? That sounds a lot like marriage, when half of them fail and cause a lot of harm to the participants.

> No, that's not even a little bit similar.

Yes, it really is.

>> Without some sort of quantification, this seems like we've reached a dead end here. There's no data available, so you're reaching back to times when ""excommunication from the community"" meant something.

> I'm talking about real examples that exist in the present day, you're wrong.

You're talking about theocratic sects and pretending that excommunication is a social force in the west.  You're not talking about anything that applies to the contemporary west.

>> The ""society isn't ready yet"" argument could have been made to say that blacks and whites shouldn't marry.

> No, again, that's not remotely comparable. That was a problem where the ONLY problems were related to discrimination itself. The problems with polygamy happen, on the other hand, when it's widely accepted. That's completely different and comparing the two is a complete mistake on your part.

No, it's the exact same thing.  A complaint that the marriage system would produce too many inequalities due to other pre-existing inequalities, therefor extending the group of people who are allowed to enter into it must be restricted.

The idea of becoming trans revolves around wanting to be a desired gender identity. Non-binary identities are a minority but are still a welcome thing.

ey1wmc3,"I’m yet to see satisfactory evidence for the change in the DSM, as well as the stance of Medical Organisations, with respect to changing best practise for transgender individuals. 

Take Anorexia Nervosa, for example, where people believe they have a much higher body fat than they actually do. Mental Health specialists don’t listen to their beliefs of their “true body”, and therefore create a diet and exercise plan to help them lose weight. These specialists, instead, address their mental health. 

This is not being done for Transgender individuals, and those that are saying “it doesn’t work” are pulling the trigger far too early on that statement. It takes years of experimentation (for lack of a better word) for clinical guidelines to be developed for adequate and effective therapy. 

Making permanent bodily changes, especially to children, is too drastic a treatment for what little evidence we have. 

An angle that I’ve not seen deeply explored, is the high rates of depression associated with transgender individuals. It’s seen as a result of their transgenderism, but perhaps it could be the other way around; socially isolated people that were previously just “a bit different” or your standard “tomboy girl” or “effeminate boy” develop depression as a result of their inability to fit in with social groups, plus any potential bullying, and then jump to a conclusion that the reason for this is an incorrect body, instead of being accepting of their differences and uniqueness as an individual. 

Not an expert in mental health, though. But I’m familiar with evidential standards for medical practise, and it just isn’t there.

ey2062q,"Sincere question: Aside from a person's sex which refers to a person's biological sexual functions and genetics, why is it important to label these other things? Why do we need to label people based on who they're attracted to? Why do we need to label how people like to dress or act? Why do we need to put a label on how a person identifies as? It seems to me that it's just putting more of a divide. Listen, if you're biologically a male, meaning you have male genitalia, male chromosomes and male DNA, then medically and legally, you're a male. You're free to love either a male or female, you're free to dress as a man or as a woman, you're free to act like a man or a woman. Why do we need to complicate it with so many labels?

The privacy of a bathroom is one thing. But what about locker rooms where some times women choose to change clothes in the open secured by the fact that everyone in the room is a woman? What if I, a straight male, claim that I identify as a woman and DEMAND my right to use this woman's locker room?

What about the woman's sauna? Can I, a straight man, pretend to identify as a woman and DEMAND my right to use the woman's sauna along with the other naked women? Nevermind that my balls are hanging out due to the heat, never mind that my dick's hard because of the sight of the other naked, I can just claim to identify as a woman and DEMAND to be allowed there? No, right? So where do we draw the line? Because like it or not, a line has to be drawn somewhere.",i identify as,Philippines,"I am part filipina.

&#x200B;

I am pretty sure that I recognized that I did not like being forced to act tough, that as much as I could hate myself for not being like all the other boys, I also liked myself enough to hate the system that made me feel that way. Which is why I kind of fell towards feminism, girls were generally kinder to me, and I kind of like a bit of femininity, no joke partially because I was a Virgo, something I understood as such and no one could really say that I should not have. Of course I always played the part of a gentleman, was raised that way, but I was also curious enough to listen that many females as much did not like boys acting like a gentleman to get what they deserve. I kind of went into it while thinking that I could ask for the freedoms of oppression of being expected of being manly, something I came to understand was called toxic masculinity. So, seeing how women were oppressed by things, I thought that I could follow it and say they too are trying to help men.  

Not saying that I was perfect over everything. I think that I for quite some time continued to have weird thoughts on gay people, probably from how prevalent the term was used as a slur that I absolutely wanted to avoid as to not think everyone was against me. And you can imagine what my thoughts were on trans people, where as far as I knew, they were fakes, and a threat against me accidentally becoming gay, which I was told was the worst thing ever, that I could never shake. Things did start to change when I started to see positive representation, things that showed gay people were not monsters, that there was not really any choice other than being who they were, and it was not okay to make fun of them for who they were, just as much as I did not like what was done to me.  

But Natalie, Natalie honestly did some awakening shit on me, whether maybe I was already thinking certain things about acceptance, Natalie introduced me to ""the trans issue"". I am pretty sure a lot of things still made me feel uncomfortable, things like drag queens still made me feel uncomfortable, and I think that I still felt like things like transgender people were maybe a little wrong. But everything done in a fun and or honest way, I think that I started to look inward. I don't want to be accused of being in some sort of phase, doing something just to be cool, but there were fact and thoughts that matched things I had been thinking for a long time. In school, when I felt especially alienated for who I was (and after), I would sometimes wonder if things would have been if I was a girl, and there was something enticing about the scenario. Things like anime where a boy suddenly turned into a girl kind of felt like really interesting plots, and maybe something I would want to happen.  

Honestly don't have any concrete answers to myself right now, I think so many things are mixed up in my head that I don't know if I am just looking at the new fun thing I could call myself, or if I was maybe traumatized by things that I can't see the answers to who I am inside. As much as I see how people see the ideas of things like multiple genders as ridiculous, where you could say that people might as well just say that they are helicopters, my current thoughts are that I might be something like non-binary. I think that I feel mostly like a boy, I act like, feel fine being referred to as ""he"", and are happy with the comfortable clothes while not thinking that I won't be the true me if I don't put on a dress. In some ways I feel like I would be kind of fine if some day I suddenly became a woman, and got to be pretty or rely on being emotional and caring, rather than being tough.  

I am probably still messed up. I often in situations let my voice naturally become more deep and commanding when I need a little ego boost. I can feel a kind of anger build up when my sister starts singing in a girly and pretty way, like I just want her to stop it and willing to give into a way that would have me come across as a misogynist. And I think that is some sort of jealousy, something that feels like it is doing actual pain to me as I would never be allowed to be that way. If I would even try I would likely fail, because girly wrong for a man, and even if I did maybe go down that path, I kind of feel like people would get the wrong idea, and would probably miss things that I have right now. It is being drawn two different ways, that I kind of wish that there could be two of me that I could be both. Pretty sure the middle ground if I even tried would totally not be attractive, and thus affirming. 

 And speaking of attractive, that too is kind of confusing. I am pretty sure gay men look at a hot guy and feel something, and I am pretty sure it is gals that get my motor running. And yet I do have thoughts of the likes when I admitted to a friend in high school of the girl I had a crush on, and he told me she looked like a boy. I like the naked lady pictures, but have not quite felt the attraction that most guys have to large breasts, the smaller ones often something pulling me. And although what  assume are hunky gay men are not really something that fully connects to me, I have more recently given into what I understand as an attraction with porn to, for lack of a more acceptable term, girls with dicks. To be completely honest, there have been times where I was with a male friend alone, and the thought popped into my head of what if I suddenly kissed them. But I think it isn't the same as how gay people just see a hot dude, it is still mostly the women I am into.  

I am pretty sure that I am confused, about whether I am a different gender, non-binary, or most men are like this, and acceptance of that inner woman would be the answer for true men rights. Let alone the other things of if I am something like bisexual, when it still does not quite feel comfortable to me like it is 50/50. Guess that I am still interested in there being others out there of being trapped in the space between the two different sides, whether it is universal, or I am really not just some kind of pervert.

ey213m7,"I'm a trans woman, not a trans man, but this is some kind of universally relevant stuff - You can very much mention things like deadnaming and misgendering without textually having the dead name in the piece and without actually using the incorrect pronouns. It's especially easy if the POV character doesn't know the deadname, or knows that it's incorrect. 

This was something I ran into a couple of times in my WIP, actually. My MC's girlfriend Luna is a trans woman, and there are a couple of flashbacks with scenes that take place before she was out, because they've been friends since they were kids. 

I handled it like this. It's from a flashback to the day they met, which is about six or seven years before Luna came out. 

>“Y-y-y-you l-looked l-lonely,” Luna said.     
>  
>“Who are you?” Kaliko asked.     
>  
>Luna told Kaliko her name - a different name from the one she used when she got older.   

And here's another mention later in that scene:

> “What'd you say your name was?” Kaliko asked. The tide ran over her feet and ankles, then receded.    
>  
> Luna repeated the name she didn't use.   

and near the end of that scene: 

> Somewhere far off in the distance, a woman called the name Luna didn't use.   

As long as the scene involving the deadname and misgendering and stuff isn't the scene the character is introduced to the MC in (like, in the present moment, them meeting), you could handle it like that. The deadnaming is clear, despite not being present in the text. 

You could handle misgendering in a similar way. That doesn't come up in my WIP, but I'd generally handle it like this (with it being based on the scenario you gave):

>""He isn't my son,"" the old man said, but he didn't say *he*.

ey21cie,"**Less Fancy Pop**

I thought that Anri's debut single, [オリビアを聴きながら](https://youtu.be/RB1WtldzQRY)\* (While Listening to Olivia [Newton John]) was a pretty big hit, but I guess it was much less popular than I thought.

Yousui Inoue's [少年時代](https://youtu.be/DsyhKIUS4_s)\* (Youth) is pretty well-known, as is [夢の中へ](https://youtu.be/Z1G6vOrCHlY) (Into the Dream). My personal favorites are [帰れない二人](https://youtu.be/D-Vx2NSCbRI) (Two Who Can't Go Home, though it's not made clear why they can't) and [青空、ひとりきり](https://youtu.be/JlgIZHVA1-g), both fantastic, albeit in completely different ways.

Anzen Chitai (Safe Zone) is technically a boy band, I guess, but a really good one. Koji Tamaki, the lead singer, has an amazing voice that manages to sound both strained and smoooooooth. [碧い瞳のエリス](https://youtu.be/LDiX4QJL-8U)\* (Eris in Blue Eyes), [恋の予感](https://youtu.be/NwCaUY4FPQ4)\* (Premonition of Love), [ワインレッドの心](https://youtu.be/8FkGsbPURC0)\* (Wine-Red Heart), and [好きさ](https://youtu.be/Ux7CBiOt7ZM)\* are all great. This is not an exhaustive list.

I don't know much about Yuko Otomo, but she's tearing it up in [傷心](https://youtu.be/-CXks0FMQ6o) (Heartbreak). I think this one's more of a cult classic. It doesn't show up in the yearly top 100, but it keeps showing up on YouTube for me.

I'm not a huge fan of Amin's (Takako Okamura and Haruko Kato) [待つわ](https://youtu.be/SPkPo-SVOyY)\* (I'll Wait), but including it for notability, as the #1 single of 1982. I prefer Takako Okamura's [夢をあきらまないで](https://youtu.be/T74R5wqW36M) (Don't Give Up on Your Dreams).

\#2 that same year was Hiroko Yakushimaru's [セーラー服と機関銃](https://youtu.be/9H4vJUZhsgw) (Sailor Suit and Machine Guns). It's a break-up song that has nothing to do with either of those things, and is in fact a retitled cover of Takao Kisugi's [夢の途中](https://youtu.be/fg9yTU7NxaA) (En Route to a Dream). Yakushimaru's version was used as the theme song in a movie of the same title about a schoolgirl (Japanese school girl's uniforms are modeled after and referred to as sailor suits) adopted by a Yakuza family (hence machine guns). Or something like that. I never saw it. Anyway, it got the movie's title for marketing purposes.

I think Saki Kubota was kind of a one-hit-wonder, but [異邦人](https://youtu.be/mG0PmyoHQJU)\* (Foreigner) was #2 for 1980, followed by Crystal King's [大都会](https://youtu.be/ADgZsoSzDp0)\* (Metropolis). Monta & Brothers' [Dancing All Night](https://youtu.be/adu4_yzQjes) was #1, but it just doesn't do much for me.

I'm not sure where to start with Yumi Matsutoya (née Arai). She's released like 40 albums, and is the best-selling solo female Japanese musician of all time. Apparently a fan survey picked [DESTINY](https://youtu.be/5yQAJjC9cYo), [守ってあげたい](https://youtu.be/VzIHlGx1mZo), [春よ来い](https://youtu.be/Wy-CSp_F6Rs) (Come, Spring), [恋人がサンタクロース](https://youtu.be/kSrje0jehnw) (My Boyfriend is Santa Claus), and [レフレインが叫んでる](https://youtu.be/0XepW_B7l2k) (The Refrain Cries Out) as the top 5. ""Come, Spring"" is my personal favorite. There's a certain sameness to most pop music Also notable: [時をかける少女](https://youtu.be/vBNMEv7YUF0) (The Girl Who Runs Through Time), the theme song to several different film and TV adaptations of a novel of the same name.

I should probably mention Shizuka Kudo. IMO she's never been a great singer, but she was carried to success by great songwriters, namely Tsugutoshi Goto and Miyuki Nakajima. Some of her hits were [黄砂に吹かれて](https://youtu.be/AJbI8e3b_II)\* (Blown in the Sands) (Nakajima's own recording of this absolutely blows it out of the water, but it's not on YouTube), [慟哭](https://youtu.be/0qmluOp2G4w) (Sob), and [恋一夜](https://youtu.be/UDQcuhwsW-E) (One Night of Love).

I feel like I remember hearing Misato Watanabe's [My Revolution](https://youtu.be/oOAum6HWX-o) a lot about five years ago, but I can't remember why. Fun song, though. Aside from that, I guess she's known for [悲しいね](https://youtu.be/gAk5HVZWV_8) (Isn't It Sad?) and [恋したっていいじゃない](https://youtu.be/XQczQS4OTwk) (It's Good to Have Loved). Yes, they do all kind of sound the same.

Chage and Aska were doing all right in the 80s, with their worst-charting single hitting 56, but they really blew up in the 90s, with 8 #1 singles and the rest in the top 5. I'm not that familiar with their work, but [SAY YES](https://youtu.be/Q9qAyt0G-jM), [LOVE SONG](https://youtu.be/_wvAzWIjKIg), and [On Your Mark](https://youtu.be/3Obh9kg6o_U) seem to be among the most well-known. Aska's [Cry](https://youtu.be/LgfYLyXA-6w) is a personal favorite of mine. Also, Chage recorded [二人の愛ランド](https://youtu.be/7iD07PS82Tg) (Lovers' Island) with Yuko Ishikawa for an Okinawan tourism campaign.

Inexplicably, that was Yuko Ishikawa's highest-charting single, followed by [Cinderella Summer](https://youtu.be/JKolNJo9nDA). despite gems like [Let Me Fly](https://youtu.be/40us50uhuJQ) and [ニールサイモンも読みかけのままで](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-YMdzYshbg) (A Half-Read Play by Neil Simon). This is one of the self-indulgent inclusions; no one I've mentioned her to has ever heard of her.

I'm not terribly familiar with Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi, but he seems notable. Wikipedia gives [乾杯](https://youtu.be/18oljDWKqBo) (Cheers), [とんぼ](https://youtu.be/Kbx4ITGuAGM) (Dragonfly), and [しあわせになろうよ](https://youtu.be/F5OtBKl0HVk) (Let's Be Happy) as his major hits.

Hiromi Ota's [木綿のハンカチーフ](https://youtu.be/4kavnmW3EqA)\* (Cotton Handkerchief) was a big hit, though I prefer [さらばシベリア鉄道](https://youtu.be/iRxPtumtFks) (Farewell, Trans-Siberian Railway).

Kozo Murashita's best known for [初恋](https://youtu.be/mQfEP9KSJt8)\* (First Love), and then maybe [踊り子](https://youtu.be/oChkL_Gb_AQ) (Dancer), but apparently his personal favorite was [ロマンスカー](https://youtu.be/ixnCt8hm8CE) (Romance Car, a type of train car equipped with forward-facing love seats instead of the bench seats lining the walls that are standard in local trains, or possibly a reference to the Odakyu Romance Car, a specific train line).",Tim,slatestarcodex,Friday Fun Thread For August 23 2019,https://reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/cuavtk/friday_fun_thread_for_august_23_2019/ey21cie/

I'm not a huge fan of Amin's (Takako Okamura and Haruko Kato) [待つわ](https://youtu.be/SPkPo-SVOyY)\* (I'll Wait), but including it for notability, as the #1 single of 1982. I prefer Takako Okamura's [夢をあきらまないで](https://youtu.be/T74R5wqW36M) (Don't Give Up on Your Dreams).

\#2 that same year was Hiroko Yakushimaru's [セーラー服と機関銃](https://youtu.be/9H4vJUZhsgw) (Sailor Suit and Machine Guns). It's a break-up song that has nothing to do with either of those things, and is in fact a retitled cover of Takao Kisugi's [夢の途中](https://youtu.be/fg9yTU7NxaA) (En Route to a Dream). Yakushimaru's version was used as the theme song in a movie of the same title about a schoolgirl (Japanese school girl's uniforms are modeled after and referred to as sailor suits) adopted by a Yakuza family (hence machine guns). Or something like that. I never saw it. Anyway, it got the movie's title for marketing purposes.

I think Saki Kubota was kind of a one-hit-wonder, but [異邦人](https://youtu.be/mG0PmyoHQJU)\* (Foreigner) was #2 for 1980, followed by Crystal King's [大都会](https://youtu.be/ADgZsoSzDp0)\* (Metropolis). Monta & Brothers' [Dancing All Night](https://youtu.be/adu4_yzQjes) was #1, but it just doesn't do much for me.

I'm not sure where to start with Yumi Matsutoya (née Arai). She's released like 40 albums, and is the best-selling solo female Japanese musician of all time. Apparently a fan survey picked [DESTINY](https://youtu.be/5yQAJjC9cYo), [守ってあげたい](https://youtu.be/VzIHlGx1mZo), [春よ来い](https://youtu.be/Wy-CSp_F6Rs) (Come, Spring), [恋人がサンタクロース](https://youtu.be/kSrje0jehnw) (My Boyfriend is Santa Claus), and [レフレインが叫んでる](https://youtu.be/0XepW_B7l2k) (The Refrain Cries Out) as the top 5. ""Come, Spring"" is my personal favorite. There's a certain sameness to most pop music Also notable: [時をかける少女](https://youtu.be/vBNMEv7YUF0) (The Girl Who Runs Through Time), the theme song to several different film and TV adaptations of a novel of the same name.

I should probably mention Shizuka Kudo. IMO she's never been a great singer, but she was carried to success by great songwriters, namely Tsugutoshi Goto and Miyuki Nakajima. Some of her hits were [黄砂に吹かれて](https://youtu.be/AJbI8e3b_II)\* (Blown in the Sands) (Nakajima's own recording of this absolutely blows it out of the water, but it's not on YouTube), [慟哭](https://youtu.be/0qmluOp2G4w) (Sob), and [恋一夜](https://youtu.be/UDQcuhwsW-E) (One Night of Love).

I feel like I remember hearing Misato Watanabe's [My Revolution](https://youtu.be/oOAum6HWX-o) a lot about five years ago, but I can't remember why. Fun song, though. Aside from that, I guess she's known for [悲しいね](https://youtu.be/gAk5HVZWV_8) (Isn't It Sad?) and [恋したっていいじゃない](https://youtu.be/XQczQS4OTwk) (It's Good to Have Loved). Yes, they do all kind of sound the same.

Chage and Aska were doing all right in the 80s, with their worst-charting single hitting 56, but they really blew up in the 90s, with 8 #1 singles and the rest in the top 5. I'm not that familiar with their work, but [SAY YES](https://youtu.be/Q9qAyt0G-jM), [LOVE SONG](https://youtu.be/_wvAzWIjKIg), and [On Your Mark](https://youtu.be/3Obh9kg6o_U) seem to be among the most well-known. Aska's [Cry](https://youtu.be/LgfYLyXA-6w) is a personal favorite of mine. Also, Chage recorded [二人の愛ランド](https://youtu.be/7iD07PS82Tg) (Lovers' Island) with Yuko Ishikawa for an Okinawan tourism campaign.

Inexplicably, that was Yuko Ishikawa's highest-charting single, followed by [Cinderella Summer](https://youtu.be/JKolNJo9nDA). despite gems like [Let Me Fly](https://youtu.be/40us50uhuJQ) and [ニールサイモンも読みかけのままで](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-YMdzYshbg) (A Half-Read Play by Neil Simon). This is one of the self-indulgent inclusions; no one I've mentioned her to has ever heard of her.

I'm not terribly familiar with Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi, but he seems notable. Wikipedia gives [乾杯](https://youtu.be/18oljDWKqBo) (Cheers), [とんぼ](https://youtu.be/Kbx4ITGuAGM) (Dragonfly), and [しあわせになろうよ](https://youtu.be/F5OtBKl0HVk) (Let's Be Happy) as his major hits.

Hiromi Ota's [木綿のハンカチーフ](https://youtu.be/4kavnmW3EqA)\* (Cotton Handkerchief) was a big hit, though I prefer [さらばシベリア鉄道](https://youtu.be/iRxPtumtFks) (Farewell, Trans-Siberian Railway).

Kozo Murashita's best known for [初恋](https://youtu.be/mQfEP9KSJt8)\* (First Love), and then maybe [踊り子](https://youtu.be/oChkL_Gb_AQ) (Dancer), but apparently his personal favorite was [ロマンスカー](https://youtu.be/ixnCt8hm8CE) (Romance Car, a type of train car equipped with forward-facing love seats instead of the bench seats lining the walls that are standard in local trains, or possibly a reference to the Odakyu Romance Car, a specific train line).",Tim,japanesemusic,Highly idiosyncratic overview of late Showa popular music (link dump),https://reddit.com/r/japanesemusic/comments/cv5xqq/highly_idiosyncratic_overview_of_late_showa/ey225h0/

ey22j09,">My definition of sex doesn’t include everyone because it doesn’t. 

very explanatory, this isn’t tautological at all and I am able to clearly understand the point you were trying to articulate.

>Being a woman isn’t all inclusive and neither is being a man. 

yeah that’s what I’m tryna say. you can’t fit everyone into 2 boxes. there’s 7 billion people on this planet, they’re not gonna all fit into either of these two boxes, there’s gonna be some variety in them

>Either you are or you aren’t.

but at what point do you draw the line? seriously, there becomes a point where the differences are so minuscule that it’s just silly to differentiate. what’s the checklist or percentage they need to be considered a woman? 100% ? 90% ? someone who was genetically considered 90% a man gave birth to a baby fairly recently. if its 90% do you not allow someone who is 89.9%? ~~an argument could be made that YOUR argument is really similar to that of the trial of Davis Knight, a guy who was tried for miscegenation laws in Mississippi during the 1970’s. basically, they wouldn’t let this guy marry a girl because he was 1/8th black. not only is it racist, it’s also dumb! what kinda arbitrary bullshit is that. they really weren’t gonna let someone who looked and was for all intents and purposes white marry someone who is also white?~~

you’re really abouta do the same thing huh, you really not gonna let someone be considered a woman for all or most intents and purposes because of one thing? two things? “yeah you aren’t considered a woman because of X” is just as silly as “ yeah you’re not considered a woman cause ~~ you’re 1/8th man~~ have different anatomy such as eyes” like? *wheres the fuckin line* it doesn’t even matter where it is because it’s arbitrary and no matter where you draw it some natural born women/people won’t even meet that standard. so therefore they are women or a very small percentage of people are “real” women (whatever that means)

>it isn’t decided or felt. And no, feelings don’t matter because feelings are temporary. 

A lot of trans people have gender dysphoria which is literally described as a persistent feeling of discomfort between the disconnect of their physical sex and their gender identity. if they don’t transition, they will always feel uncomfortable with themselves. so feelings aren’t temporary in some cases such as gender dysphoria and depression. cause even with meds and therapy people will still feel like shit. 

but if you wanna get technical they are temporary, but in the same way as everything is temporary. cause you are not consistently you, if you’ll allow me to get philosophical on you, millions of your cells are born and die every day. so tell me, when I send this message are you still the same person, a permanent entirely new one? a person loses their leg, “ well I guess that thing that was permanently attached to me that is no longer makes me human” 
nothing is permanent. there’s not one thing in this world that is permanent, you zoom back far enough in time and everything is temporary. the only consistent permanent thing would be that you die. not all feelings are temporary but if they are, they’re temporary in the same you, your cells, your leg, your house, and me all are temporary. temporary also doesn’t mean they can’t last a long ass time. as people with gender dysporhia and depression can attest to, some people feel miserable for decades and die that way, so it is “temporary”.

Also feelings matter, *like a lot*. They’re not everything but they’re not nothing either.  It’s the difference between clinical depression and depression the mood. it’s the difference between a regular person and a sociopath (defined as someone without emotions) and it is all the difference for some people’s jobs such as therapy, counseling, teaching, customer service, it’s the difference in how you define your day, etc. feelings influence everything Spock, they’re what make us human and more than animals.

>They aren’t physical, they aren’t definite. Who is to decide how a woman feels or a man feels? A man or woman can take whatever hormones they want but it doesn’t change their sex. A man can present as a woman, conform to female gender norms, but they will always be a man.

yuh I agree. they’re “”really”” their assigned sex at birth but that’s on the most technical of levels. that’s their sex. not their gender. In everyday life we are not on that level. It’s just that when they look like a woman, talk like a woman, behave and interact like a woman, use the same hormones as a woman, use the same clothes, have the same voice, and relate to generally female experiences, they are pretty much a women. saying they aren’t because of one small thing is a kind of a gatekeeping dick move  (reminder that racists use similar or same logic to justify certain people as not human) and really dumb. referring to someone as a man when they look and act as a girl as much as possible just ends causing more confusion. just call them what they want or usually what they look like. who gives a shit if they aren’t a “real” one. the worlds not gonna end if someone doesn’t refer to someone as their original sex. just let them be",gender identity,clevercomebacks,I feel bad for ben,https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/cuz8tt/i_feel_bad_for_ben/ey22j09/

You're given cross-sex hormones on-demand at first meeting after self-diagnosis within 30 mins, sometimes without even a blood test. As a minor. (First-person account of an ex-FTM I follow on Twitter). In the US, Planned Parenthood is doing this, without doctors. This is called the affirmation protocol. If you say you might have gender dysphoria but ask for talk therapy, say you *don't* want surgery and hormones or are unsure, they'll pressure you into both and refuse to give you psychotherapy. (According to a different ex-FTM.) Trans call talk therapy or treatment of underlying mental health issues instead of a fast track to surgery ""conversion therapy."" Remember all those anti-conversion therapy bills passed in several states a couple years ago? Ostensibly to protect gay people? They changed the laws for trans treatment. Psychologists are now legally prevented--or at least believe they are (unsure if these laws are constitutional)--from any other treatment. It used to be called ""wait and watch"" protocol. They came in, got diagnosed, got talk therapy-- if they didn't get better or had no underlying issues, then they might be given hormones.  Expert in the field Dr. Kenneth Zucker was fired literally for not handing out hormones out to every potential patient on demand. I'm not sure the situation in the UK. The [Webberyls](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-45767360) (UK Mermaids' in-house doctors) both lost their licenses for handing out hormones like candy to children at unlicensed clinics. It wasn't the overprescribing that got them, it was doing it at non-licensed clinics. UK is having a scandal about their Gender Clinic Tavistock right now. Things are in flux.

ey24ecg,"Video hosting on a scale like YouTube needs a constant stream of money to run. Even smaller sites already need advertisers to keep that money flowing (you could charge the users, but that would scare many of them away). And what are the two arch enemies of advertising? Opinions and controversy. Pretty much all big companies are slaves to banks and investors, which means it is important for them to appear profitable in the near future, because investors want some interest for their money. So it is really important for those companies to stay out of controversies that could reduce their profits.

Google gets most of their money from tailored ads, which means they match the right ad with the right content and also the right audience. Unfortunately we live in a time where people really like to get offended and share their offendedness everywhere. And as an advertiser you really don't want to be associated with anything that has the chance of sparking up a shitstorm on the internet.

But of course YouTube isn't doing the greatest possible job, their algorithms - which really aren't as great as Google thinks - are filtering videos for certain shapes and words that could spark controversy, which has lead to certain words practically being banned. Certain topics and channels have a really hard time, sometimes their whole raison d'être gets under the demonitisation hammer, because subjects like swords and guns just aren't as advertiser friendly as puppies (controversial with animal rights activists) and rainbows (better block comments, as promptly sporting a symbol of the gay community could spark a shitstorm about not including <insert other sexual orientation, gender identity or combination thereof>).

Not only that, but certain content could backlash on YouTube and other advertisers. For example, if YouTube lets too many videos of nutjobs explaining how the holocaust wasn't true, but should've been stay up on their site, some advertisers might get backlash simply for associating with a site that lets videos like these exists.

So even if you'd crowdfund a competitor, at a certain size you'd have the dumpster fire like YT.

If you genuinely care about this community, you would be wanting to seek the best possible outcome. If it happens to be surgery, along the lines with what we’re doing now, then we should do that. But if it happens to be something else, then we should be doing that. And if talking about it, exploring ideas, and searching for the best possible outcomes upsets some people, then we need to decide what’s more important; upsetting some people in search for truth and best practise, or just picking something and running with it.

1. Most families support LGBT people now.
2. LGBT people with unsupportive families who leave their unsupportive families have higher suicide rates than LGBT people with supportive families
3. Really LGBT people just need to see a psychologist and get better
4. We need to stop censoring everything on the Internet to please LGBT people

Regarding 0, I don't know whether or not that's the case, but I'd love it if it were. Most of my friends and family were supportive when I came out, and it was a blessing; I don't know if I could have made it without that.

Which brings us to 1. Yes, generally speaking, LGBT people with hostile or unsupportive families have higher suicide rates than LGBT people with supportive families, regardless of how the former handles their familial relationships. This is well documented, and strong evidence backing the fact that LGBT people are not inherently mentally ill; the suicidality comes from mistreatment rather than being LGBT.

Moving onto 2, yes, we often do see psychologists to get better. Psychologists treat us for depression and anxiety, among other mental illnesses. They may even help us manage gender dysphoria if we're trans. They do not, however, ""treat"" gayness or transness, as these aren't mental illnesses. The American Psychological Association has [guidelines](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) for treating transgender and gender-nonconforming people, and convincing them that they are actually their assigned gender is not among the recommended practices. The APA supports transgender people in our identities.

For those rare cases, I would feel comfortable calling those individuals by whichever pronoun they prefer. However, we aren't talking about the outliers.

>Scientific fact and reality *do* indeed conclude trans women are real women.

Science isn't determined by a random blog article. Words have definitions. Female :of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes.

Let's try to define something else. Perhaps a shoe.

Shoes :a covering for the foot, typically made of leather, having a sturdy sole and not reaching above the ankle.

You could argue that not all shoes are on feet. I'm sure some people put shoes on their hands.

Now we have Shoes :a covering typically made of leather, having a sturdy sole and not reaching above the ankle.

But, not all shoes cover something, and they are not always made of leather. 

Now we have Shoes : having a sturdy sole and not reaching above the ankle.

But some shoes are old and worn. They don't have a sturdy sole. 

Shoes : not reaching above the ankle.

But, if I put my shoes on a table, surely they reach above the ankle.

ey269uv,"Dont know if this fits, but people who dont understand pediphiles. The word ""pediphile"" references someone who is attracted to kids, and does not mean they have ever had contact with kids or that they even want to, it just describes what their attracted to.

People dont choose their race, their gender, or their sexual orientations. Their are lots of fetishes, ranging from breast to vore to pedophilia. You dont choose it, your born with it.

People born with pedophilia are fucked from the moment they realise they have it. For some people, they will have ""warm"" feelings toward kids before puberty, but won't understand what it is, and that's often the first sign. 

Day to day life is crippling for these people, as they are constantly torment by their own body, and are constantly in a state of stress. Many will feel sick to their stomachs when they see kids, and will avoid children for that reason. Some are only attracted to kids, so they will never have sex, never get married, never have kids (obviously), and many live very sad and disappointing lives.

Society has a view of them as these evil people who love to hurt kids, but that's not the case for most of them. It's normal to make a comment saying pediphiles should be killed or deserve death just for existing, and saying otherwise is considered an violently unpopular opinion or is just plain banned.

Life for pediphiles is made worst by their being no solutions or help for they. Their is no ""coming out"" moment where you tell people your a pediphile, as you will be outcasted by family and friends, so they must keep it to themselves forever. Therapy is often recommended, but cant actually change your orientation, so they will continue to suffer.

Many pedophiles commit suicide without anyone ever knowing they were pediphiles. Anyone regardless of wealth can be born a pediphile. While their is help for transgenders and gay people, their is no support, no help for pediphiles.

Many people say the only help a pediphile will get is a bullet to the head, and often times that is delivered by the pediphile themselves. With no help, no support, not even any solutions, and with society hating and wanting us dead, the only real thing we can do I just die.

But that doesnt solve the issue. People will continue to be born. And not just good, caring people are born pedophiles, but also bad ones. They bad people are the ones on the news for molesting children. But if their was any kind of support for them, would more children be saved?

Wouldn't it benefit everyone to recognize this as a disability and offer treatments rather then ignore and hate them for existing? Is their any help?

No matter how many times this is discussed, the answer is always the same.

Decades ago, some baby boys were given a surgery that gave them vaginas. They were raised as girls, and given hormones as they got older.

These boys were not comfortable with their assigned gender, because underneath it all, they were still men. Like transgender people, they experienced gender dysphoria, and transitioning was the only way they could alleviate it.

I don’t think there is a best way.  I think there might be a best way for you.  And there are many factors that go into that best way, because what is best is up to your needs.

From my understanding of the research and the science, transitioning is the best treatment for dysphoria.  But with transitioning comes consequences.  As does not transitioning.   

And it’s not just a “transition is good”versus “transition is bad” deal.  There is “full-time as my preferred gender,” “full time as my mom-preferred gender” and any gradient in between such as “I work as my mom-preferred gender but on my off hours, I present as my preferred gender.”  (It was supposed to be non-preferred, but mom-preferred fits too.)

If only we can live at a time when a daughter can come home one day with her girlfriend and her parents welcome them without batting an eye, then we don't need labels anymore. When two guys can hold hands in public without anyone judging, that would be the label-less Utopia we'd all want to be in. But this is today, and society wants to call us something because being Cisgenered Heterosexual is the ""Default"" and the rest of us are ""Others""

**On Gender**: There's already a lot of scientifically-backed studies differentiating people's biological sex and the gender they occupy as they grow into adulthood. Legally, yes, someone born with a penis will be written down as ""Male"", but that may not be in sync with what their brain tells them they are - which manifests itself as Dysphoria and the effects can be crippling. That's why the law is being amended in many countries to be in-line with modern science. And just like before, we'd also love to not go with labels, for trans people to just be normal, but here we are - ""because you have a vagina at birth, we're labeling you as Female and you're not allowed in male spaces, no matter how you physically change"".

**On Bathrooms**: This is punishing an entire group of people for somebody else's crime.

It's basically ""We are scared cis-straight men abusing the system so let's force all trans people into situations they're not supposed to be in."" And to be perfectly honest, when have perverts ever needed a legal excuse to be perverts? Me and my family have been catcalled in places where it's illegal to catcall, but they're still there. Giving rights to trans folks is not going to change anything.

Plus, the scenario you're imagining has not been a problem for countries with bathroom bills in place.

**On Locker Rooms**: What do you do then if someone born female gets Phalloplasty and now has a dick? Would he still be banned from the men's room? If a transwoman decided to get a vagina and grow breasts, would she be forced to go naked in front of straight men? And thus labels and bathroom bills and a fight to allow trans people to use the bathrooms where they feel like they'd be harassed in less. I know it's an extreme example but look at Buck Angel - born a woman and kept his vagina. Would you honestly tell me you'd want to force him to use the female locker room just because of what he was born as?

In a perfect world bathrooms, locker rooms, saunas, there would be gender neutral options for anyone okay with sharing those spaces with everyone else, no labels, doesn't matter if you're ""male"" or ""female"" or ""cis"" or ""trans"" or ""straight"" or whatever. No labels at all. And -optionally- private cubicles for anyone not wanting to see or show anyone at all because those people exist too.

>It’s not a term that’s supposed to be used on people IRL

The word “trap” is used in real life about real people. It shouldn’t be, but it is.

There have been many cases of [trans women being murdered](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unlawfully_killed_transgender_people) by men after they found out they used to be male. These men will usually justify themselves by saying that they were “tricked” into having gay sex. 

When you use the word “trap”, you’re enforcing the mindset that trans women or feminine men are trying to deceive men, which is a mindset that gets them killed.

>Tr*p isn’t dehumanizing

ey29w23,"I think your interpretation of the use of the term ""sex work"" is exactly that, your own intrepretation.

These girls provide a sexual service for others which generates income so by that very definition they are SEX WORKERS. The argument of the DMCA and copyright is arbitrary and a lot of the girls who make content try to get their stuff taken down. Illegal pirating and fraudulent copyright infringement runs rampant all over the internet. On cam sites there is a DMCA warning that cammers have full ownership over their videos and any posting should be reported for breach of privacy.

No one is selling their stuff ON reddit, twitter, tumblr, etc. they are selling it through legitimate third party hosting websites designed for 18+ only. They sell their services through porn sites as professionals. Yes, professionals. Definition: ""engaged in a specified activity as one's main paid occupation rather than as a pastime.""

There are amatuer sports players who DONT GET PAID which, again, by definition, is why they are amatuers. College athletes are arguably to some people (not myself) some of the most talented athletes in sports for their age. Are they professionals? NO BECAUSE THEY DONT GET PAID.

ey2bafl,"Thr fact that people who support TIM access to female spaces use racism to justify that access is racist in itself because many victims of trans ideology are WOC! 

The reason that females have separate facilities from males is not just cultural; it's also to provide safe places from male sexual assault. And TIM assault women at the same rate as other males. 

They keep pushing the line that they aren't like other males because they're thinking & actions are female. And they keep promoting pseudo science to back them up. But reputable science & statistics prove that this is a lie. 

For the safety of females, society allows for them to have separate facilities from males without it being considered discrimination. Since TIM also assault women & girls in these facilities it's NOT discrimination to deny them access as well. TIM have no more right to access female spaces than any other males.

We must once again fight for laws to provide safe spaces for females from males. How they identify doesn't change the fact that allowing them into female spaces endangers women & girls and must be stopped.

The SAFETY of women & must come first. Gender Identity cannot be allowed to expose women & girls to assault.

Also women & girls have the human right to dignity & to be free from sexual abuse. Both of these rights are being  violated by trans policies.  Females are forced to expose their bodies to males & are exposed to male genitals in showers & changing rooms, etc. Many men take advantage of self-id to policies for this purpose.

Trans & lgb orgs have stated that they're determined to destroy female rights based on the oppression of their sex and replace them with laws that protect men pretending to be women. 

If this doesn't sound like a threat; just think about laws that are meant to address lack of the lack of females in various jobs, professions & education. You take away female & replace it with gender and now you have men impersonating women taking those places. Women will now have no legal protection to stop this from happening.

Every and any operation/medication/treatment carries risk. That's why people are required to be of sound mind and body and of legal age to make those decisions for themselves, and why legal guardians are needed to make informed decisions for their children.

These i just find problematic. First of all you are assuming an US Vs Them mentality (Tribalism)  against the transgendered in our community, which is sadly nothing new. You are dictating that the Gays (lesbian or gay men) were the only one fighting for their rights. Like it was just them and them alone. 

It's like the argument of straight passing homosexuals make towards the flaming homosexuals ""why do you guys have to be LOUD. I'm just living my life"". Guess what brenda the counter to this argument applies to you. The gays (LGBTQA+) and our Allies, all of them fought side by side for the rights we wish to have (here in the philippines) and what has already been established for others (USA, some states); and another thing linda, the transexuals are usually one of the first to take to the streets in protest, since they like our more ""LOUD"" variations are the first to come under attack from violence and others, especially those openly living their lives. To say we have more pressing issues at hand is down right privilledged of you to say. I believe People are capable enough in general to think about multiple things and take them on. 

>. We didn't guilt people into changing the definition of basic biology for us.
If this is about that trans person posting about not gendering babies in their Birth certificates i would agree. The only ones that would be applicable for that are children with ambigous genitalia or the Intersex. Since the question there is biological sex. Otherwise see the arguments above.

Communication is key and an adult conversation prior to a reveal of something intimate should always take place. The world is sadly far from the ideal, hence the requirement of this. On the other hand, i highly disagree with other people enforcing/impossing their preferrence on other people, which is not the case here. Since the picture merely states that trans and cis gays CAN be attracted to each other and should not be shoe horned. No one is saying you HAVE TO be attracted to the trans, like it's a requirement. (I'll end this here because thats a whole different argument to have).",transexual,phlgbt,Homophobia within our ranks.,https://reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/cv4lxm/homophobia_within_our_ranks/ey2czpo/

ey2es78,"Okay, I have to give some background information first as you seem misinformed about the whole transgender children controversy.

Blockers happens as young as 8. Have you noticed that OP is saying that his step mom is trying to put her 6 years old son on hormone blockers? They are not reversible, thats a total myth. Not only do they forever lose the years that they have been on blockers in term of development but blockers also permanently lower they I.Q. and weaken they bones and cause how many others issues that we havent discovered yet. Those are serious drugs that are being used off-labels. Plus 100% of trans-identified children who take puberty blockers go on to HRT, so the ""fully reversible"" argument is sadly just a red herring.

HRT happens as young as 13. Which are irreversible and makes the individual sterile.

Surgery, which are obviously irreversible, can also happens as soon as 13, in the case of mastectomy for females. For males its a little bit later at 16/17 for SRS. From what I gather transgender activists are trying to lower those numbers.

To come back to what the OP was talking about, social transition. This is reversible and harmless right? Well not really. When a 6 years old boy is told that he is really a girl trapped in the wrong body this has an impact. He will become more uncomfortable in his body, will have a bad understanding of reality, much more difficulties in relating to his peers, a lot of anxiety (much more than usual) at the idea of becoming a man. Gaslighting and grooming a child this way is devastating.

ey2jzuk,"This video was much better than I expected, though imperfect.

Like probably most people in the gender debate, I am familiar with ContraPoints/Natalie and have watched most of her videos, but I am always unsure what to make of her. In some ways she comes across as a relatively male-friendly feminist, perhaps partly due to experiences from when she used to live as a male, and also being influenced by the ex-MRA Theryn Meyer.

But because her videos present so much self-parody and many different personalities arguing with each other, it’s often unclear exactly which statements are ironic and which are her real opinions (or if she’s even sure herself). Her style basically allows her to say controversial things without fully committing to them and therefore without overtly offending anyone (not unlike the Pick-Up Artists who she dislikes). This video is a particularly bad offender in that regard, as the entire first five minutes is all style and no substance, in an apparent attempt to virtue-signal to both sides – but it does improve after that.

Natalie surprised me by acknowledging some pretty fundamental challenges to feminist dogma. She not only quoted some statistics on male disposability, but even admitted her life has improved in various ways since she became a woman, including being viewed as deserving of help, no longer being sexually invisible, and no longer being viewed as potentially dangerous. I think she is moving the Overton window in the right direction by bringing all these male perspectives to a feminist audience who might not have considered them before.

She still downplays male issues a bit, though not as much as I expected:

* She accuses male advocates of “whataboutism”, which in my opinion is just a word designed to discredit anyone who challenges propaganda against a particular group (I notice the same word is often used by neocons to defend war propaganda).
* She criticizes male advocates for portraying men as victims, but that misses the point. Throughout history, even pre-feminism, victim power has usually been more in the hands of women than men, which contradicts her assumption that men are traditionally unilaterally privileged.
* She mentions her experiences of male issues are only anecdotal. That’s true, but it’s important to remember that feminist theory is likewise based on similar anecdotes about women’s lived experiences.
* I find it difficult to believe her claim that her ideas are taken less seriously now she’s a woman. Since she became a woman, she's gained mainstream media praise for her channel and a legion of fans who seem disturbingly cultish, worshiping her as their “queen” and “mommy”, like a left-wing equivalent of the cult of personality surrounding Jordan Peterson. Indeed, this very video is an example of a trans-woman being taken seriously saying things that were taken less seriously when cis-men said them. I admit, being taken less seriously is one of those issues reported by so many women that I think there must be something in it, but whatever it is must be more nuanced than how it is presented by Natalie and other feminists.
* She says false rape accusations are over-discussed because they do not affect every man – but does she not see the connection between false rape accusations and the general prejudice that men are dangerous? It is very related to a systemic issue: society (and feminism) provides women with a ready-made narrative by which to demonize men they dislike.
* She seems to contradict herself a few times on whether men are “privileged”. She admits it’s difficult to compare whether men or women have it worse, and suggests only the men on top are privileged. But at another point she describes men’s angst as related to being “the privileged class”. (And even though the men on top are privileged by their positions of authority, it may also be that historically the women married to these men benefited from sharing in their wealth without the risks of holding overt authority.)

I was expecting the video to finish with the usual platitudes that men should just support feminism and/or Marxism and that will solve all our problems. But Natalie again exceeded my expectations by breaking that narrative, despite having implicitly endorsed it in the past. She rightly points out that even if a revolutionary end to capitalism is possible, it wouldn’t address male gender issues. And she rightly points out that feminism basically just tells men to stop being “toxic”, and the idea of a movement actually by and for men is taboo on the left.

So, what do I think of Natalie’s solution that men need to create for ourselves a new positive ideal of manhood? I don’t know. On the one hand, I don’t like that people are coralled into arbitrary roles based on an accidents of birth. On the other hand, there may be reasons why men need to maintain a separate male identity, eg. men may be considered unattractive if we can’t figure out how to present ourselves in a way that taps into women’s evolved sexual instincts. So I guess maybe every man has to find some balance between those things, but I don’t know how to do that for myself let alone advise other men on it.

Moreover, a positive ideal of manhood can never be a full solution to male issues. Although it’s good that Natalie recognizes women shouldn’t lecture men on how to be men, she’s wrong to place all of the burden on men to solve men’s issues. How can that address all the prejudices and discrimination against men that Natalie acknowledged earlier in the video? To solve those issues, something has to change about 1) laws and policies on certain issues and 2) society’s attitudes and particularly women’s attitudes toward men.",trans-woman,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Video Discusses the Need for Men's Group to Discuss Positive Masculinity,https://reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/cuoj1u/video_discusses_the_need_for_mens_group_to/ey2jzuk/

I am a radfem/gc sympathiser if nothing else. Being any kind of feminist in my world is socially isolating). 

Something that happens in these circles is that the main religion is so so conservative that in reaction small local groups can vary a lot and be kind of liberal or even leftist/socialist and some are even woman-centered. BUT they take on all the gender stuff uncritically, with the thinking that they're siding with the underdog. One of the organizers of our ostensibly woman-centered group has a non-binary child and has taken on all the trans stuff and has invited LBTQ people to it.  Granted it would probably be a group of 0, lol, but I'm like, watch the TQ, because once it becomes something more interesting than making sandwiches, men will want in and they'll take over and men are already well looked after in our religion.

ey2n3a1,"Well sure, but “things” get done all the time regardless of who the President is. You claimed earlier that the main reason you want a particular person in the White House - over, I assume, any generic Republican - is to “set the direction and pick the right people” (on mobile, so sorry for the paraphrase). 


The direction he set is pretty run-of-the-mill conservative on everything besides trade deficits and immigration, right? Like you could imagine Mike Pence or Ted Cruz banning transgender persons from the military or caving to the NRA or lowering taxes? Honestly, even Jeb Bush or John Kasich would probably support most of that.

Now, for the things he’s supposedly uniquely focused on:
- As President Trump likes to claim, the border immigrant crisis is worse than ever.
- [Our trade deficit is at a record high](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/us-trade-deficit.amp.html) 

Which leaves his ability to “hire the right people.” As expressed in the previous comment, if this is all he’s uniquely good for over the average conservative Republican, why are you so content in watching him fail over and over at hiring the right people for the last 2.5 years?

The fact that he assumed others would act in good faith is not a good excuse, it’s exactly my point. Any time in the federal government would have shown him how wrong those assumptions were. You don’t think he would have figured that out with two years in the Senate?

ey2ngm5,"> it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development

> even the game devs here acknowledged the fact the character was transgender was forced into the dialogue

This is your problem right here. By “forced” you make it sound like the character shouldn’t be transgender at all, but that’s clearly not what the devs are saying. They’re saying they should’ve developed the exposition about her. They obviously had every intention to have this character be transgender, it’s not some last minute decision that was “forced” into the dialogue. In other words, they’re not talking about the fact that she’s transgender, just the way that they introduce it to the audience. That doesn’t sound very “forced” to me. 

> the game developers acknowledged it was shitty writing

Where did they say that? All they said they could’ve improved the character development. That doesn’t mean they automatically think the writing is “shitty”. This is what I hate about people using these kinds of quotes. It’s happened with Star Wars where someone will try to pull something from an actor or director and blow it out of proportion, and misconstrue their intent. Every developer, every director, every creator is going to have things they would’ve liked to improve in their art, when they discuss honestly a change they could’ve made, that doesn’t mean they think what they made was “bad”. You’re putting words into their mouths and exaggerating what they were trying to say. 

> perfectly valid opinion

> there is no need for this in computer games

I’ll let you figure this one out. 

> I doubt I will be getting any apologies from anyone who replied to me below

Good. They don’t owe you one. Your quote doesn’t change anything. The devs aren’t talking about forcing a transgender character into the game, they’re talking about character development. Hypothetically, even if the devs did say they added it on a whim, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s “bad for computer games”. There are many people out there who want media with representation and acknowledgement. Having games with diversity and inclusion, regardless of how “forced” they are, helps to change the stigma around these kinds of characters. This in turn allows for more games to make these decisions and perhaps do it in a way that flows better with the story, not that I think it’s particularly interrupted in your example anyways. The purpose of the devs decision doesn’t necessarily matter if the end result is a game with more inclusion and representation.",transgender,Gamingcirclejerk,"I heard it has women, don't buy it man.",https://reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/cv1cm0/i_heard_it_has_women_dont_buy_it_man/ey2ngm5/

ey2pmgm,"Please consider that it's terrifying to discover that your gender doesn't align with what you and everyone else have thought it should be. It feels disorienting before you know what it is, and hopeless often thereafter. When you finally find the name for the thing you've been feeling is wrong, and it's ""transgender"", and you look around at how people equate trans people with sexual predators, and you think about your own views on trans people, and you realize that you have a huge discomfort affecting you that most people will never feel and may not even know or acknowledge that it's possible to feel, that's the sort of thing you kind of need to talk about and find support for, or it can drive you to despair.

I also hate the feeling of not knowing something or being set up to be wrong about something and ridiculed for it, but did you consider speaking *to* the person who presented such a gender barrier to you? Second-person is gender-neutral! Or, use ""they"" -- that person might be frustrated that they try their best to make ""they"" the obvious choice for referring to them, but get only ""he"" and ""she"" in return. If you mess up and pick the wrong one first, analyze your reaction to being corrected. Why should you expect yourself to be an expert in other people and feel so much shame in being wrong? Just say ""ah, okay,"" and use the right pronoun instead next time.

Trans people do a lot to guide others to the pronouns they prefer to hear applied to them. Some have their facial bones shaved down. Some train their voices extensively, or avoid speaking. Some work out to gain muscle in strategic places. Some refuse to wear or do things they in fact love for fear that the clothing or pastime choice might confuse and anger others or invalidate, in the eyes of people out to ""catch them in a lie,"" all the other work they have done to make people like you comfortable. 

Often, it feels like no amount of surgery or self-denial will suffice, and they'll just have to bite their tongues forever while people call them the wrong gender. That's a big cross to bear -- imagine you woke up one morning and people just called you by a pronoun that makes you feel uncomfortable, and turned and called you demanding and pushy for correcting them, and kept using the wrong one anyway. It's frustrating, and trans people sometimes cave to frustration, just like everyone else.

Don't expect trans people to be Jedi masters of frustration-calming, or to feel no emotions at all when misgendered. They are often graceful about this. Sometimes it's too much for them. Like anyone else, except they get constant practice and know that the frustration of interacting with others is just something they have to deal with. 

The frustration of interacting with others is something you have to deal with, too. A trans person's ""why can't everyone just let me live and call me the right thing - don't they know how hard this is for me?"" is the same frustration as your ""why can't they all just shut up and leave me alone about their pronouns - don't they know how hard this is for me?"" It builds up inside naturally, and when it spills out, it makes whoever spills it look bad. But that buildup is counteracted by understanding. 

I bet you feel relieved by trans people saying ""I get it, I mess it up with other people too. I won't flip out over a mistake."" Challenge yourself to offer them that same understanding - ""My bad, you must be sick of that.

ey2qwty,">What they are pointing out is the idea, as you clearly demonstrate in the remainder of your argument is that sex =! gender, and we will simply have to agree to disagree on this one.


Well, you can't disagree on this though.
Gender and sex are different.

Sex is your genitals/chromosomes and your gender is your brain.

Also, again, no, trans people don't ""think"" they are the opposite gender.
There's neurological evidence that shows that they have the brain of the gender they identify as. 

>I believe you’re referring to this study about brain scans:

Nope I am not referring to that study.

I will put the studies I am referring to at the end of my comment. 

>I’ll refer you to this article in which the author, who is obviously a trans advocate clearly argues against the use of brain scans and insists we should take trans people’s subjective experience at face value instead of relying on scientific evidence:

>http://www.them.us/story/brain-scans-transgender-identity


You want me to take an article that was written by a person who thinks personal experiences are more important than scientific evidence? 

Isn't this exactly the kind of stuff that conservatives are against? I'm pretty you're the ones who like ""facts and logic"" so why are you even sending that link? 

Also, I really don't care if he is an advocate for trans right or whatever, that doesn't make the claim that personal experiences are important that scientific evidence less incorrect. 

While the personal and subjective experiences of each trans individual are important. 
Saying that those experiences can be even more important than actual scientific fact doesn't sound logical to me. 


>Cis brains must form distinct categories, a “male brain” and “female brain,” in order for such a comparison to be meaningful in the first place — and they don’t

So here it says that there and female brains are equal. 

>Though fMRI studies of sex differences have been around for years, the literature on sex differences in brain imaging is likely biased, favoring studies that purport to find sex differences over those that do not.

But here it says that studies found differences between the brains?

Isnt that litteraly against what they just said? If there have been found differences between male and female brains, then make and female brains are at least a little bit different, no? 

>Nothing that I’ve stated here comes from a place of malevolence or spite. And I’m not denying your right to exist nor am I denying your subjective experience

And I agree that there is a very small segment of our population that are so mentally ill that body disfigurement thru hormones and amputations was problems the best recourse to appease the mental illness.  

However,  throwing this mental illness up on social media and pretending like it is normal and okay is INSANE!!!!   

Abusing the vulnerability normal tweens/teens going thru normal feelings of puberty (insecure and self doubting etc) seems to be a main tenant of Trans Ideology.  Making them think their very normal feelings are actually dysphoria and that there is something wrong with them that they want to become a disfigured medical patient for life.

ey2tmzm,"I’m no longer active in a discord server I used to love because I did say I was GC. I’m an idiot because I didn’t realize that my schools discord was 99% LGBTQIA+ and many people there identified as something they’re not. I just felt awkward and unwanted when someone said “yea I didn’t talk to you at the last event even though I sat next to you because you’re GC” 

This isn’t a big deal in the “real world” but I’m 20 and in college so this is the real world to me, even though it’s nothing serious like jobs or dating. I still felt alienated by people I liked. 

Now I’m in a different discord server and there’s a non-binary girl there who was venting once about her parents not respecting her pronouns. I don’t even know what her pronouns are, nor do I care. No one there attacks me in that server, yet most there know I’m GC, so they’re obviously just a better group of people anyway. I’m still upset I was ostracized by my college Discord, but on some level I feel that it was my fault for coming into their safe space and inserting a different opinion (even if it’s a fact).

ey2tulv,"Dressing more androgynous as a transitional period would make the process easier since it is less noticable, less of a sudden shift, and it is gradual-- which people tend to be more comfortable with-- but honestly, if you can confidently put on a wig and feminine clothing and just got for it, more power to you!

&#x200B;

Just, bear in mind that the world ain't the safest for people like us, especially teen trans because you're more vulnerable than legal adults (taken less seriously, more restricted in options for working and how to spend your time, etc.) I would highly recommend trying more androgynous or androgynous with a feminine slant first. It's what I do currently, and I've been figuring out how to wear more feminine clothing as I go. Keeping it real, if the average person sees a completely masculine figure wearing a dress or a cute skirt, they might see transgender and have sympathy, or they might think you're just joking, or they might get angry and verbally or God forbid physically try to get you to act different. These are things to think about, and it sucks, but it's practical.

From the link:

> The law amends the Criminal Code by adding ""gender identity or expression"" to the definition of ""identifiable group"" in section 318 of the Code.[9][10] Section 318 makes it a criminal offence to advocate or promote genocide against members of an identifiable group, which now includes gender identity or gender expression. Since the definition of ""identifiable group"" is also used in section 319 of the Code, the amendment also makes it a criminal offence to incite or promote hatred because of gender identity or gender expression.[11]

> The law also adds ""gender identity or expression"" to section 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[12] This section is part of the sentencing provisions and makes gender identity and gender expression an aggravating factor in sentencing, leading to increased sentences for individuals who commit crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity or expression.

More to the point:

> Jordan Peterson, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, criticized the bill, saying that it would compel speech. Peterson argued that the law would classify the failure to use preferred pronouns of transgender people as hate speech. According to legal experts, not using preferred pronouns would not meet legal standards for hate speech.[16][17]

Answer right now no one in my family knows about this situation or has ever heard of it.

 Ironically it  happened when I was 14. At that time I was hanging out with a friend that I assumed for the longest time was a girl. Everything that they did struck to me as if they were a 100% a girl.  It wasn't until they told me their true feelings and how they had a crush on me ever since we were in 3rd grade.  So I went to go hug them and felt something brush below me,it was a dick. Now that time I didn't know that they weren't  a girl but I didn't freak out I was OK with them. A few hours later we're getting down and doing the dirty, At some point we even 69ed.

 But after that encounter I want more of that type of variant but for some reason in a cartoon form.
So I  hopped on  Bing, Turned  the safe  search  filter  off and searched and I shit you not ""Boys that look like girls hentai"" And once I saw the search results I was locked in. And for those 5 weeks or so, I legitimately beat my meat 4 times every day to it. It wasn't until I clicked on a certain picture I liked and found now the proper term for one I was looking at was called a ""Trap"". This created a large obsession, But it was a controlled one.



Extra: When I was surfing the rest of the Internet I had found out that the word ""Trap"", Came off as a slur towards transgender women. At that very point I felt immediately ashamed. I thought pad because I thought always time I had been beating my meat that I was technically offending someone. That created the years called the dry years, They lasted for about 2 years.",transgender,thaps,So what got you guys into traps?,https://reddit.com/r/thaps/comments/bnm5pl/so_what_got_you_guys_into_traps/ey3lajz/

So I am 27 and invested in bitcoin about 6 years ago, and have been told I would not have to work until Im 32 if I spend only 92 thousand a year.

&#x200B;

So money is not a problem and I am getting married to my boyfriend soon anyways.

But the reason I took my 8 year old half brother was because his stepdad and my mom were trying to mutilate him, and they physically hurt him VERY severely <but I cant say what they did or this post will get removed, just keep in mind he still cries about it to me>.

  
So he told me he was scared one day, he said that my mom wanted him circumsised, and he did not have a choice, he said he begged and pleaded but they were only ""more mean to him"".

  
I told him if they ever did something like that to him again to record it on his tablet and show me the video, the video made me cry when I saw it and I payed for a very pricey lawyer, and a week later I called cps and reported them for child abuse.

  
I took my own mother to court, and we argued that her schizophrenia has evolved to such a extreme that she has showed herself unable to raise children, and me and my lawyer showed the judge the video and had the my brother tell him everything that happened.

&#x200B;

The judge decided I will get full custody but my stepdad and mom get visitation rights.

&#x200B;

The problem comes later when they are now shaming me, my stepdad said I shouldn't raise  his own son around my ""faggot of a boyfriend"" and that every kid deserves a mom, and not a confused boy who thinks hes a woman.

  
And my mom is leaving me messages saying I am so in the wrong and a son should never take away a child from his mother.

&#x200B;

are they right or AITA?

And there is a vid there with  things that can be tried out, there are hints concerning looking for a gender therapist, and there are also hints concerning looking for support in the second link.

And some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.

And it can come in cycles and it can get stronger over time. Going into the direction it points to, even when it is weaker at times, may be a good idea.

And persistently and in depth questioning gender assigned at birth can be a sign in itself. Cis people usually do not do this. For them its a few short thoughts of how it might be, and they move on.

ey3rds2,"The moment that I finally realized that I was transgender, I let my wife know that we needed to discuss something. That night I explained to her what I'd come to figure out about myself and what I planned to do with that information. I'd shares with her some of the confusing gender related things that I'd dealt with in the past, but she was obviously still very caught off guard and shocked.

We talked all night about the future of our relationship and transition plans. We talked about our fears. We talked about our dreams and how this changed so much for the both of us. She wanted to stick things out no matter what. She loved me and supported me. It was very difficult for her to imagine being with a woman, though. She'd always considered herself to be straight but she was adamant that she wasn't going anywhere. I still remember one very impactful thing that she told me... She told me she'd been thinking about all of the reasons that she loved me and that she realized not one of them had to do with my gender.

I did not take things slow. I started HRT two weeks later. The first few months were definitely an adjustment for the two of us. She was already seeing a therapist and it helped to have someone to work her feelings out with besides me. I'd say one of the biggest challenges for her to overcome personally was how she viewed her own identity within our relationship and presenting that to the rest of the world. It was tough for her to do that on top of grapple with the loss of what she imagined our future to have been.

The single most important thing for us was communication. Complete honesty and trust were always pillars of our relationship. I can't imagine doing this without knowing that we could bare ourselves completely to one another.

So here we are, 16 months later and still together, stronger than ever before. Our relationship has changed quite a bit. I know that I'm a better partner now. She's a much more confident woman than when we started and she's quite happy to have discovered more about her own sexuality. It's been an amazing transition for her as well.

Talk to her face to face is my suggestion. And expect shock. Expect pain and tears. One more suggestion: don't compromise. Don't lead her on with promises that you can't keep. The one thing I wish I could go back and change is how I told my wife that I was just thinking about starting HRT. I knew in my heart that I was already going to. I told her that I would never get bottom surgery. My feelings on that have changed over time. I had to go back on a lot of what I said initially on fear that I would lose her. It wasn't fair to either of us.

I am currently 16 in high school and am bisexual however have only told a handful of friends this before as I don't want many more people than that knowing.

I have a mate (friend A) who I have known since we were much younger and been good friends since, but recently we have gotten into a few arguments. Granted, most of them we have both been in the wrong, however during them he has threatened to tell a bunch of people ""my big secret"". I usually think he is bluffing until one point where he just tells someone (friend B) for no reason. We were not even arguing at that point.
Being perfectly honest I don't even mind that this other person knew because he was a friend but I just didn't want to tell him now or in that way.

Now I had not talked to Friend B about it yet but he and friend A were talking about at one point and another person, who hates me by the way, over heard them talking about It and asked if it was true. But instead of joking or saying it wasn't true to him, friend A just said it was true. Now this guy who hates me knows a fairly big secret about me which I defiantly don't want him knowing. And Friend  A knows this well.

I confront friend A about it and he gives a half assed apology and I tried to just forgive and move on. But then we were having an unrelated argument, with a  couple other people around. Then out of the blue he just shouts, ""At least I'm not a bisexual faggot."" The people around look pretty shocked slowly leave as I am fuming on the inside.
The worst part about this is that he later says that it is my fault and not his problem ad he refuses to face up to what he did.

After this me and a couple of other friends, go up to him and just beat him up. Being real ot wasnt that badas we helped him up after and I believed us to be even. But then he got other people to try and hit me, although never did it himself. And a few other friends were saying I was a huge asshole for what I did. 
So I just want to know if what I did was justified and AITA

A Bristol University postgraduate student who made a complaint of bullying against a transgender student has faced a barrage of abuse and even “masked protesters” when she attended disciplinary hearings.

Raquel Rosario-Sanchez, 29, a PhD student from the Dominican Republic, complained to the university about being bullied by a trans student 18 months ago.

The harassment started two months after she arrived to begin her PhD at the university’s Centre for Gender and Violence Research, when she agreed to chair a meeting for the Woman’s Place UK group, she said.

It escalated after formal disciplinary proceedings were launched by the university against the transgender student following Rosario-Sanchez’s complaint. Activists organised a series of protests, urging followers to give the PhD student “hell”.

Rosario-Sanchez said she had been threatened with violence and told she would have eggs and milkshakes thrown at her. She has also been called “heinous scum”.


“I no longer feel safe on campus. Most people who are subject to abuse by trans activists stay silent because if you file a complaint you undergo the campaign of threats I have experienced,” she said.

The university took more than a year to investigate. No disciplinary action was taken.

Last week The Sunday Times reported that around a dozen academics at universities including Oxford and Reading fear a silencing of their freedom of speech by students complaining they are transphobic.

Rosario-Sanchez’s PhD supervisor, Dr Emma Williamson, the head of the university’s Centre for Gender and Violence Research, said: “As members of staff, we cannot advise students to have confidence in the university’s complaints procedures if they do not deal with complaints in a timely, safe, transparent and fair way. I do not know what I can say to a student in future who is making a complaint about being bullied and who is fearful of their safety.”

Rosario-Sanchez says she has fallen behind in her PhD and missed her progress review because she was so stressed, which means she has missed the academic requirements to receive funding from the Dominican Republic.

Without a scholarship she expects to either lose her visa or be forced to take out a large loan to pay for her studies. She said: “It took tremendous effort from all my family to help me get here. I remember being with my mum, so full of hope about coming to the UK to study. Someone stole my future and the university let them.”

The University of Bristol said: “We believe that every effort has been made to support Ms Rosario-Sanchez. Matters relating to individual disciplinary cases are confidential, therefore we are unable to make further comment.”",transgender,GenderCritical,"‘Bullying by transgender student could cost me my visa,’ says postgraduate",https://reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/cvau6g/bullying_by_transgender_student_could_cost_me_my/ey3rx7j/

Genders are a social construct, we attach the idea of gender to different parts of and aspects of our lives. Some people identify as male, some as female, and others identify as non-binary. Without gender. The ""54 genders"" claim you always hear about is based on the argument that you can associate different parts of your life with different things. Those being: body, identity, and social.

So, theoretically, you could identify a non-binary body, a male identity but a female social perspective. This is less common, but it's possible. People who freak out about this are either uninformed or stupid, it's a very easy to grasp concept and really doesn't affect most anyone's lives.

ey3swr2,"In my opinion, the only issue with the TV Series itself would be the way they transmit the plot of the SCP and the point of view they get it from.

For example, I think it would be interesting to show footage of the bodycam on a MTF operative during a raid, or during a containment breach where they must fend off against a large anomaly.

But the problem with this is that, most TV series are looking for protagonists to fill the gaps, and the SCP universe provides very limited individual characters with enough background story or information to tell the audience. So I believe that the best way to show a TV series such as this one, we'll have to create a different point of view from the one we have as readers of the database, and develop a new story (canon or not) in regards to the SCP, while using the info we have at our disposal in the database to immerse the viewers into the representation of the anomaly.",MTF,SCP,"Be honest, you would watch it",https://reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/cvavdy/be_honest_you_would_watch_it/ey3swr2/

I am a trans guy, 18, i was 15 when i realized that i’m trans. When i started high school a girl (i’ll call her Sarah) had a crush on me and i said that i am transgender, she said she doesn’t care and we started dating and it was pretty good in the start. 

After a year, she became manipulative and started make me feel dysphoric all the time, so bad that i didn’t even wanted to speak because my voice is not deep. I was depressed and self-harmed and she didn’t help me and just yelled at me. I kept our relationship going because i was in love with her. 

After 2 years, she said she wants to break up because “i wasn’t a real man and i’ll never be one”. I was shocked because she knew that im transgender before we start dating... we tried to stay as friends but it was weird so we had a distance between us and even our friends started to pick a side too so our friend group was kinda fucked. 

After a couple of months later i met with a guy (i’ll call him Jack) on League of Legends and we started to play together a lot. He was bi, we were staying up at nights and play until i fall asleep on mic by his voice singing my favorite songs to me. I started to have a crush on him. We decided to meet next wednesday to talk about this stuff. 

But then i had an idea, i had my ex’s password and username so i asked Jack if he wants to hack Sarah’s account to get her skins and rp, he said yes and i gave him all the info he needed to hack (which i could do by myself too, i have no idea why i didn’t do that). When he was done with the account Sarah called me and asked if i did anything on her account. I said no, i have no idea and she believed me. 

Jack took her account and then Sarah dm’d her account from her sister’s account, asking why is she got hacked and who is on the account now. He replied her and they suddenly started talking. I said “wtf, don’t talk to her you know she is my ex” but Jack didn’t care and said that he is just having a bit fun. 

Then, the same day, he invited Sarah on the same discord server i was in. I said Jack why he did that and why he is talking to her on voice because she would understand i’m behind all of this but he didn’t care and even said “change your username and join the voice chat, i’d say that you are one of my friend you can listen us” but i didn’t do that. 

Later, Jack told me that they will go to grab some drinks on that Friday because Sarah said “you are so mysterious i want to meet you” to him. I was speechless, i asked him what will happen to us, he said we could still meet on wednesday but i refused if he is going to hang out with him, he said “okay then we will not meet on wednesday”. 

On friday, he came to my school and took her with his car. I stopped talking to him. After a week later he called me and said he is dating with Sarah now.

While I think Blanchard is wrong when he thinks he has found the cause, and I dislike his accusations that trans people are lying and his derogatory terminology ('Erotic Target Location Error""), I think he has stumbled on to and documented an important correlation between gender-related arousal and gender identity variation. I just think he is wrong to see this as a universal cause and effect because there are too many counterexamples in which arousal does not persist but transgender identity does.

There's more to masculine sound than speaking from your chest or a lower pitch. High pitched nadal talking guys still sound like guys, not because of speech patterns but more to do with things like resonance. Training solely for 'talking low' can also just make you sound raspy and pubescent and even damage your vocal cords.

You can achieve better resonance and tone by working with the muscles towards the back of your tongue. Look up 'big dog/small dog' voice excersizes. Your aim is generally to try and create more space for your voice to move through, and lengthen your vocal cords during speech since testosterone failed to.

I've honestly gotten better voice training advice from mtfs, and applying their knowledge in reverse. Most ftms just don't need to train their voice, so the few 'tutorials' you find are from pre-t guys who never really practiced much further.

ey3vki9,"**Goals of radical christian conservatives**

Create a society in accordance with scripture. I mean, I guess theoretically their aims are noble. They think this is what god wants and that it will somehow save us. 

*Belief demands.* 

To reach that goal they apparently need everyone to act like christians. They certainly want us all to believe it or at least to shut up if we don't, and work actively to make sure the law forces us to behave in the way they want. 

*Moral foundation.* 
“This is what god wants” any moral superiority comes from it being allegedly revealed. 



**Goals of the social justice left** 

Most bascially to eliminate unfair and harmful discrimination in society and promote egalitarianism, end exploitation and establish a “just” society.    

*Belief demands*

So yeah. I agree that SJ people generally would like it if everyone believed in this goal and worked towards it or at least didn't actively work to hinder it.  


*Moral foundation*

I don't actually think the aims of the goal are all that controversial for anyone but the most die hard antisocial individualist or fundamentalist believer.   I mean if you have a good case to make for why society should be discriminatory and oppressive then maybe you'll disagree, however I think that most ethical theories would consider this goal to be for the greater good.  Where people get upset is how we are to go about reaching that goal.






**Censorship and laws as a means to reach goals**

So both groups do try to control the behavior of the general population, but that is because both are focused on changing society as a whole.


I'm not sure why the christians need everyone else to act and believe like they do, but regardless they have been effective at using law to enforce behavior in line with their values and censorship to eliminate discussion of ideas contrary to theirs. 


With SJ it just doesn't work if only those who believe in it actually follow it and everyone else keeps acting like they always have towards each other, so it's something that needs all or most of the community on board. 

Among other things, we need to eliminate extremely long lived systemic practices which unfairly limit the political and social equality of many citizens in our society.  This means changing or even eliminating practices we may consider harmless or important parts of our culture.


Personally I think it would be best to convince people to adopt the ideas and needed changes in behavior, and given time i think this is possible. The issue is that most SJ (myself included) believe that there are far too many people suffering injustice in our society right now, so laws and some forms of censorship are a justifiable expedient. 


However I think there is a huge difference in the reasoning behind the attempts to control behavior through law and censorship, and the consequences of that control.




What the fundamentalists want to eliminate or silence is the teaching of scientific theories like evolution,  blasphemy, dirty words, pornography, sex education, anyone wanting to talk about abortion or homosexuality or euthanasia, those who wish to keep christian practices out of government and basically anyone who wants to believe anything different to what they believe has been divinely dictated.   They want to eliminate them because they go against their interpretation of scripture and may lead to questioning of the faith. 

So what negative impacts to these laws or actions have on believers and non-believers?

I would argue that the real outcome is the dumbing down of the population,the promotion of an anti-science/anti-intellectual culture,  the promotion of hatred towards those with different beliefs,  severe impacts on quality of life for those unable to have an abortion or euthanasia, needless and arbitraty restrictions on cultural expression, and the idea that sin is a sufficient reason to make something prohibited and scorned.  


Off the top of my head the social justice advocates want is laws to protect people for discrimination based on gender identity, race, sex etc. Hate speech laws to protect against incitement to violence based on identity. Advocating political correct speech to attempt to deal with the insidious nature of systemic discrimination. Rights to declare and protect the fundamental human dignity of all members of society. Affirmative action and quotas to attempt to equalise those who have been marginalised for so long.  Stopping those like neonazis, fascist nationalists, white supremacists from having a public platform to voice their beliefs.

So what negative impacts to these laws or actions have on believers and non-believers?

You need to be more careful about the language you use.  You cant verbally hate on someone just because of their race or gender or other identity.  Other groups get rights formally expressed that you probably enjoy already.  You might have to hire more disadvantaged minorities, but they are disadvantaged. There would be more minorities in government, but they have been kept out of power for centuries.  And some groups who have had more than ample time to push their beliefs in the marketplace of ideas despite most people generally agreeing that they are shitty beliefs to begin with will stop being able to try to cause division in our society.



This isn't to say that there aren't total nutjobs in both camps pushing totally insane dogmatic agendas, so yeah of course you're going to come across some proposals to restrict some totally insane or innane act.   Also the differences in opinion for how to proceed with SJ goals makes any schism in the church look puny.   There are soooo many differences of opinion and seriously half of the things i hear other SJ say I think are insane and actually cause more harm to the movement than good. I have way more arguments with people on the left than with conservatives.    

And that really is for me the main difference. 

The need and push for changes of behavior coming from the Christians comes from an interpretation of divine revelation. Sure you can challenge the interpretation but that doesn't often get much traction. 

The need and push for changes of behavior coming out of social justice are based on humanist ideas, and are open to disagreement and revision (even if it does feel like they are being dictated).  There is usually a pretty solid philosophical underpinning for a lot of the demands, they just aren't picked at random. 

When people are being hurt by others it's not unreasonable to ask the state to intervene.  Liberty has little value in a society where everyone is fucking mean to each other, especially if they are unaware of how their behavior effects their fellow citizens.  The christians need their laws and censorship to last until the millenium.  Social justice just needs to impose for as long as it takes for people to treat fellow citizens with equal dignity.",gender identity,changemyview,CMV the Social Justice Left is fundamentally the same thing as the Far-Right Christian Conservatives of the 80s and 90s,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvd8p3/cmv_the_social_justice_left_is_fundamentally_the/ey3vki9/

ey3wa1z,"Thanks for the input. I'll try to provide some more info about the story to see if that changes anything:

* Protagonist 2 used to be a sex worker who was abused for her gender identity. This itself is something I'm not sure I have the right to write as a cis author, but having gone through a similar background, I think I can relate closely enough to her experience to write it correctly. For this reason, consent is extremely important to her in any situation(as it is to me) and she would feel slightly violated that P1 did this without her permission.

* Protagonist 1 (who heals P2) is an egoist who has been planning to use Big Bad Evil Object to make the world a perfect place, where everyone is completely self-actualised and worships him. This much is (half) known to the reader before it happens, but not the other protagonists, who all come to hate him for his betrayal (the original reason they decided to work together was to destroy Big Bad Evil Object once they found it). This would mean that P2 would hate P1 for this betrayal, even if she feels overjoyed that her body turned cis. I'm genuinely unsure if this would be a strong enough reason to create any conflict about her bodily change, though, as I can't answer the question of how a trans person would feel about their body turning cis (which is why I posted this thread!).

* She also has the conflict of knowing that the now villain of the story saved her life. I don't know if this would be enough of a conflict point either, but I think it would be interesting to explore how a hero reacts to a hero-turned-villain that saves their life, especially when that villain is a narcissist who lives on other people's gratitude. I would have some mixed feelings for sure.

I am afraid that the current outpouring of support and attention will make her feel like her new gender identity must be right, and then hormones must be right too, or a mastectomy too, etc.

The name stuff bothers me too. When I talked with her, I mentioned how it's worth considering why a male name and less female pronouns makes her feel more comfortable, free and empowered - maybe it says something about the society we live in and the gender roles in it? Her reaction was along the lines of ""Do you \*really\* think that gender identity is about freedom, choice or empowerment? It's my IDENTITY"". Although she clearly stated her discomfort with gendered expectations to women as a direct motivation...

How the hell can you talk about gender feels in a nuanced way, if you want to keep gender identity as something sacred, completely separated from the rest of society?

ey3xfsi," Just because some kid sees someone is homosexual/bisexual/transgender/etc. that doesn’t automatically mean they’re going to become that. Being LGBT is not something you can force, just like you can’t force a Christian to become Muslim. It’s something you have to feel. What all this is is kids becoming comfortable and coming out instead of hiding it like the older generations unfortunately had to whether to maintain their job, their status, or just so they won’t be hurt or killed. What looks like “the gays corrupting and influencing the youth” is in fact those kids seeing that they are finally being accepted as they are, instead of being shunned and ostracized like they were in the past. All of this coming out and increase of LGBT youth is a great thing, because it shows we are becoming more accepting as a community and less people are living in fear or with hate for themselves or others hate towards them. So no, this does not warrant further study, doing so would merely show that those doing the study feel these youth are unnatural or are an anomaly, which they/we most certainly are not.

ey3xiax,"It's a weird phenomenom that needs a serious study behind it, I had been addicted to transsexual porn for like 22 years, but only got into the gay porn after a couple years on streaming sites, and they became the mainstream purveyor of porn like what? 10 years ago?


It went from crossdressers to femboys about 6 years ago, I think a lot of it has to do with the interface and easier to dabble into other categories than when it was just the traditional, click on a link and wait for the movie to download/load. This has been the biggest problem for my porn addiction since tabs were invented.


A good analogy I feel is that porn went from McDonalds order system to Chipotle. I've eaten at McDonalds all my life and there are a lot of things on the menu that I've never eaten simply because the live choices aren't in front of me. Meanwhile at Chitpotle I've eaten way more combinations of things there than I have ever eaten at McDonalds and I've only been eating Chitpotle for 10 years.


Side note: it can alter your sexuality. During the golden age of craigslist ts hookups(2005-2016) I would routinely walk out of the potential encounter if the the transsexual was too masculine or even if they didn't have breast at one point. I'm talking about being horny, drunk, late night, ready to make bad decisions and I would still *walk* out if the other person was too masculine, or would refuse to let the ts girls ""friend"" join in who was just some crossdresser. These past couple years since dabbling in the gay porn, I have been much more inclusive on my hookups, hooking up with men in wigs dropping more and more standards to the point where I'm like as long as there is no facial or leg hair then we have a deal.


So yeah this buffet style porn that has proliferated is definitely rewiring our brains in a different way than in years past.

### Previous Comment:

From [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender):
> Gender—or the different characteristics that begin to define a person as masculine or feminine—consists of several categories apart from the traditional binary ends of the male/female spectrum.

In other words, a man *is* defined as being male-like, and a woman *is* defined as being female-like, at least for American culture.

And from an [Intro to Sociology textbook](https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter12-gender-sex-and-sexuality/)

> Gender is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with being male or female. Gender identity is the extent to which one identifies as being either masculine or feminine (Diamond 2002).

> ...

> Characteristics of gender, [as opposed to sex], may vary greatly between different societies. For example, in American culture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress or skirt. However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) can be considered masculine. The kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture.

> ...

> The dichotomous view of gender (the notion that one is either male or female) is specific to certain cultures and is not universal. In some cultures, gender is viewed as fluid. In the past, some anthropologists used the term berdache to refer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed and lived as the opposite gender. The practice has been noted among certain Aboriginal groups  (Jacobs, Thomas, and Lang 1997). Samoan culture accepts what they refer to as a “third gender.” Fa’afafine, which translates as “the way of the woman,” is a term used to describe individuals who are born biologically male but embody both masculine and feminine traits. Fa’afafines are considered an important part of Samoan culture.

Basically, there are certain social expectations of what it means to belong to a certain gender. Current western gender norms are somewhat strictly defined by physical sex. Phrases like ""man up"" and ""not very ladylike"" demonstrate that. ""Boys will be boys."" ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.""

Again from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/gender-dysphoria)

> Gender dysphoria (formerly known as gender identity disorder in the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM) is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with another gender and discomfort with one's own assigned gender and sex; in order to qualify for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, these feelings must cause significant distress or impairment. People with gender dysphoria often desire to live in accordance with their gender identity and may dress and use mannerisms associated with the gender with which they identify in order to achieve this goal.

If terms like ""assigned gender"" and ""gender identity"" confuse you, I'll break it down a little.

First, people are people. When you have a survey, and the age ranges are broken up as 18-34, 35-49, 50+, that doesn't mean that there's a big difference between the age 34 and the age 35 people. It's just that there is some kind of division at an arbitrary point. It gets blurrier around the edges, but it's enough to identify a single group.

Those groups are like genders. It's a category like ""man"" or ""woman"" that is somewhat broad, and the differences get blurry at the edges.

Gender identity is a person's own sense of gender, and it's really a continuous spectrum. Same with age. You're not *really* 30 years old, you're 30 years and 5 months and 8 days and 3 hours... but 30 years is the appropriate category for you. You might not be exactly ""woman"" in the same way that you might not be exactly 30 years old, but it might be the appropriate category for you, so you identify as a woman.

Assigned gender is the gender that is assumed for you when you are too young to make a decision. Typically, it's assigned at birth and based on physical sex. If you are male, you are raised as a boy; if female, a girl. When the distress from trying to meet gender standards you aren't comfortable with is so great, and you have a strong sense of being more comfortable with the standards of another gender, that is gender dysphoria as described above.

The term ""transgender"" doesn't exclusively refer to being a female identifying as a ""man"" or a male identifying as a ""woman"". Instead, it's just an umbrella term for any person whose gender identity and how they express that identity doesn't match that person's assigned gender. 

To use the age analogy again, imagine you were taking that same survey, except the categories are only 18-34 and 50+. You, in your 40s, can't really say you belong to either category. The same way, if your gender identity doesn't fall into either ""man"" or ""woman"", you may identify yourself as ""non-binary"" or ""third gender"". You might reject the categories of gender entirely. All of that would fall under the umbrella of ""transgender"".

### New Response:

If you are agender, you don't identify with any gender. To logically not identify with any gender, you must believe that either you are a completely unique person who can't be categorized, or you must reject the concept of gender entirely. 

If you are non-binary, that just means that you reject the concept that there are only two genders. You can think of this as an umbrella term which also encompasses agender. A person who identifies with or supports genders beyond the usual two is non-binary. A person who rejects gender altogether, and in doing so rejects the two usual genders, is also non-binary.",Gender identity,TooAfraidToAsk,What's the difference between agender and non-binary people?,https://reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/cvg6xx/whats_the_difference_between_agender_and/ey3zkom/

ey3zz5s,"The problem is that traits which are perceived by society as ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" are projected onto sex, and it only tends to go in one direction at a time. Even among people who understand that sex and gender are not the same things, there's apparently an unwillingness to take that information to its logical conclusion.

For a not insignificant portion of society, a person's gender identity and/or presentation are either confirmed or overruled by their genitalia. It follows that most people perceive behaviors typical of people with penises as ""masculine,"" and behaviors typical of people with vaginas ""feminine."" We know this is only true in theory though, because it's not up to the individual to decide what is or isn't representative of masculinity/femininity, but rather it's a sort of unwritten mess of generalities and assumptions and caricatures of the anointed prototypical men and women society has chosen to accept at an arbitrary point in time.

What this inevitably leads to is not that a man with ""feminine traits"" is changing masculine stereotypes, but that he is perceived as somehow less of a man. This is not to say that this view conforms in any way to the concept of gender as a spectrum, but that masculinity and femininity are perceived by society to be two totally separate things; a person can only be one at a time, the more masculine you are the higher your man score is, and low scores are obviously bad.

It's an inherent flaw in trying to rigidly define masculinity and femininity at all, since people do not exist in this binary (and truthfully, the binary itself only exists insofar as society props it up, whether willingly or not). These stereotypes are nearly impossible to change because they're next to impossible to define in good faith, *especially* in the context of this topic where we're trying to say that ""positive masculinity"" is an ideal to strive for. Beyond that, even trying to define masculinity and femininity as a binary based on stereotypical traits or behaviors is automatically exclusionary to the vast majority of people, and is...extremely problematic for trans/enby people, and even some neurodivergent people.

My point is that it would be useful to more clearly define ""toxic masculinity"" (and maybe get a do-over on the branding) as the traits and behaviors that are harmful and should be avoided rather than to imply via ""positive masculinity"" that there is one set of traits that are desirable in men (moreso than in women), which will ultimately just recreate the problem in a different way.",gender identity,MensLib,Let's Talk About positive masculinity,https://reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/cvau9g/lets_talk_about_positive_masculinity/ey3zz5s/

To answer your question, though, probably not because cultures with those traditions, like in traditional China, have them to ensure the family name gets passed on to the grandchildren. Since medical transitions can interfere with fertility, it would be self-defeating. Since such cultures are often also homophobic, those trans men wouldn't have approval to marry cis men anyway and so wouldn't have biological children with their approved spouse even if they were still fertile. Even if the cis woman who is forced to pretend to be a trans man in this hypothetical does marry a cis man, that would still be a homosexual marriage in the eyes of the law and the issue of whose family name gets passed on will crop back up, making it self-defeating even when it ""works.""

Like you said, it might be possible to isolate it from horse urine but for that you'd need to do some column chromatography.

However phytoestrogens are much more common, but the most promising one I found is coumestrol, isolated from red clover. It binds to estrace receptors 98% like regular estradiol, but there isn't much research on its efficiency or safety done either. Some say it can be prepared like a tea from red clover flowers and leaves, but it is also soluble in acetone and ethanol, but again its going to be hard to separate it from the other isoflavones and plant proteins that are also soluble in ethanol/acetone.

For others they would not.

Personal choice / personal preference, is the reason you're looking for. 

What you *really* seem to want to know, is ""why that preference, if they have a vagina now?""

Does it function exactly that same? Is it perfectly 1:1 equivalent?

No, and for some people, that will always mean they won't or can't do it, because the attraction is not there.

Think you need to reevaluate your words here. You're saying that religion is somehow biological? That you're either born Christian or Muslim? You're kinda defeating your own purpose here.

>What all this is is kids becoming comfortable and coming out instead of hiding it like the older generations unfortunately had to whether to maintain their job, their status, or just so they won’t be hurt or killed.

>What looks like “the gays corrupting and influencing the youth” is in fact those kids seeing that they are finally being accepted as they are, instead of being shunned and ostracized like they were in the past. 

I made no moral judgments in my comments.

>All of this coming out and increase of LGBT youth is a great thing, because it shows we are becoming more accepting as a community and less people are living in fear or with hate for themselves or others hate towards them. 

I made no moral judgements in my comments - simply pointed out as something becomes more popular people tend to accept it more. You don't seem to disagree, so I have no clue what you're on about.

>So no, this does not warrant further study, 

So, science should only research things that are unpopular or negative?

>...doing so would merely show that those doing the study feel these youth are unnatural or are an anomaly, which they/we most certainly are not.

Imagine if scientists stopped studying all the things laymen didn't want them too just because they were afraid of the answers. Your statement sounds similar to religious ones a millennia ago because they feared that science would destroy God.

>And I want to acknowledge you may disagree completely with what I have just said, in fact I do expect it. 

I would say the majority of scientists and academics would; especially the part about both religion and homosexuality both being based on 'feelings' instead of one having a biological (gay) influence.

> I am just sorry that you feel we are being influenced or are influencing others, when that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Every voluntary human behavior has a genetic and social component. There's entire fields of study based on this phenomenon. In one sentence you've effectively knocked out the entire fields of sociology and psychology and a considerable portion of anthropology. If you think you know better, I'm all ears.

And, I was going to recommend reading up on epigenetic, methylation and gene/protein expression, but I think you'd benefit more from more base courses at this point.  Here's an intersting little read about previous generations influencing our genetics.

And I'm still not injecting any personal feelings, just putting information out there. If you feel attacked by research and science, I'm sorry. That isn't what this is all about.

Gender dysphoria (GD) is the distress a person feels due to their birth-assigned sex and gender not matching their gender identity. People who experience gender dysphoria are typically transgender. Evidence from studies of twins suggests that gender dysphoria not only has psychological causes, but may have biological causes as well.The diagnostic label gender identity disorder (GID) was used by the DSM until its reclassification as gender dysphoria in 2013, with the release of the DSM-5. The diagnosis was reclassified to better align it with medical understanding of the condition and to remove the stigma associated with the term disorder.

For trans men who are pre-top surgery (chest reconstruction) and are too large to go unnoticed, many wear binders. There are various styles of binder, but most are basically a very tight vest or tank top style undershirt that squashes your chest flat. That with a t-shirt and swim trunks is enough for most guys to swim inconspicuously.

Many trans guys also wear packers. These are basically prosthetic flaccid dicks. Though tbh unless you're wearing a tight fitted bathing suit they're often not that necessary to avoid undesired attention, but many guys are more comfortable wearing them.

Trans women can tuck. This is a way of making one's penis and testicles unnoticeable.

ey47unn,"My issue is it gives this connotation of a blanket ""pretrans"" phase. It's terrible when applied to other people, especially those who are just starting to question their gender. I rather people just say they're questioning or not sure, what if they're not trans but GNC? They don't know. So don't apply a label like ""egg"" to them. It'll make them think they MUST be trans and they don't question further.

As a kid I didn't think I was an ""egg"" I just thought I was a tomboy, then I thought I must just be queer, then I thought well maybe I'm GNC, finally came into saying I was a transman when I felt comfortable even though for years I had known I was probably a transman. Not having anyone yell EGG at me helped me form my own identity that doesn't rely on other peoples ideas. I read about each identity, label, and slowly came into my own overtime.

It feels silly to say someone ""Identifies as an egg"" because basically you're saying you're trans and you know but haven't come out to yourself? I don't get that.

But using it to express your pretransition self well okay I ""get it"" but can't we just use words like pretransition and questioning? That said people can label themselves however they want to, they should just be careful not to apply that language to all people who are questioning.

Gender is weird. You can absolutely be in between. And you'll *never* know how you feel on T unless you start it. Maybe you'll like the changes and maybe you won't. But you do owe it to yourself to find what makes you happy. 

You can ask yourself what the consequences are if you do nothing. How would you feel in two months? A year? Two years?

ey497pj,"Very much so. It started in the fourth grade and lasted right until the end, although I’d say middle school was when it was at its worst. 

The worst occasion for me was the time in sixth grade this giant crowd of future cheerleaders/football players surrounded me and one of the girls sort of pushed this cute guy at me and said really loudly that he wanted to by my boyfriend and I remember for a moment I smiled and blushed and then everybody laughed hysterically. The fact that I had smiled made them all think that I had believed them. The blushing definitely gave away that I thought he was cute. They all followed and laughed and shouted shit at me my whole way to class. I was a really shy, quiet kid and that amount of unwanted attention was agonizing. 

I guess the second worst time was my senior year of high school. I had an hour where I was supposed to be a teacher’s aid but that teacher had so many aids that hour that I was never in the classroom with her. One time I was in the library with another kid who was also supposed to be a teachers aid (turns out he was also gay) and a few other people. This girl came and dropped a note onto the table in front of me and rushed back to her friend at another table a few feet away. I opened it and saw “No faggets allowed” written in giant red letters, so the whole table saw it. I shouted “You spelled faggots wrong, dumbass.” at the girl who had dropped the note in front of me and *I* got kicked out of the library for raising my voice. I was so humiliated and outraged at the unfairness of the whole situation. I remember in my next class I just started crying and I couldn’t stop. Like ugly, my mom just died crying. I was sitting in the front row and I had to walk past the whole class to the back of the room where the door was in order to leave. It was horrible.

And likewise a man who decides to wear makeup and do traditionally feminine things is not a trans woman. James Charles for example does exactly that and still identifies as a cis man.

Gender is constructed from a mental state in which one perceives themselves as a man, woman, both, or somewhere in between. It has nothing to do with traditional gender roles. In fact, transgender people exist in societies that have different opinions on gender roles and often times do not conform their chosen gender identity with the traditional roles of that gender. Sometimes they do, but sometimes they don't.

So, if refusing to date a transgender person is prejudicial, then there must be no difference between a transgender person and a cisgender person that is relevant to deciding who to date.

ey4cv1q,"I've heard of him, but only because I like to follow US politics. I doubt many Europeans know who Elizabeth Warren is, much less Andrew Yang.

And let's get this out of the way right now: he's not gonna win the primary. The UBI is too weird to catch on, and he has no charisma to non-Internet people. He's the Ron Paul of 2020, except he has even less name recognition.

Personally, I think he has some good policies and can talk about them clearly and concisely, like a lot of the Democratic candidates. However, I don't currently support the UBI, and I don't know much about his foreign policy other than the generic ""stop being the world police"" stuff which almost every candidate agrees with.

One thing I'd like to highlight: from a European perspective, it's very weird that you guys don't see much of a problem with lack of political experience in a candidate. And on top of that, you have this fascination with ""businessmen."" Donald Trump's main thing (besides the racism and xenophobia) is being a ""successful businessman."" Andrew Yang presents himself in much the same way.

A thought about the whole slew of candidates, and the dynamics of the race: it's too much about identity. Not just racial or gender identity, identity of everything. A military veteran, a gay military veteran, a person whose parents were blue collar workers, a person that lives in a community affected by gun crime, etc. etc.

For a group that's always going on and on about how policy is more important than other things, they sure do spend a lot of time talking about their life stories, their parent's life stories, how every issue affects them personally, generally how their *identity* makes them the right person for the job, instead of their competency and their ideology.

ey4cv3k,"Abigail,

I confess with my own tongue that when I was younger, I didn't understand LGBT issues and I thought that transgender people had something wrong with them.  It was what I was taught growing up.  I professed it because that was what was expected of me.  Since those days, I have become much better at being a good human.

You apparently got involved in a hateful, bigoted, racist family because you wanted someone to love you and you thought that if you looked the other way for certain things, it would turn out okay.  You were wrong.  I wish you could have realized sooner, but as far as I am concerned, you have paid far more than enough for the mistake you made.

I did see the update you posted on your GoFundMe page for your legal defense fund.  It is astounding how hateful this woman is who once pledged to love you for the rest of her life.

I'm trying to be a good ally to you, but at the same time, I do realize that I'm offering you unsoliticed advice.

First, I think that Abigail is a beautiful name for someone like yourself who didn't like the name you were given at birth.  You've previously asked if you thought that a protection order is appropriate.  Frankly, from my point of view, you'd have to be insane to not pursue a protection order.  As that other redditor said in your other thread, you need to document the different ways that your ex-wife harasses you.  It is astounding that this woman so brazenly harasses you and then tells you that you should plan to go to jail because she is the one engaging in reprehensible conduct, and you should know that people DO GO TO JAIL for violating these protection orders, so that could be on her!

I saw that you mentioned on your legal defense fund update that she sends you hateful messages on a regular basis.  I would suggest simply blocking her, or at the very least destroying/deleting her messages without reading them unless there is some reason you need to know what she is saying to you.  It sounds like you've already documented the harassing nature of her messages.

I did a quick Google search and see that Illinois is normally considered a ""two party consent state"", but new policy says that when a conversation is in a public place with no expectation of privacy, you can record it.  So, I would think that this means that if she's following you around screaming, you can record her and then show it to the court to obtain or enforce a protection order.  See here: http://www.familylawtopics.com/2015/01/private-conversations-protected-new-illinois-eavesdropping-law/

And remember that I am not a lawyer.  I would definitely take a closer look at all this.  I know you're exhausted, but no one else can fight for you.

I know that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, but I recently told my dad that he isn't welcome to visit, call, or write anymore because of his hateful attitude, and so he sent me a letter with an obviously fake return address.  The state on the return address didn't even match the state on the postmark.  I simply threw out his letter without reading it to deny him the opportunity to hurt me.  I suggest denying your ex-wife every opportunity to hurt you.

I'm simply trying to say that if you're receiving hateful messages from her, you're only giving her the chance to hurt you by reading them.

It sounds like your property manager knows that she is harassing other tenants, so he should be an ally to you for practical purposes; he should want her off *his* property.  And I did see the recent comment about your boss being helpful, so I suspect that he should help protect you from harassment at work by blocking her from calling you, or perhaps providing phone records you can use in court to obtain and enforce a protection order.

I can't help but wonder if the lawyer you previously hired might have been incompetent or simply neglectful of his duties to you.  It sounds like he simply allowed your ex-wife to haul you into court repeatedly, running the clock for billable hours until you couldn't pay him anymore.  It sounds like there should have been a clear-cut case that your ex-wife is abusing the court system and your lawyer should have been able to point that out.

I would be asking the legal self-help desk that you previously mentioned what you can do to bring these legal proceedings to a close.  It sounds like the state of Illinois has mercifully implemented clear guidelines for support payments, so I would think that there ought to be a simple way to interpret the law and then demand that the proceedings be brought to a close because I cannot see how there is any legal basis for your case to be dragged out forever.

But perhaps the most important thing right now is that you need to remember that you're a member of a community.  Even if no one here can hold your hand thru this, we want to be with you in spirit so that you know that you are not alone in facing this hate.  It sounds like you know well that your ex-wife may call herself a ""Christian"", but she does not conduct herself in a Christ-like way!

ey4ddci,">Respectfully, how is the ""I like stuff"" argument different from saying that because men enjoy their privilege that they should be allowed to keep it regardless of its repeatedly demonstrated consequences?

Let me make it clear that I'm not talking about privilege here. I'm talking about sharing common values and experiences with an extremely large group of people.

When Contra was saying ""I like stuff"", she's espousing that maybe the complete annihilation of capitalism is not the answer because a lot of the things we enjoy are direct results of capitalism. Likewise, complete annihilation of gender roles might inadvertently erase a piece of culture and social interaction that we enjoy today because it is a direct result of having genders.

ey4ddf7,">I've seen many animals afraid of adult males but not women or children. Animals all need the instinct to tell males from females for safety and reproductive reasons. The fact that everyone wants to act like this doesn't exist is so stupid.

Thanks for that. It's fucking vindicating to see someone else say what I've said many times (less eloquently, as I was fumbling for a way to explain why it seems obvious to me that it is *a* *survival instinct* to ""be transphobic"") only to be met with uncomfortable silence and pained, pitying looks. 

Seriously. At what point did we go from Bible-thumping Gavin DeBecker's *The Gift of Fear,* which urges women to listen to their fear instead of dismissing it as just their imagination /  prejudices / internal racism, to using their fear as a way of demeaning them? I must have been on vacation. 

If I'm in the room with a man, I need to know, and that applies even if he's had all the important plumbing shaved off and carved up. He still will react to different things than women will, and he'll react in different ways, and while his socialization is hopelessly entangled in who he is, it's still biologically based. And when he reacts, he is by default a much bigger threat to me than almost any woman. You would take the same precautions if you're a zookeeper who had to be around a pride of lions, say. I don't care how docile leo seems, don't you *ever* forget leo's a male. 

When I'm told I *should* just accept what people tell me about themselves as fact, what I hear them saying that I need to ignore my fears. I should ignore what my gut tells me, they're saying, even though that ""gut feeling"" is a selected-for characteristic in my species' survival because people who got it and obeyed it lived to reproduce. But I'm supposed to chuck all of this, ignore it, because *you* have been brainwashed into believing a man who calls himself a woman is now magically a woman and therefore no threat to me.

ey4deb7,"Hey y'all! I'm working with an otorhinolaryngologist who's become a facial plastic surgeon here in Mexico City. We've been getting into the practice of facial feminization surgery for transgender patientsm and this surgeon I work with has been working really hard to improve considerably. I was his first FFS patient (Type 3 forehead feminization, rhinoplasty and thyroid cartillage reduction) and volunteered as a beta tester for the frontoplasty. The results were adequate, although we noticed many things that could be improved about the forehead work.

This feedback was applied into some cadaver testing and it helped a lot with another two patients he had to do a frontoplasty on (One to remove an osteoma in the frontal sinus and another one for type 3 forehead reconstruction last Thursday. This last one went pretty well and I reckon he's learned a lot since mine). So much so that another world renowed FFS surgeon he's friends with praised my doc's work on the forehead through Instagram.

Now, we've been looking at a course this organization called [Facial Team](https://facialteam.eu/training-education/ffs-surgery-program/) offers in Marbella Spain. The doc was part of the first webinar they ever organized in 2018 for trans facial surgery, and they personally invited the doc to the FFS training course in Spain, but we didn't have the resource for that at the time.

We are looking into enrolling to this course, but the problem is how much they're charging: Around $26,000 USD for ONE WEEK (Link to download last year's course [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z9xfuahua1ix3ml/FFS%20Training%20Program_October%202018.pdf?dl=0)). We are located in Mexico and, the doc has always trained in public universities (Which here are completely free of charge) and been able to get scholarships (Full or partial) for high level specializations. We do question whether it's worth investing into this or not. 

So, in your opinion, is it worth taking this course for him?

The progressive laws like abortions are not really challenged, or at least not seriously challenged.

He didn't even get 10% of what he needed for the petition to be considered for the referendum.

Healthcare is not really a complaint. Several hospitals have opened recently and they are world class. Education, however, has been on a downward spiral for 20 years as crime went on the rise. This November, we'll have a new president, and the decade will be decided on whether they keep their ""education up, crime down"" promises or if they'll chicken out. I have faith that education will improve, but it is true that it is at a point that action must be taken immediatly. Thankfully, it's getting the attention it deserves, unlike other pressing matters ^^^*cough* ^^^climate ^^^change ^^^*cough*.

I was gonna start with a witty joke about how ""It's the price you pay for living in the Switzerland of the south"", but it's true, the costs of living are high, and with unemployment on the rise, it seems like it will become a problem sooner than later. Economic growth has been stopping, but with the new investments in the cellulose industry, I think it will go up soon. At the central bank, economists are working harder than ever to keep the Uruguayan peso from falling down the ladder the Argentinean peso fell, and they've been doing the best they can. I just hope that the next government can deregulate the economy enough for the cost of living to go down and the economy to get in full motion once again.",transgender,asklatinamerica,"Uruguayan citizens, what's your take on your current government?",https://reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/cvhrev/uruguayan_citizens_whats_your_take_on_your/ey4dnfi/
ey4dvee,"The Star Wars pen and papers (Age of Rebellion and Edge of Empire were the ones I played, but I think there were one or two more) had a good system for the idea of non-binary outcomes for rolls.

The first affects if you actually succeed in what you’re trying to do, and the second affect any positive or negative consequences directly related to whatever that action was. 

So you can fail a speech check but if you roll a high advantage perhaps the guy takes sympathy on you because they think your simple (for ex) and helps you in a different way.

>My point is that it would be useful to more clearly define ""toxic masculinity"" (and maybe get a do-over on the branding) as the traits and behaviors that are harmful and should be avoided rather than to imply via ""positive masculinity"" that there is one set of traits that are desirable in men (moreso than in women), which will ultimately just recreate the problem in a different way.

Definitely agree with almost any call to change the branding on toxic masculinity because too much of the discourse is based on clarifying the meaning or correcting it. 


In a broader sense, what I took away from reading your post was that ""society views masculinity and femininity on a spectrum, and being one makes you less of the other"" and that rings extremely true to me. It also seems very problematic because, as you pointed out, men acting in a way different then how masculinity is arbitrarily defined just makes them not masculine. It does NOT redefine masculinity.


> Beyond that, even trying to define masculinity and femininity as a binary based on stereotypical traits or behaviors is automatically exclusionary to the vast majority of people, and is...extremely problematic for trans/enby people, and even some neurodivergent people.

This reminds me of what someone on another sub was telling me (in criticism to contrapoints' video) that 

>  I also don't agree with her whole take on there needing to be a new model ""masculinity"" for men to invent for themselves when transmen, transmasculine, and queer men have been performing their own versions of masculinity forever. Are they not included in this convo? Are they not ""her boys"" too?


It is interesting to consider here that you talked about how a sizeable chunk of people base gender on genitalia and honestly those people probably don't consider ""transmen, transmasculine, or queer people"" when they conceive of masculinity at all.

[PFLAG](https://pflag.org/needsupport) for example might provide support and they may also help explain to parents.

And some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.

Aros and Aces go through a lot of the same crap. The world in general does not understand us.  We have an advantage in that the only people that really need to know our identity are people seeking ""more than friendship"", so we don't have to be out to everybody the way the other LGBTQ world does.

When we were children, my sister (trans, MtF) and I were very close.

For some reason, I don’t know why, but once I was 8 years old, she started molesting me. This lasted for three years. Once I started to visibly reach puberty, she stopped. She didn’t seem to think there was anything wrong with what she was doing, and if she did, she still did it. 

Now, she has severe anxiety and depression, blaming the world for her problems, her issues, her bad decisions. She’s in a polyamorous relationship and gets incredibly jealous (defeats the purpose of a polyamorous relationship) and territorial with her partners.

ey4gcws,">Feels like just ignoring these thoughts and focusing on improvement is not a beneficial strategy since these thoughts will re-emerge later. 

""The only way out is through."" Robert Frost. I struggled with self-image issue for a very long time because I grew a mustache instead of boobs when puberty begins. Yes, I was born a female, and I even had gender identity issue for a while because of this. Also I get hit by girls more than from guys. Guys thought I was intimidating, but girls thought I was reliable as a guy, but with a ""soft""(I don't even know what they mean by ""soft"") touch like a girl. But luckily, I grew a pair of boobs now, and my mustache pretty much gone now! 

Anyways, let's focus back to you. I was having issue with self-image, and have no self-esteem whatsoever. But I met my great friends who's lectured me lots of valuable lesson over the course of our friendships. I'd like to share with you a little bit of what I've learned from them.

* Find out your abilities and master them. Build your self-esteem by demonstrating what you can do, and to do it with your best ability to achieve a mastery level. 
* Stop brutal self-criticism and introduce self-compassion. You know there's truth to, ""You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar."" Treat yourself as if you'll treat anybody else. Would you criticize them as badly as you do to yourself? You wouldn't with a sane mind, right? 
* Affirm your real worth, and use healthy positive affirmation correctly everyday. Have you ever heard of a quote by Tony Gaskins, “If you don't build your dream someone will hire you to help build theirs.”? Same goes for your sense of self-worth. You set your own worth, and only you should have the authority to do that. Or else, someone else will set your worth for you, and chances are they won't set it as high as you should be getting. And remember not all positive affirmations we hear on social medias will be positive for everyone (I think the popular positive affirmations only works for those with high self-esteem already), so you make up your own positive affirmation that will really helps you value yourself more. And say it everyday, every time you need some cheering up. Be your own supporter, be your own hero, be your own cheerleader. You can do it!
* Learn to accept compliments gracefully, and give compliment genuinely. The painful irony of low self-esteem is that we tend to be almost compliments proof when we needs compliments the most. So, make it appoint to gracefully accept compliments even if they make you feel uncomfortable, and do not let them affects your ego. And learn how to give compliments genuinely and appropriately.",gender identity,isfp,Has anyone here with low self confidence found a way to improve it?,https://reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/cvdamu/has_anyone_here_with_low_self_confidence_found_a/ey4gcws/

ey4gefj,"I think one thing to keep in mind when it comes to all this is that... like the late 90's, we're in the middle of a large wave of a ""Revolution"" at least when it comes to Gender. The younger generations and teens are to a phase where they're just willing to say they are what they are for instance, there's more exposure in the end to the fact that Trans is a thing. That's leading older generations to suddenly be able to toss off old classifications that have always sat really badly with them, such as Transmen being forced to try to live with the ""Tomboy"" archetype, or Transwomen with Crossdressing fetish stuff, so we're seeing what seems like a boom of people ""Chosing"", but in the end it's mostly a dropping of old pretenses to realize what you've been lying to yourself for years about. This in the end can come off as a ""Fad"" because of how many people it feels like are coming out about it, Even for me, I'm surprised that 3 of my very close friends from highschool are ALSO trans, and we only just reconnected recently after not having talked for over ten years to eachother, so it's been quite interesting.

Personally, I'm one of these later generations who is suddenly able to stop giving themselves grief about who they are. I was personally too long isolated and indoctinated into the fact that my hatred of my own body and dislike over the roles of my gender were easily brushed off with just being said to be a tomboy. I couldn't point back in time and say, like some of them can that I was a ""Boy"" in a girl's body from a lower age, but reflection shows things that point to it. Such as me chopping off all my hair whenever I'd come across scissors. Me stripping down and wearing my older brother's clothes instead of mine. Trading my barbies for a friend's GI Joes, or even mutilating and burning my own girls toys in frustration, never liking or understanding makeup, always being one of the boys, going out and catching snakes, building forts, and doing general boy stuff, but it NEVER crossed my mind in any of those instances that I wanted to be a boy. I just never really understood or saw the difference for some reason, and it took a really big more recent shakeup to make me go ""huh"" and start looking things up myself, as well as a ton of retrospective looking back on the past.

With that said, yes, there definitely are people who use sexuality and gender as a fad, but we should never try to gatekeep it from them in the end.

Much of the incel related stuff is basically statement that they are owed sex, and is often expressed as pro-rape or some other form of sexual subjugation.

If a trans woman feels straight men dont want to have sex with her because she is trans, then that suggests they dont see her as a woman, which could be felt as a rebuttal of how they identify themself.

I don't think it's ultimately healthy to feel that way, but I can understand why one might feel that way.

Not strictly. Many trans people experience gender dysphoria due to living as and/or having a body of the 'wrong' sex. This causes a lot of psychological distress, which is what classifies it as a mental illness. Transition is the cure, after which they are no longer mentally ill.

Gender dysphoria is also observed in non-trans people who have to live as another gender for whatever reason (for safety during wartime, etc). If this causes them a lot of psychological distress, they would also be considered mentally ill by the same criteria.

Other trans people don't experience much or any distress in the first place, but would just be happier as another sex.

“When we look at the transgender brain, we see that the brain resembles the gender that the person identifies as,” Dr. Altinay says. For example, a person who is born with a penis but ends up identifying as a female often actually has some of the structural characteristics of a “female” brain.”

""*The straight scene with drugs? There are drugs everywhere but on a real note bro find your true self if you don't like it check out men, dude.  See what it's like and check back in.*""

If you reject this outright and don't even give it a thought (let alone try it), that's OK -- it can either mean you're really straight or you might still be averse to it because you are insecure about yourself.

Likewise, I haven't tried going the bi way; I like female friends, but I don't feel attraction. At all. A sexual experience with them would leave them deeply unsatisfied and me frustrated. (And just because this is the Internet and someone was kind enough to mark this post as NSFW \[which I didn't understand it could be, so I apologize\] but not kind enough to deem it worthy of interaction \[which is rude and offensive\], I'll share something else -- I was also approached by a trans woman and she dropped to her knees and performed oral on me; I watched it and felt *no physical reaction whatsoever*. That makes it pretty clear to me that I'm not sexually attracted to women, or female bodies. To each his own, I guess.)

Thus... I don't really think that I'm ready to try and explore bisexuality. But seeing as psychology understands today that we can be ""sexually fluid"", maybe in a foreseeable future? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

Right now, I'm seeking ways to make this sex addiction NOT become self-destructive (or perhaps, no more than it might be already) and downsize it to something healthier, something that cannot be described as a vice or an addiction. I don't think I can either repress it, suppress it or deny it --- attempting to do so would only make the urges stronger, more aggressive or uncontrollable. It is a base instinct, therefore I can't attempt to just make-believe that I don't need or want sex (you want to see how troublesome that is? Just look up child molesters and religious people who abused children).

There has to be a better way. Backed by scientifical research and datasets. And I'm going to find it.

I was worried before going in that it would still feel like my penis, since the material is used, but I suppose the rearranging of the nerves, removal of the erectile tissue, creation of the cavity / removal of the corpus cavernosa, and so on changes my brain's reaction to it completely.

There was a time it felt like a tight tuck, but I can't remember quite when... I think it was right after the vaginal stent was removed a few days after surgery. It went away quickly enough that I can't remember anything but it happening.

The surgeon I went to, Dr Brassard, actually advises *against* hair removal altogether as he destroys the hair follicles as part of the surgery. If hair removal isn't complete, that makes it harder to see the follicles and ensure they're removed. If the laser isn't perfect, you'll end up with more hair in your vagina than if you had done nothing. I have no hair in there.

Oddly enough, when I considered starting hrt and transitioning.

""But-"" You may think, that goes AFTER one realizes they is trans. I know, but trust me, it happened that way.

Roughly 10 years prior to breaking the shell I started to get interested girl clothes, makeup, etc. That sort of cute things. The mangas whit cute boys that crossdress and made me envious were to blame. Anyway, I created a small parcel of my private life to experiment, and it was good.

Fast forward 8 years that parcel had grow and slowly creeped into some parts of my life. At this point I started to identify as gender fluid, where ones gender gradually oscillates between masculine and feminine (now I know this is called genderflux, btw). It explained a lot. My experiences of the previous years were part of my gender identity, not just a weird liking.

2 years later, a post by a trans girl in 4chan made think. About how my feminine gender expression can't outgrow my private life, no matter what I may do, because cisnormativity. And that I wanted more. Then I thought ""Why not?"" and started to view the transition as a viable option. Why I had not done it earlier? Because up to this point it was something so hard, so unreachable to be taken seriously. And that as EveryOneKnows(TM) trans people as gender dysphoria, but I dint had it.

I started to brainstorm all the implications and their possible solutions. And all of them bringed me a feeling of excitement. Then I tried to think of the same things, but from a masculine perspective (obviously only the applicable ones, like losing some weight or buying a better-looking set of clothes). This time they only bringed me apathy, the same apathy as always. Shortly after the realization hit me like a freight train.

I was drowning in excitement, it was literally the most intense emotion that I had felt in my whole life. To the point of crying if I thought a bit too much about it. And it not really started to fade until 2 weeks later.",gender identity,traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,"for me it was your name, but im interested in your stories",https://reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/cuc6cr/for_me_it_was_your_name_but_im_interested_in_your/ey4n3ds/

The fact is that the identical situation can affect two different people completely differently. Pretending it doesn't won't help and won't change the situation. So while you might like the idea of gender neutral bathrooms because it's a more efficient allocation of plumbing, the lack of them probably won't be anything more than a very mild annoyance to you. It can be critical to the safety and well-being of someone else.   


So saying that you don't care and don't want to hear about it comes off as not really caring that trans women who are visibly identifiable as trans women face real threats of violence in some places for being in the wrong bathroom *no matter which bathroom they choose*.

I try to adjust my behaviour so that I do not change my behaviour according to these attributes. Why would this make me a bbad person?

Because when I said that I'm for ""gender neutral bathrooms"", not because of gender, but because I  think it is stupid to dedicate a identically equipped room to certain group. I'm against the idea of men's, women's, gender neutral bathrooms.

I think everyone should have the same rights in front of the law and law should be written sex, gender and sexuality neutral.

You clearly didn't intend any harm, but it's possible you caused some anyway, and you should apologize for that. Not for your actions, but for their unintended consequences.

As you seem to already know, transphobia is real and incredibly damaging to trans folks. Even the mistaken perception of mockery or derision can be incredibly hurtful to trans people, and makes other transphobes feel justified in their bigotry. 

Best course of action would be to post on your story saying something to the effect of ""I didn't intend any mockery or harm in that post, i just thought the image was cute and a fun celebration of trans people and this gender-nonconforming character who i love.

ey4oe1z,"Ohhh yeah. Internalized fat-phobia dysphoria is definitely part of MY history. Actually, I kind of have less fat-phobia as a trans-masc than I did as a female? I don't know why... I think it may have had something to do with the 'taking up space' mentality, where women are supposed to be small, in terms of impact, amount of time spent talking, etc. I always felt like I had on giant clown-shoes and I was just smashing through everybody's little eggshell feelings... But as a dude, it's more socially acceptable to be take-charge and assertive and suchlike. I feel like the role of dude-in-charge is something I've always inhabited, but with this ""new body"" (in quotes because it's different a little, but not brand-spankin-new) everyone ELSE is more comfortable with me taking on that role. He's the boss, she's just bossy. I really do hate that piece of our culture, that women aren't looked at to lead just as naturally. Some men are not cut out for leadership, and some women /are/! Just cuz I happen to be a /man/ who was cut out for leading, doesn't invalidate that! :D (I mean, I say leading, but that's in an ideal world where I have, like, minions or something. Employees. Followers. Apostles? Something like that. XD)

Then when I started to transition, I realized my overall chubbiness was making it /easier/ for me to pass, since dudes of a certain weight have man-boobs, and I wear sports bras for binding that work really well. So I just looked dude-chubby! It was kind of a revelation to me, that if I'd born with much skinnier genes, I wouldn't have had that blessing.

I have gained weight, being on T. Got that increased appetite and all. I was about a size 18 in women's pants before T - at that size, 10 pounds here or there doesn't make your clothes un-wearable (another advantage chubbiness has over skinniness) so I haven't actually /had/ to buy all-new clothes. Plus, my t- shirts even look better on me now, cuz the weight I gained /was like all muscle/. I've probably lost some inches of fat around my waist. I think it migrated into my /neck/, which is not super-amazing, but still!

I've actually joined the gay men's chorus in my city, so I'm learning how to be a gay man from a whole bunch of white, chubby, late-baby-boomer guys. (I was recruited as part of an effort to make their singer-base younger and more racially-and-gender-identity-ly diverse. It worked, too, they got in a ton of new people, and like 3 more black guys! Which is a huge increase, since they had 2 before, out of like 60.) 'S been a great way to make friends. Guaranteed to see them every week! There's actually an engaged pair in the chorus who look /exactly the same/, it's ridiculous! They're both bald, chubby, under 5'8"", with earrings and full beards. They have differing levels of extraversion, I've noticed. It's kind of heartening to see the zest for life of the darker-haired one, who's bouncy and camp and really positive all the time. The longer we're together as a singing group, the more open they all get about talking about their sex lives, so I /hear things/. (bouncing eyes emoji) 

It's definitely true that there are real people, real gay guys, out there in the city with all sorts of experiences and levels of libido and preferences and such. Basically everyone will agree on who's ""cute"" but that's just the lowest common denominator - everyone has their own individual preferences too!",gender-identity,gaytransguys,Dealing with internalised fatphobia as a queer trans-masc person,https://reddit.com/r/gaytransguys/comments/cqqlcv/dealing_with_internalised_fatphobia_as_a_queer/ey4oe1z/

ey4onhq,"It's not that much that ""One Piece sucks hard on that aspect"" but rather that japanese culture already conditions people to alienate the things they see as different, standing out in almost any way in japan usually will end up in you being marginalized and ignored, that's why the almost all ""representations"" of LGTBQ+ people you find in anime is fetished (to make a profit) or making it look like it's the most normal thing ever (ignoring the fact that irl there are bigger issues around this than just ""boy likes boy"" or ""girl likes girl"").

I actually applaud Oda for being able to make the kind of representation he gives in One Piece given the culture around him, he presents them in a way you can not possibly ignored them, he makes it clear they are more than just a weird fashion trend or something like that, they are very clearly not a fetish, but also are not necessarily undesirable, he introduces Ivankov to introduce people to the concept of transitioning (the first time I've ever seen the concept in an anime), he stablishes that their identity as trans people is a thing and that it's not something considered normal in their wolrd, and therefor showing that there are other issues around it, he even acknowledges non-binary people (Inazuma is subtly but clearly presented as genderfluid, there are many scenes were they have a masculine body at one moment and a femenine one on another, showing that their identity is constantly fluctuating).

Yeah, it can be misinterpreted by many people, and it is, but I think it's better to have something like this, which can be good or bad, than having close to nothing, at least One Piece helps doesn't alienate the topic and ignores it, but rather adresses it and allows the reader to make themselves and opinion of it.",non-binary,MemePiece,A surprise to be sure,https://reddit.com/r/MemePiece/comments/cv8obk/a_surprise_to_be_sure/ey4onhq/

ey4onon,"**Street harassment**

Street harassment is a form of harassment, primarily sexual harassment that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking,

wolf-whistlings, catcalling, exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation.According to an article by the non-profit organization Stop Street Harassment, street harassment does not only include actions or comments that have a sexual connotation. Street harassment can include homophobic and transphobic slurs, and other hateful comments referencing race, religion, class, and disability. Harassment can also include persistent requests for someone's name, number, destination, or other personal information after the victim has already denied requests, as well as public masturbation and flashing. Stop Street Harassment states that someone could be harassed for multiple different reasons within the same instance of harassment.

ey4p3q6,"Guys, I'm so scared right now. It's because after discovering this sub on a whim, it seems a lot like I'm trans and it absolutely terrifies me. I've been freaking out the whole day about it. I'm shaking and I keep feeling like I'm going to throw up. I don't know why the thought of being trans horrifies me so much but it does. I don't want to be trans. I don't i dont. I need to vent and get some comforting words

Basically, (I'm male btw) right around the time of middle school I developed this love and fascination for girls. The progression of it was at that time I started developing severe social anxiety and all my friends started leaving me at that time too. I always chalked up getting this fascination of girls from the fact that all guys obviously love girls, and my love for them just got accentuated from being lonely, really wanting to have a girlfriend and just having the urge of wanting to talk to girls in general and unable to do any of that from my social anxiety. It seems natural to be fascinated with girls after wanting to be close to them and not being able to. After developing this, I started to play as girls in video games, my logic for that being that since my social anxiety prevents me from talking to girls, this is closest I'll get and that's why i thought it felt good. I always get happy when a game or show or movie im watching has a female lead and would get more attached to them. Again I assumed it was from this creepy love for girls I had. I really like cute stuff. I get off to the idea of wearing makeup or dressing in drag for fun but i've never done it. And probably the most egregious example of them all, as a way of helping sleeping I imagine myself being in the world of a movie or game I love, and during that I would imagine myself being a girl sometimes. I haven't done it in a while though (if that even fucking helps.) I thought that this was all just for just having a creepy fascination of girls, but explaining all this to being trans makes way too much sense. I'm so scared that I feel like im going to cry.

But at the same time, I am not dysphoric about being a guy at all. AT ALL. I recently was able to grow a beard after wanting to all my life and I love how I look and I'm getting so confident from it. I really want to get a tattoo sleeve, and I like the idea of looking mean and badass from it. I like mens fashion and clothing, I don't wish that I was able to wear girls clothes or fashion at all. I like having a dick. I only watch straight porn and never imagine myself being the girl. Back when I had friends, I had only guy friends and was way more comfortable with talking to guys. That's the case even now, I have a much easier time talking with guys even nowadays. And I also get really nervous around girls, which doesn't make much sense if I'm a woman. 

Really, I don't have a single issue being a guy at all. Really, i don't. I like my body. It just feels good to be girly too. Could I be non binary?

I feel like I'm starting to a feel a little less anxious now, and I really need to relax after freaking out all day. I may not read any responses until tomorrow.

ey4p92p,"> I feel as though it has become ""trendy"" to essentially not be straight, though.

You are not wrong.  Some of this is more acceptance but some if this is the fact that we kind of fetishize some of it these days.  In progressive circles you 100% have more social cache from being gay, lesbian, non-binary, or trans.  

Years ago the LGBTQ community was a bit more cohesive but these days there is kind of an unofficial hierarchy about your social standing in progressive society that closely follows intersectional thought.  It basically goes Trans > Non-binary > lesbians > ~~gay men~~ nope, problematic and blamed for negative LGBTQ stereotypes > ~~bisexuals~~ greedy traitors > ~~Asexuals~~ what?.  But all are still valued more than the dreaded cis people who often get seen as the enemy by LGBTQ folks who have a chip on their shoulder for one reason or another.  

LGBTQ may appear pretty cohesive from the outside but inside it often splinters into bickering factions until we gather together against an outside threat.  [Threads like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cchzhb/lgbtq_people_what_are_you_tired_of_hearing/?depth=1) show clearly how much gatekeeping/judgement is against some of the ""lower tier"" factions like bisexuals so you know I'm not just blowing smoke here.  

&nbsp;

For context my view on this is based on being in the LGBTQ community for 20ish years now.  I become a furry when a teenager and that introduced me to the LGBTQ community since furries have been 2/3rds LGBTQ since their inception in the 70's.  This led to me either becoming or realizing that I'm bisexual.  I think for me personally it was a natural evolution of thought rather than the usual ""born with it"".  Thanks to the unique accepting atmosphere of furries and the presence of fursonas and fursuits we ended up being a pretty safe place for trans and I think my first use of different pronouns to someone's sex was like in 2005.  But there wasn't near as much the socio-political emotional baggage LGBTQ has attached to it today back then.  We didn't really have much power and influence so we just wanted acceptance, then we got it, then we got social power, and today we often demonstrate that we can misuse our power just as much as every other group that's gotten power.

&nbsp;

> I may be way off the mark, but I have encountered more than a couple people who I would say essentially decide to not be straight.  

You are very much not off the mark but not everyone that ends up that way is just being trendy.  Some people are honestly experimenting or transitioning.  A few folks like me are not born with an innate pull to the same sex but are not naturally repulsed by it either.  As I learned and understood more I became more open to the idea of bisexuality and became one.  This is relatively uncommon though.  I essentially logically dismantled every reason I had to not be ok with it and that grew into a ""sure whatever"" and that grew into a ""it's fun"" lol :P.

However there are still a large amount of people who are just kind of jumping onto social trends.  Either by deciding to be gay or by trying to ""upsell"" how gay they are.  It's just normal human stuff honestly.  Trying to fit in, trying to adapt into a changing society in a way that helps ensure your success, etc.  For example at some of the most progressive companies, you are actually advantaged and celebrated to be LGBTQ.  Non-binary also provides a route for those who are not comfortable with being gay/lesbian but still want to ride the trend.

But again, it's all nuanced and case by case.  A great deal of people are pursuing it honestly and some people are not.  Knowing which is which is difficult.  And I don't assume dishonesty on an individual basis unless there is significant evidence.  Even then I don't typically assume malice, people are just trying to survive and thrive in a changing landscape.

You'll get different answers based on if you hear people talk in the individual cliques and discords and subreddits vs if you hear them talk publicly.

So I use my years and years of credibility-building and being an undeniably tolerant and loving person to gently introduce the idea that trans activism is pushing for things most individual trans people are not, that women's rights are being eroded, that as a parent I'm worried about some (not all) of the ""trans kids"" I know, and why... I talk about the freedom I felt when I first found ""gender is such bullshit"" feminism as a lifelong tomboy and how that helped me be happy with myself, and how the new doctrine - ""gender is everything"" - would have been so damaging to a girl like me, and how I see it being damaging to young people today... I'm careful who I speak to and when and where I speak and I don't write anything GC in correspondence, but I've 'converted' plenty of people (or at least, helped them be brave enough to say ""I agree"") and I guess it helps that I still have close trans friends, most from the older generation who seem to hate this TRA nonsense even more than most of us here...

exzwool,"So a few things:

First, that paper is fairly well known. Not everyone agrees with the ethics surrounding it, and it was written before the advent of IRBs.

Also, the paper doesn’t describe an attempt to “deprogram” someone.(Such usage suggests a misunderstanding of the word *program* in regards to behavioral science.) It describes a scientific experiment about influencing a specific set of behaviors. The fact that the environment-behavior relations remained after 3 years is much more suggestive of the environmental contingencies, than the experiment itself.

Second, the site you referenced appears to be one for a non-scientific audience. I say this because, amongst other things, it contains many overly-broad statements about therapy in general.

Aversion therapy is not behavioral science.  It is taking one principle and applying it in an unscientific manner.  In effect, this description of aversion therapy is like most pop-psych sources: they’re trying to fit a misunderstanding of science, to the story they want to tell.

So one paper, and a pop-psychology website hardly constitute “a history”.

ey4ptep,"> Am I situationally gay? I was talking to my wife of 10 years, me being what I consider to be a straight male, anyway we were talking about transgender issues and she in a purely hypothetical way asked me if she came to me one day and said she felt she was in the wrong body and took the steps to transition etc would I end our relationship? I said absolutely not. I’m attracted to her as a person, her kindness, her personality, her sense of humor not her physical body, sure it helps that I’m physically attracted to her, but I could imagine my life without her and could not bare to live that way. We would eventually figure everything out as far as everything else goes but I believe while I haven’t had any gay tendencies before that if my wife transitioned to a male, I would remain attracted to him. I think I’m situationally gay. Is this a thing?

First we go happy, then we go rough.  Buckle up.

&nbsp;

Happy version:  Demisexuals are people who are only sexually attracted to people they have feelings for, so there are sexuality that are not contingent on gender.  It's also possible for someone to not initially be attracted to the opposite sex but develop an attraction.  I'm an example of that.  Most LGBTQ folks seem to be born with their attractions but mine is something I established by demolishing all the barriers between me and the same sex via logic.  This tends to be rare, but with an emotional investment in someone transitioning that would make it significantly easier.  Also, butt stuff is fun, even for many straight folks :P.  So you don't have to be gay and there is also the possibility that you can accept and then enjoy it and become gay, albeit this is as mentioned fairly rare.  

&nbsp;

Rough version:  The harsh truth is that a couple will never know until they cross that bridge.  Folks saying I can stay with X person through Y often don't end up being able to follow through when something happens.  And I don't think there is anything wrong with that.  A relationship is supposed to be 2 people who make each other happier and if things change that make that no longer be the case I think it's downright selfish to expect the other person to stay with you even if they become unhappy.

Transitioning is especially rough because it entails physical changes that affect sex and potentially attraction, but it also entails hormonal changes that can affect how someone behaves.  So brass tacks is that it's always going to be a bit of a gamble on whether a relationship would survive the day to day month to month practical realities.",transgender,AskReddit,"Straight People, what do you want to ask about the LGBTQ+ community that you wouldn't ask in real life?",https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cvhgqx/straight_people_what_do_you_want_to_ask_about_the/ey4ptep/

ey4nyae,"I’m cynical and fairly pessimistic about politics but I give Bernie a lot of credit for his political common sense and knack for coming up with winning strategies. I’m not saying he will for sure succeed but I think if anyone is going to get something done, it’s him. And I do think that if elected, he will enact Medicare for All over a 4 year period and I do think he’ll tax carbon emissions and I do think he’ll be less hawkish than any other president in the last couple decades. I don’t see him folding on any of those things. It’s actually delusional to think he’s just going to pull an Obama. Obama raised a billion dollars from corrupt enterprises to get elected. To think the guy who fundamentally differs in his fundraising principles and has a decades long record of consistency will pull a 180 at the end of his life is delusional.",,deepfatfried,Paul Prediction,https://reddit.com/r/deepfatfried/comments/cvdwbq/paul_prediction/ey4nyae/

When it comes to labeling sexuality, it’s usually by whatever gender the person identifies with. So an MTF trans person attracted to only women would identify as lesbian, and an FTM trans person attracted to only men would identify as gay. MTF only attracted to men would likely identify as straight, and FTM attracted to only women would likely identify as straight as well.

ey4r5tx,"I don’t think I’m going out on a limb by saying that air travel can be stressful. Crowded flights rarely bring out the best in people, and that’s why common courtesy is so important. If you’ve ever been on a plane where a parent blatantly disregards that courtesy and lets her little black kid cry his lungs out in the seat next to you, then you’ve probably been pretty aggravated, much as I was on a recent flight to Atlanta. And yet somehow—don’t ask me how—for some reason I’ve come out of this whole episode as the bad guy. Yes, me. You know, as if that makes any sense at all**.**

Why? Oh, because apparently slapping a little nigger baby and telling him to shut up makes you some kind of monster in this day and age. Go figure.

Seriously, though, explain to me how I come out of this one looking like “the villain.” What was I doing wrong? Sitting in my seat, drinking my alcohol, and minding my own business? I acted like a normal human being, and now I’m being vilified. Look, I have all the sympathy in the world for parents traveling with young children. I know it’s no picnic. But if you can’t get your child to behave, then I’m sorry, steps need to be taken. I mean, am I missing something here?

And man, you wouldn’t believe the looks I got after I hit that nigger kid. Seriously, they were looking at me like I just totally lost my shit. Like I’d been the one crying, ruining the flight for everyone! No joke, these people turned on me so quick. On me**! The good guy in this situation! It was one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen in my life: An airplane full of people looked at a screaming colored kid, and then looked at me—the guy who hit the kid, mind you—and they all decide to side with the colored kid. I couldn’t believe my fucking eyes.**

Are you telling me if you were sitting next to this screeching little tar baby, you wouldn’t slap him? Or at least call him a nigger and just tell him to shut up? Well, if you have that kind of restraint, then way to go, Mother Teresa! Good for you. But I think the rest of us mortals would have done exactly the same thing. And again, what exactly was wrong about what I did? That’s right, nothing! I was doing the right thing! I was making the flight better for everyone!

In fact, why am I even explaining myself here? The nigger kid was and is the bad guy! Has everyone gone crazy or something?

And, look, obviously that cunt flight attendant had it out for me from the beginning, so I can see how she might have turned a few of the passengers against me, especially the other niggers. Still, you would think a few of the non-nigger and non-cunt passengers on board would have come to their senses and defended me. Nope. Not one of them did. So now I got this negro kid bawling in one ear, a shrill cunt clucking in the other, and 60 people looking at me like I’m Attila the Hun. I know, right? It makes no sense.

I lost my job over this, you know. I got fired. Until a few days ago, I was president of AGC’s Unitech Composites and Structures unit. Over 20 years of expert stewardship. But, oh, slap a nigger baby and suddenly two decades of loyalty and professionalism go up in smoke. Now I’m collecting welfare like a fucking spic. Can you even begin to wrap your mind around how retarded that is?

The thing that really kills me, though, is how unnecessary all this attention was. This whole thing wouldn’t have gotten so out of hand if the goddamned Jew-controlled media hadn’t slipped it into their 24-hour news cycle, the little faggots. That’s right, the greedy Jewish media vultures just swooped in and made sure that I looked like some kind of monster. Me: a decent, normal guy on his fifth bourbon, trying to enjoy his flight.

Well, now it’s all over and my life is ruined.

ey4rexg,"I can see why you'd think that if you're going off of dated assumptions, but it can't go back in time and make your brain a different gender. I'm a trans woman, my brain is not the same as a cis man's, never has been. Scans would show that in many sexually dimorphic regions my brain is more female than male. It is not possible for LSD to do that. 

Nobody suddenly turns trans, it might *seem* sudden because we have a lot of incentive to hide it. I wanted to be a girl but my religious upbringing told me that was impossible, so it was more important at the time to not be bullied at school or sent to a camp for seeming gay. I went through a rough depressive episode and almost committed suicide and that was my wakeup call, that was my impetus for coming out. For some people a hallucinogenic is responsible, or the loss of a loved one, powerful emotional experiences in general make us come out but they do not turn us trans in the first place.

I also want to clarify dysmorphia is a separate and distinct condition from dysphoria, they do sound pretty similar, but dysphoria happens when we're really, painfully aware of how we actually look. Dysmorphia is a warped perception and cannot be treated by affirmation as dysphoria can be. They can coincide but they're very different experiences with drastically different treatments. Gender transition works and cures the dysphoria, plastic surgery does not help dysmorphia, that needs therapy, which cannot cure or even really treat dysphoria, only the accompanying things like depression. And dysphoria is just a mental state, the opposite of euphoria, it can be caused by a lot of things besides being trans, drugs can often cause it, but they don't specifically cause *gender* dysphoria.",trans woman,AskReddit,What has NOT aged well?,https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cv9stg/what_has_not_aged_well/ey4rexg/

ey42tlp,"Disagree. I got in this conversation the other night, so I want to really lay down the clarity: I support trans people, I love trans people, etc, etc.

Most people who talk about drugs not 'making them things' are generally referring to psilocybin or LSD. The fact is there are some incredibly powerfully hallucinogenics that can create these rifts. For certain people, yes, LSD can *make* you schizophrenic. Yes, there is a correlation to schizophrenia and irresponsible drug use, however, in order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, you need to have at least a full-blown episode. Drugs can definitely trigger these things in people who would not have otherwise had a psychotic break. 

Drugs don't 'make' you anything, LSD isn't more likely to make you trans than ketamine, but I am saying that if you have certain predispositions and you're into intense doses of ketamine and autoerotic asphyxiation, you're going to work up a lot of ego silt that can fundamentally change how you think.",,AskReddit,What has NOT aged well?,https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cv9stg/what_has_not_aged_well/ey42tlp/

ey4rzff,"Firstly, regrading research on the topic, I clearly asked for any surveys done on it. Another commenter linked one which did support what I was saying. Take a look at the 'miniscule chance' yourself.

As for abuse in foster homes, that's a point I hadn't considered before. Although I doubt there are sufficient statistics to back up your claim, specifically, abuse by LGBTQ adoptive parents. If there is, and you can reference them along with statistics regarding abuse in foster care then I am open to changing my mind.

Regarding me stating that there are people who say that being LGBTQ is special, that's not something which I read on a conservative news site, it's what I observe in the world around me. E.g. my school offers a scholarship for LGBTQ people. If they aren't being told that they're special then why do they need their own scholarship?

And as for me saying I'm not homophobic, I stand by my statement. If you came up to me and said you were gay I would not give a shit. My concern lies with the way the world is being pushed into this extremely liberal stance, especially with the LGBTQ community. More and more people are 'becoming' LGBTQ (https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx) although it is difficult if not impossible to definitely state this due to other factors such as stigma. Nevertheless, I disagree with a lot of the things which are currently happening due to far-left politics. If you want to call me something, then call transphobic, because I am. Literally changing your sex is 100% unnatural. And don't start with the 'they're trapped in the wrong body' shit. They're obviously not since they were born in that body. They may identify themself as the other gender, but that doesn't mean that they ARE the other gender.",transphobic,rareinsults,The apple doesn't fall far from the stump,https://reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/cvcn6d/the_apple_doesnt_fall_far_from_the_stump/ey4rzff/
ey4ptof,"So you would prefer that children stay in the out of home care or foster system, where they have a ludicrously higher chance of being victim to abuse and neglect, than let them be adopted by a gay couple because there *may* be a chance, even if it's a minuscule chance, that those children could be 'converted' to becoming gay? Wow...


You phrased your opinion politely enough, but I still think you're a piece of shit. You have that opinion despite not knowing whether there is research on the topic? If there was a vote to allow gay adoptions tomorrow, you would vote 'no' because of your concern, despite having clearly done no research on the matter?


Why don't you prioritise the welfare of children over your homophobia (you say you're not homophobic, but c'mon bruh, you clearly are in some way if your opinion on the topic is based on your fears that slightly more people will be gay than they are now)? Children would much prefer to live with the best carers for them, than to stay in the OOHC system. Trust me, I've worked with those kids for close to ten years now.


Also, you say 'if everyone and everything is telling you that being gay isn't just OK, that it's actually a good thing that you're special...' only fringe groups would say that being gay is special and better than being straight. Where the fuck did you ever get that idea? I will make a dumb fuck assumption and say that you read that shit on some conservative news site that was probably quoting a far-left media outlet as though it was what 'all libs want'.",,rareinsults,The apple doesn't fall far from the stump,https://reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/cvcn6d/the_apple_doesnt_fall_far_from_the_stump/ey4ptof/
ey4egji,"I have a bit of a controversial opinion regarding this, at least for Reddit.  My only concern with all of the LGBTQ stuff is that it will cause more of it to happen, more people to be LGBTQ even though they're not really. I.e. they get confused. If everything and everyone is telling you that being gay isn't just ok, that it's actually a good thing and that you're special then obviously more people will think that they're LGBTQ.

There is no doubt that the default biological genders are male and female. Don't get started with that being gay is genetic, or that it's hardwired in your brain, it may very well be. But that doesn't change the fact that 99.999% (random guess but you know what I mean) of relationships are male/female. 

What I want to see is a study of the sexual orientations of the (adopted) children of LGBTQ couples and compare that to the sexual orientations (edit: of the children of) straight couples. If the rate is the same or similar, then I fully support LGBTQ couples being allowed to adopt. Obviously when your parents, the two people who are most responsible for shaping who you are, are gay then that's going to rub off on you to some degree. 

Again, I have no problem with LGBTQ people, I am just attempting to respectfully convey my opinion and become more educated on this topic by starting a civilised discussion. If you disagree with what I say, comment and say why rather than just downvoting me because that won't change my opinion.",,rareinsults,The apple doesn't fall far from the stump,https://reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/cvcn6d/the_apple_doesnt_fall_far_from_the_stump/ey4egji/

Maybe find some data that actually supports your viewpoint? 

I’ve showed you the analysis which you stupidly denied and now I’ve showed you that you’re missing some human rights. You got anything else? 

“The individuals most likely to suffer abuse in the United States—including members of racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, children, the poor, and prisoners—are often least able to defend their rights in court or via the political process. Many vulnerable groups endured renewed attacks on their rights during the year. Other longstanding US laws and practices—particularly related to criminal and juvenile justice, immigration, and national security—continued to violate internationally recognized human rights.”

-Vulnerable groups have human rights violated in the US. The rule of law ( a right) is often violated.

“A 2017 Human Rights Watch report demonstrated that pretrial detention—often resulting from failure to pay bail—coerces people, some innocent, into pleading guilty just to get out of jail.”

-Again with some shady shit with the rule of law

“Around 1.5 million Americans live in nursing homes, where inappropriate and nonconsensual use of antipsychotic medications—for staff convenience or to discipline residents without a medical purpose—is widespread. To date, government agencies have not taken sufficient steps to end this practice.”

-Staff drugging people without consent seems like a breech of human rights to me

“The Trump administration’s proposed cuts to the ACA, which provides crucial services to people with disabilities, and a proposed rollback of accessibility obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, could undermine the rights of people with disabilities.”

“President Trump, his cabinet appointees, and the Republican-controlled Congress rolled back some important women’s rights protections, domestically and in foreign policy, and pledged to dismantle others.”

“significant assaults on women’s human rights,”

“In the first five months of 2017, legislators in several states introduced more than 100 bills that would attack or undermine LGBT rights.”

“Throughout 2017, the US continued to carry out large-scale warrantless intelligence surveillance programs without transparency or oversight.”

Looks like you’re lacking a hell of a lot rights and that even the ones you have are being violated:

I see you had a separate conversation and they summed it up well. 

Good dating sites are actually quite inclusive now of all(most) genders, titles, labels, etc. 

If someone is a trans woman, they should list themselves as such. And if I adjust my preferences to view only cis-women for example, I shouldn’t see trans individuals there. And following your other convo is why I expect that and my reasons for it.

Honesty and safety. 
I expect and actually give full honesty and disclosure in my dating profiles as an actively dating, polyamorous person for example.

If someone can not be honest with me up front about their incompatibility with me, it’ll just lead to a very awkward encounter down the road. 

While on the flip side, I do not- and never have condoned or wish assault of trans women for them listing that they are. I believe it’s a total travesty that individuals would go out of their way to commit such heinous acts And why I believe everyone should be more careful and practice safer dating habits no matter who you are.

For their safety(everyone’s safety really), I find labels extremely important. 

I do not go around assuming trans women labeling themselves as women(on applicable sites) are there to catfish people. I honestly don’t. However you can not not expect a few to go “wtf?” when they have their personal preferences showing different catches than they expect. That isn’t our fault.

Now if this were someone who had purposefully continued to misgender said enby, then yeah I could see this as an appropriate response. But since this is the case of two characters meeting for the first time, I think it's much more believable for the enby to 

1. mention their preferred pronouns when first introduced, or 

2. have a one on one conversation with the new acquaintance afterwards or, as I now see your point, 

3. Interject in a non-aggressive manner. For example, ""hey, sorry but please refer to me with they/them pronouns. Thanks"" not just a rude ""They.""

A trans only has the labbel of the opposite sex behind all the makeup and hairs the original sex is very well defined, the face structure, bone structure, genitalia, internal organs, genetic makeup, psychological aspects.

I myself feel a sense of shame and grossness about it which I am trying to work through, but on the real, a lot of men ARE gross and  dangerous. It does not help that many men (yourself included) seem to take their anger out exclusively on women while simultaneously centering their woes in life about the lack of attention women give them.  

I used to spend time running that Redpill and incel memegame to try and separate myself from women and femininity as much as possible, like some anti-gay priest who later comes out. During that time, I don't think I saw a single thing that improved my mental condition and made me a better person.  

Embodying the positive aspects of masculinity won't make you a beta cuck. Having no friends, and being treated like a dangerous creep, is not inherent to the male experience. I guarantee there are men far more hideous and scary looking than you that have healthy relationships with women due to their mindset (this is true, people in incel communities don't like to admit it because they can no longer blame anyone but themselves for their problems)

No, you're intentionally not understanding at this point. Finding out someone is trans after you're interested in them and still liking them is much different than seeking someone out *because* they're trans. Very different. One's okay, the other isn't.

And as for your example, let me explain why that's not the same thing; being Asian, much like being trans, is an immutable fact about someone. Them exercising? That can come and go. I was super into physical fitness when I was talking to a guy who was a fitness trainer. But that can change. You can tell anyone, ""Hey, we should workout together!"" But trolling for fitness booty is kind of gross, but trolling for Asian women specifically because you're into Asians or trolling for trans women specifically because you're into trans people is gross, and reduces the people to objects.

ey4vdju,"Gender is what's in your head and how you perceive yourself. Sex is biological. If this seems confusing, it sometimes is! But keep in mind, the gender binary itself is invented, and a staggering amount of non-European cultures recognize more than two genders as ""naturally"" as we recognize men and women now. 

As for your question: There are men who do everything you describe and still ID as men. There are also trans women who don't wear skirts or act feminine (just like cis women who don't wear skirts or act feminine). 

You're right to note that someone's presentation isn't equal to their identity, but identity itself isn't biological. Rather, it's a complex mix of cultural, social, psychological, environmental, etc. factors -- it's about who YOU are to yourself. Think about yourself, for a moment. Without talking about your genitals, how do you know you're a man/woman? If I took away those things through horrible space magic, or a car accident, or a surgery, you wouldn't stop being that, right? 

As for the chromosome argument: sex is actually way more complicated than we initially thought.  The binary is largely an invention that came after the identification of the Y chromosome, which gained widespread popularity in textbooks but ignored a host of other developmental factors. It gained so much popularity that it changed the way we did research, but it turns out... we didn't know what the fuck was really going on. 

 This isn't to say eggs and sperm and gonads and uteruses and so on don't exist, but the two sexes are better defined as two broad statistical peaks rather than just one or the other. Intersex people are more common than redheads, for one, and that doesn't even include the wide range of possible combinations of chromosomes an individual might have.  Recent research also indicates biological differences in the brains of  pre-op trans people. 

Also, if you DO take hormones -- you're developing the physical characteristics associated with those hormones! It's comparable to going through puberty all over again. So, you know, trans women (for example) really are developing the physical characteristics of cis women. Basically, if gender is ""in your genes"", but all the chemicals controlling gene expression change... how reliable is that as a metric anyway?

I went for a nap and my computer was fine. I had no inclination that there was an update coming or anything of that nature.

When I woke up from my nap I noticed my lockscreen was changed to a default pic. I log in and everything on my desktop is gone. Tons or shortcuts, software, games, file directories. Look in c: and all of my files are gone, pics, extensive pdf book collection, my music, my other documents. The toolbar back to normal, my pinned programs gone, my preferred browser gone.

I currently have a restore point working but does anyone have an idea of what happened? And if this restore point doesn't work what can I do? I have a hard time believing windows can just wipe 2 years worth of files for no reason this is rather upsetting.

## Posts Should Be High Effort (Low-Quality content)

Low-effort or low-quality posts hinder meaningful discussion from flourishing and will be removed at the moderators' discretion. All posts should offer some basis for discussion. Please note that spending a lot of time on a ""low effort"" post does not exclude it from this rule.Type of low-quality content we do not allow:

- Gameplay videos or screenshots that are taken on a phone are not allowed, unless they are clear and stable and follow other rules.
- No pixelated or low-resolution content.
- No match result or ""first win"" type screenshots.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Posting videos or pictures of a suspected cheater.

ey4w3b2,"Oh, wow. I see you're being hit with it a bit on this thread too.

I hear you on the misandry thing. It really is ignored in leftie spaces, and transgender spaces are unfortunately leftie spaces (and I say that as a socialist who just thinks that identities shouldn't be politicised/polarised if it can be avoided, because it makes a demographic into a political football).

I was heavily into the MRM in the early days when it wasn't politicised. I was one who from the beginning said it was likely to be captured by the hateful, reactionary right (in reaction to the left identification of feminism), and thus it must stay neutral or even be openly progressive (so that it could stand shoulder to shoulder with feminism as an alternative view within the left), otherwise a polarisation would inevitably occur.

I was asked to write for A Voice for Men, but got nervous of being a public figure since I'm stealth. I dropped my YouTube ambitions similarly.

These days, I observe with dismay how damn toxic the ""manosphere"" has become, with incels and suchlike. Yes, I know that technically anyone's an incel if they can't get a date, but there's a dodgy subculture that has arisen. Of course a tiny number have become shooters, but that's a low bar.

If I raised my public visibility again, I'd be equally critical of those describing themselves as ""MRAs"" and ""feminists"" because I think that both mobs do a pretty shitty job of being fair gender-egalitarian activists.

Anyway, this isn't all about me. ;)

I totally get that annoyance at seeing men's issues being dismissed. I felt it before transition, and I continued to feel it upon noting how much better I was treated as a woman, in so many ways.

Don't get too one-eyed though, as we say in Australia. It really isn't the case that there's one ""truly oppressed gender"". Your male identity makes you feel one side of it, but I'm pretty sure you are well aware of all sorts of shit that girls have to put up with, from before your transition.

Like I said before, there are plenty of legit and rational qualities that can impede potential attraction to a trans person, and that's all cool

It does become transphobic, however, when the only reason you reject someone is on account of the ""trans"" label, or on the basis of chromosomes you'll never interact with

If infertility is a deal breaker, fine, that's not exclusive to trans people. If failing to meet genital requirements is a deal breaker, fine, that's not exclusive to trans people. If a lack of attraction is a deal breaker, fine, that's not exclusive to trans people

However, if you specify someone being trans as the deal breaker rather than any issue actually pertinent to the relationship, I think that's a clear display of an irrational prejudice or dislike for trans people",transphobic,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey3jwzw/

""It"" was in reference to the idea that I support, and my unwillingness to date that idea. I just knew you'd home in on that low-hanging fruit, despite basic reading comprehension being enough to determine that the subject was ambiguous.


>That you view being a transperson as comparable to being a person with severe mental illness


Again, you've misread me. I'm not saying trans people are the same as people with severe mental illness. I've said that my reasons for not dating them are comparable to those of someone who wouldn't want to date someone with a mental illness. It's not their fault they have a mental illness, and that's just a part of them that could get easier to deal with after some treatment, but not everyone is willing to ride that rollercoaster. That's the comparison I'm drawing. 



>that you view friendship as a magnanimous concession but a relationship as an unrealistic ask as it requires you to ignore that they're 'biologically male'


Friendships and relationships are different things. My circle of friends are determined by whom I like to be around. My relationships are determined by that *and* whom I am attracted to. I could find you physically unattractive, your religion to be a roadblock, your personality to be incompatible with mine...and yes, your biology can factor into that. I'm not comfortable with the existence or the implication of a penis on a girl. That will never appeal to me. I don't like the idea of dealing with dysmorphia, which is why I tend to stay away from anorexia and bulimia. It's simply unattractive to me. 

Listen man. I don't want to dip my toes in the transgender world. I simply do not want to get involved. It's not attractive to me.

I'm personally not attracted to any trans people for similar reasons that someone wouldn't be attracted to someone with Psychosis. Or more realistically, someone with depression. When I think of a trans woman, I have no choice but to recognize them as someone who is different from a typical woman. They *are* different. That's why there's the ""trans"" modifier in there. They have baggage. They have a lot of stress, anxiety, emotional issues, etc. surrounding their gender identity. I don't want to take any of that on.

The Husky Howards play with Spiderman toys, but act tough for youtube (Angryman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GRtyijdlGc ). Talking about ""masculinity' and never showed it in real life. I mean, dude wife'd up a chick with two bastard kids, then gave her 3 more. Never played sports, is a short fat dude, playing tough, playing with ""marvel toys"" and such, and think because he's 'black and from the hood' he's tough, but when called out, nothing.

Whining, begging for dono's etc.. And he's not the only one. There all built like him, with the same story, and I don't get why they're shocked, what you think the guys playing football, were doing it for 'glory'? 

Listen 85% of the team, plays for pussy. The other 15% plays either because they love the game, or their dad is forcing them. This is facts.

All you do, in football, is learn how to get girls, f*ck girls, and talk to girls, that's all we do. Plus the girls come, since everyone in the town, loves the football team. It's not rocket science. Hence why the 'fat boys' that play football, end up being the 'cool fat dudes' that can snag a hot girl. Think the show ""King of Queens"" with Kevin James and Leah Remini, the entire trope of his character, is the ""Fat cool football player"" that snagged the hot wife. It's a T.V. Trope for crying out loud.

So I don't get how guys in this, didn't know this unless they never got any girls, ever, and the first thing they touched at age 25 they married, had kids fast, and then had buyers remorse. That's my point.

I don't feel bad for them, but I'm just shocked, they didn't notice the rules in like 8th grade. I saw them, I adjusted, and I'm still smart, went to college, blah blah blah, but was a ""Chad"" all through it, and I was a loser kid in 7th grade. So if I could do it, or see it, how come y'all couldnt'? 

In my area, if you want the hot girls, you gotta play sports. If not, be a tough guy, fighter, or druggy, or just be rich. In college, same thing, but it was more about who is making money, or getting into professional school (Lawyer, doctor, engineer, coding apps etc..)

So, how did people not know this? Unless they got sprung on the first and only pussy they touched, as mama's boys, and then are bitter, since their 'mom's fables' were bullshit.

Als ik nog even mag aanhaken: waarom maakt het voor u uit of het merendeel van het brein werkt als het geslacht waarmee deze mensen zich identificeren? Wat ik tot nu toe zie is dat deze mensen niet gelukkig kunnen zijn met het gender dat zij toegewezen krijgen op basis van hun sekse. Er bestaat geen methode om deze mensen naar hun idee wel het gender te laten zijn dat overeenkomt met hun sekse.

We zien nu een verhoogd aantal zelfmoorden bij transgender mensen. Als je verder kijkt, zie je dat de zelfmoordcijfers van transgenders die alleen al door hun eigen gezin (dus nog niet eens door de samenleving) worden geaccepteerd, weer een enorm stuk lager zijn. Voor mij tekent dit het beeld van een acceptatieprobleem, niet een transgenderprobleem.

Uiteindelijk hoeven wij het niet helemaal te snappen hoe het voelt om zelf transgender te zijn. Voor mij zijn de belangrijkste feiten al beschikbaar: deze mensen kunnen niet gelukkig zijn als zij worden gedwongen te identificeren met een gender dat zij niet zijn. Zij kunnen wel gelukkig zijn als zij worden toegestaan hun eigen identiteit te bepalen en als wij hen ook op die manier accepteren.

Om die reden maakt het mij dus niet uit of het brein werkt zoals het gewenste geslacht, of dat deze mensen er ook wel uit zien als het gewenste geslacht, etc. Dat soort beproevingen van de identiteit van een groep mensen die van nature fragiel is, lijkt mij schadelijk.",transgender,ik_ihe,ik_ihe,https://reddit.com/r/ik_ihe/comments/cv73fg/ik_ihe/ey4wib7/

ey3wwia,"Tuurlijk, aangezien het relatief nieuwe wetenschap is neemt niet weg dat het controversieel is of dat het laatste woord over gezegd is, dat is het nog lang niet. Het is een valse vergelijking, maar die gebruikte ik meer om het gebruik van de term 'waanidee' te relativeren aangezien ik het al een vrij sterk oordeel vind. Toegegeven, ik studeer geen psychologie en wat Contrapoints betreft ben ik persoonlijk veel meer geïnteresseerd in de anti-kapitalistische/politieke content dan degene die aansluit op genderdiscussies. Maar ik zie dat 'waanideeën/mentale stoornis' argument maar al te vaak voorkomen bij mensen die vaak niet eens open lijken te staan voor een discussie over simpel en binair lijkende concepten als sekse en gender (niet dat jij dit per definitie bent, aangezien we hier nu over discussiëren natuurlijk.) Het is natuurlijk onmogelijk om in iemand anders zijn of haar hoofd te kruipen en zelf te oordelen of die dysforie 'klopt' of niet, en is er dan een mogelijkheid dat iemands dysforie geen waanidee is? Ik heb het antwoord niet, maar dit soort vragen doen mij denken dat het simpelweg niet de juiste terminologie is om het er over te hebben, noch is 'kloppen' dat. Wat wel zo is, is dat transgender mensen na transitie vaak aanzienlijk gelukkiger zijn, en het klinkt misschien snowflake-achtig, maar wijsmaken dat transgenders inherent ziek zijn draagt alleen maar bij aan een stigma dat ze nog ongelukkiger maakt, en werkt zo als een vicieuze cirkel. En zodra een redditor inderdaad al eerder opmerkte, zijn trangender hersenen meer als de hersenen van hun verlangde gender, dan hun sekse.  [https://www.ese-hormones.org/media/1506/transgender-brains-are-more-like-their-desired-gender-from-an-early-age.pdf](https://www.ese-hormones.org/media/1506/transgender-brains-are-more-like-their-desired-gender-from-an-early-age.pdf)

Wat kinderen betreft is het mijnsziens lastig. Enerzijds zou je kunnen beargumenteren dat kinderen als het ware als een soort leeg papier functioneren, dat ingevuld wordt door sociale conditionering naarmate ze opgroeien en als het ware minder 'bias' hebben, maar dan geraak je al gauw natuurlijk in het nature vs. nurture debat uiteindelijk waar ik allerminst een expert in ben. Anderzijds zijn kinderhersenen kinderhersenen en kunnen ze zelf veel minder de gevolgen van hun acties overzien, die zich natuurlijk ook weer uitspelen in een bepaalde sociale omgeving. Dus dan komt eigenlijk algauw een dilemma op: als je kind duidelijke tekenen vertoont van gender dysforie, is het dan een 'waanidee' of 'klopt' het wel (zoals je ziet raakt het dilemma over terminologie nu ook weer betrokken)? Misschien is een betere vraag nog, *wanneer* beschouw je een kind 'volwassen' genoeg om aan te nemen dat zijn of haar genderdysforie niet zomaar een fase is en dat een kind er zelf een goed oordeel over kan vellen. Maar waar je die grens trekt is heel erg vaag, een jongen wordt van de ene op de andere dag niet ineens beschouwd als een man (tenzij je Joods bent en een bar mitzvah viert maar je snapt m'n punt denk ik wel.) Maar zodra de puberteit aankomt en plaats vindt, zou je dat natuurlijk als een soort biologisch oordeel kunnen vellen of iemand een transitie waardig is, als de dysforie na de puberteit blijvend is. Maar voor een kind dat bijvoorbeeld van kleins af aan er van overtuigd is dat hij van het andere sekse wil zijn, wordt hij/zij  als het ware 'gedwongen' om iets te worden dat het totaal niet wil, en kan het als een enorme last of misschien zelfs traumatisch ervaren. En dat maakt het dilemma rondom de vraag ""wanneer is een kind zelf vaardig genoeg om over dysforie te oordelen"" alleen maar lastiger. Hoe kan je dat als buitenstaander voor iemand beoordelen terwijl je het zelf totaal niet ervaart? Ik probeer het echt niet per se goed te praten dat kinderen van vroeg af aan al hormoonremmers toegediend kunnen krijgen (zover ik in Nederland weet is dat überhaupt helemaal niet mogelijk en zijn er strikte criteria om in transitie te gaan) maar zoals je zelf al aangeeft, is het gewoon een enorm ingewikkeld onderwerp en een term als 'waanidee' is dan nogal fel. Ik heb zelf een vriendin die tamelijk laat pas als transgender uit de kast kwam (17) en nooit heb ik het idee gehad dat in de 2 jaar dat ik haar als biologische jongen kende, aan waanideeën leed, of structureel de wereld om haar heen verkeerd leek in te schatten alsof ze een mentale stoornis had. Ze was alleen een beetje erg introvert. (het is natuurlijk puur anecdotisch, maar het is maar even voor het perspectief)

De WHO heeft inmiddels al aangegeven het niet meer als een mentale stoornis te beschouwen (vergeet  niet dat mentale gezondheid historisch gezien sowieso ongelooflijk taboe was tot aan \~de afgelopen 50-100 jaar, normaal werd je gelijk zonder pardon opgesloten om in een gesticht om weg te rotten.) en je kan dan natuurlijk afvragen of ze geen agenda hebben, maar zo kan je eindeloos je twijfels over gezaghebbende bronnen doortrekken. Zo dwing je uiteindelijk mensen een *negatief* iets te bewijzen, namelijk dat de WHO *geen* agenda heeft, en dat lijkt me ook een drogreden. Zover ik bekend ben zijn er ook helemaal geen kinderen bij ouders weggehaald om ""intolerantie"".

ey3ria2,"De reden dat ik identiteit gebruikte was omdat het vaker in de media wordt gebruikt dan sekse als er over dit onderwerp wordt gesproken. Laat ik het ook duidelijk maken dat ik het heb over het biologische geslacht. De analogie met Darwin's evolutietheorie is natuurlijk heel mooi, maar  dit is een valse vergelijking en het is een drogenreden die ik, jammer genoeg, te vaak hoor om controversiële theorieën te rechtvaardigen. En nee, ik denk ook niet het zo simpel is als een man die een jurk heeft aangedaan en daarmee zich als vrouw voordoet, ik snap goed dat het voor zo'n individu veel ingewikkelder ligt dan dat, en ik hoop dat we ooit op een dag een daadwerkelijk goede oplossing voor verzinnen. 

Voor mij komt het vooral op neer dat ik niet geloof dat we op de lange termijn deze mensen gaan helpen door hun waanbeelden te bevestigen, daar hebben we nog veel te weinig data over. ik bedoel het ook helemaal niet uit kwade wil, het tegendeel zelfs, ik wil dat deze mensen uiteindelijk geholpen worden. Wat ik ook een kwalijke zaak vind is hoe het onderwerp steeds vaker op jonge leeftijd wordt behandeld, en hoe sommige ouders hun kinderen moeten opgeven vanwege hun ""intolerantie"".",,ik_ihe,ik_ihe,https://reddit.com/r/ik_ihe/comments/cv73fg/ik_ihe/ey3ria2/
ey3pwha,"Natalie is niet zomaar een 'gozer die een jurk aantrekt' maar iemand die actief in transitie gegaan is. Je kan prima vinden dat het vreemd is dat je zelf ""je 'identiteit' kan bepalen', en het is allemaal leuk dat je 'identiteit' als eufemisme gebruikt voor sekse, want dan kan je je tenminste verschuilen achter een parapluterm die tal van dingen kan bedoelen. Ik heb er niet voor gekozen dat ik op een bepaald territorium ben geworden waardoor ik officieel Nederlander ben, maar wat houdt Nederlander zijn precies in, wie heeft het recht om voor mij te bepalen wat ik moet voelen bij Nederlander zijn? Hoe zit het met de kinderen van autochtone Nederlanders die bijvoorbeeld in het buitenland geboren worden en opgroeien, ervaren die hetzelfde bij het begrip 'Nederlander' als ik? Identiteit is niet zwart-wit.  


Ik heb zelf ook allerlei vragen over gender dysforie en beschouw mezelf allerminst als een trans-expert. Ik mag toch hopen dat het verschil tussen gender en sekse wel duidelijk is. Maar als de sociale kenmerken die we toeschrijven een het gender van jongen en meisje, kan dan niet de context waarin iemand met gender dysforie verschillen afhankelijk van de cultuur, ook al is de biologische sekse natuurlijk wel vrijwel overal hetzelfde? Maar uiteindelijk, als iemand bedenkingen heeft of hij zich daadwerkelijk een jongen of meisje voelt, kan je diegene niet zomaar forceren zich zomaar een jongen of een meisje te voelen in zijn of haar hoofd toch?  Tuurlijk, je kan aan uiterlijke kenmerken met 95% zekerheid iemands biologische sekse wel raden, maar wie ben ik om te zeggen of diegene er zich zo ook bij *voelt, of moet voelen*? En als iemand zo zeker van  zijn of haar dysforie overtuigd is, wie ben ik dan het diegene allemaal te ontzeggen als we de medische mogelijkheden hebben om die mensen in transitie te laten gaan?   


Identiteit in allerlei mogelijke facetten is ontzettend ingewikkeld. Waar zit het hem precies in tussen een biologisch meisje/vrouw die een jongen/man wil worden en dysforie heeft, en een biologisch meisje die zich meer als een jongen kleedt en gedraagt, maar zich desalniettemin toch echt een meisje voelt en geen dysforie heeft? Ik weet het niet precies, maar het maakt makkelijke antwoorden niet waarschijnlijker.  Wat chromosomen betreft bestaat zoiets als intersekse ook, en is biologische sekse strikt gezien niet eens binair, ook al zou het maar 0.00001% van de bevolking zijn, het is er nog steeds. Binaire gender is ook iets wat je zeker in de wereldwijd dominante Abrahmitische religies ziet, maar er bestaan/hebben ook culturen met niet binaire genders bestaan.

Je bent echt geen inherent slecht mens, dat kan op basis van een paar korte comments op een forum simpelweg niet zomaar beoordeeld worden. Het zijn allemaal relatief nieuwe ontwikkelingen in wetenschappelijk onderzoek, maar de wetenschap evolueert mettertijd. Toen Darwin met zijn evolutietheorie kwam was het ook onmogelijk ons voor te stellen dat wij en allerlei apensoorten gemeenschappelijke voorouders hebben, aangezien de directe verschillen tussen mensen en apen zo overduidelijk zijn. Het komt alleen een beetje bekrompen over in de context van een vrouw waarvan het echt vrij duidelijk is dat ze niet als man voor de lol zomaar een jurk aantrok, maar actief in transitie zit of mogelijk zelfs al klaar is (ik weet de details van Natalie's persoonlijk leven niet.

Why do you keep talking like I'm trying to pressure you into a sexual relationship? Like I'm a pimp for trans people?

This is spectacularly dishonest and there's no way you don't know it. If you are heterosexual man, you are attracted to female sexual characteristics. That isn't complicated. Which is why, if a transwoman hasn't transitioned yet many--not all-- heterosexual men will not be attracted. That is perfectly fair and reasonable. However, this conversation is about the idea that *any and all* transwoman are unattractive to you and that includes the unclockable and fully transitioned. There is no such thing as 'the implication of a penis'. There is either a penis or there isn't. You aren't avoiding a penis. You are avoiding an imagined masculine essence.

""It"" was in reference to the idea that I support, and my unwillingness to date that idea. I just knew you'd home in on that low-hanging fruit, despite basic reading comprehension being enough to determine that the subject was ambiguous.


>That you view being a transperson as comparable to being a person with severe mental illness


Again, you've misread me. I'm not saying trans people are the same as people with severe mental illness. I've said that my reasons for not dating them are comparable to those of someone who wouldn't want to date someone with a mental illness. It's not their fault they have a mental illness, and that's just a part of them that could get easier to deal with after some treatment, but not everyone is willing to ride that rollercoaster. That's the comparison I'm drawing. 



>that you view friendship as a magnanimous concession but a relationship as an unrealistic ask as it requires you to ignore that they're 'biologically male'


Friendships and relationships are different things. My circle of friends is determined by whom I like to be around. My relationships are determined by that *and* whom I am attracted to. I could find you physically unattractive, your religion to be a roadblock, your personality to be incompatible with mine...and yes, your biology can factor into that.

ey4es72,"Hold up. Not being attracted to someone who is trans just *has* to be transphobia? Shit, I'm not attracted to Eskimos. Am I racist now? 

I'm personally not attracted to any trans people for similar reasons that someone wouldn't be attracted to someone with Psychosis. Or more realistically, someone with depression. When I think of a trans woman, I have no choice but to recognize them as someone who is different from a typical woman. They *are* different. That's why there's the ""trans"" modifier in there. They have baggage. They have a lot of stress, anxiety, emotional issues, etc. surrounding their gender identity. I don't want to take any of that on. And even though this might be hard to conceive in your scope, overcoming the idea that someone is biologically male is not something that everyone can just do. It's not transphobia. It's just discomfort. I am not comfortable with the idea that this person was once a ""man"" for all intents and purposes. I understand that they see themselves as a woman, and I support it, but I couldn't date it. That's just not a category of person that I find attractive, and it's bonkers to me that'd you'd make someone feel guilty because of that. 

Dating is 100% up to the preferences of the person looking to date someone. You have no jurisdiction over whom I find attractive or unattractive. I like short, pretty, outgoing, funny, intelligent, casual girls. I prefer that they're not hot-headed or too needy. Trans and bi doesn't sit right with me, and mental illness/disease is one hell of a commitment to make. So am I tall-phobic? Shy-phobic? Dumb-phobic? Do I have a phobia of every group of people I'm not attracted to? I don't hate those girls. I'd be friends with them for sure. I'm friends with all types. I just don't want to date them, and I'm sure they wouldn't wanna date me.

No one said otherwise and framing it this way is spectacularly dishonest.

Asking people to be critical of a prejudice is not asking them to submit to fuckin' rape. If you are attracted to women but not attracted to transwomen, as a whole, the only explanation would be that you do not view transwomen as women. We are not demanding that you have sex with anyone. We are asking that you examine why transgenderism is a reason to not be attracted to someone as a way of understanding and challenging the transphobia that is preventing attraction.

A number of things from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/bvimfy/extremely_confused/eqeiqno/) post might help you too. There are explaining resources there and hints concerning looking for support, there is a vid in the resources with unobtrusive things that could be done regularly for motivation, there are hints there concerning presentation, starting with neutral styles first, and there are also hints there concerning looking for a gender therapist.

[PFLAG](https://pflag.org/needsupport) for example might provide support and they may also help explain to parents.

And some people ask for a therapist for reasons concerning emotions ( which is true), and look for someone who has, amongst others, gender on their list. They may help explain later.


And for the moment taking deep and slow breaths and trying to concentrate on the surrounding could help.

And if you feel really low please reach out .. there are helplines, for example 

translifeline.org  Its trans people there, it may be necessary to call a few times until someone answers.

thetrevorproject.org/get-help-now/ This one is for people under 25 and they also have a chat.

And Cypro can make for depressions and it can deplete B12, which can also make for depressions so a number of people use a B12 supplement. And a number use it in low doses of 6-25 mg. Some use a quarter every other day.

An option may be Bicalutamide. Some people also successfully use it in low doses of 12-25 mg. Cypro can make for raised levels of prolactin and can cause prolactinoma eventually.

In general having vital functions monitored may be a good idea.

Concerning HRT looking for informed consent places may be a good idea, and a number of things from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ukyul/is_it_normal_to_be_on_the_same_hrt_dose_for_6_to/e9mv188/) and from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fefu33e8O-0&feature=youtu.be

On the event that Powers refused to give Walter Miller a letter in support of his gender transition and in particular genital surgery, Miller took out his handgun and shot Powers a total of 17 times, killing the psychiatrist instantly, then killed himself.

Wales is quite small so going to pick specific locations otherwise I’ll end up covering the whole country.  In no particular order:

Cardiff - Museum of Welsh Life near Cardiff has many awards as one of the best museums and I can’t recommend it enough. Cardiff castle really cool, and all the other attractions a major city offers.

Mount Snowdon - Tallest mountain in England and Wales, fun to climb, can take a train up it if unable to or want the novelty of it. Other cool little villages around, Beddgelert for one has a cool story to read.

Portmeirion - Interesting Italian inspired village, wouldn’t look out of place on the Amalfi coast.

Rhossili beach - Wales has hundreds of top beaches for a variety of activities. Chose this one as it regularly wins best in the UK and is just brilliant on a summers day, or for a brisk more wintery walk.

Anglesey - A small island to explore. Lots of beaches, historic towns (Beaumaris), the Menai bridge, LlanfairPG.

Pen-y-fan - I don’t think I could’ve got away without putting 2 mountains on this list. An easier climb (for some routes) than Snowdon. Set in the picturesque Brecon Beacons. Lovely rural area, not far from big towns.

St David’s - The UKs smallest city. A population under 2,000 yet has been granted city status on account of its brilliant cathedral. Located in Pembrokeshire with easy access to lots of beautiful beaches and villages, recommend the nearby Solfa.

Conwy - A north Welsh town with an impressive castle and a rich tapestry of history. Hard to pick a castle town as Wales has a number of impressive castles all over.

Tenby/Saundersfoot - Two lovely little towns right on the coast. Colourful houses, good pubs. Great for a relaxing break near the sea.

Anywhere! - Cliché I know but in Wales chances are you are under 15 minutes away from a beach, mountain, castle, or museum. There’s countless things to do, from rock climbing, white water rafting, surfing to more relaxing activities like a hill walk, exploring a ruined castle, or just eating at a number of top restaurants.

And from the sounds of things, this fact alone is unattractive to whoever may be trans, so like...who exactly is missing out on anything here? A trans girl doesn't have to date a bigot, and I get to go on my merry way. What's wrong with this?

Why do you keep talking like I'm trying to pressure you into a sexual relationship? Like I'm a pimp for trans people? I am saying that if you unable to be attracted to a trans or bi person or a particular ethnic minority then it is *very* likely that this barrier is motivated by bigotries, conscious or unconscious, that you should try to examine honestly and critically.

&#x200B;

>I'm not comfortable with the existence or the implication of a penis on a girl.

&#x200B;

This is spectacularly dishonest and there's no way you don't know it. If you are heterosexual man, you are attracted to female sexual characteristics. That isn't complicated. Which is why, if a transwoman hasn't transitioned yet many--not all-- heterosexual men will not be attracted. That is perfectly fair and reasonable. However, this conversation is about the idea that *any and all* transwoman are unattractive to you and that includes the unclockable and fully transitioned. There is no such thing as '**the implication of a penis**'. There is either a penis or there isn't. You aren't avoiding a penis. You are avoiding an imagined masculine essence.

&#x200B;

You think that I'm trying to be morally superior or some bullshit, like I'm trying to say you're a bad person. I don't care who you do or don't fuck. My point was that if *no* *conceivable*  trans person could be attractive to you, that is highly indicative of a prejudice. Now you wanted to challenge that notion but you keep sliding into bullshit like the above that is clearly dancing around. So that's...y'know...indicative.

&#x200B;

I don't like Eskimo faces. That's my reason. That's all. Guess I'm racist now.

>describing trans people as a monolith replete with wonderful terms like 'it'.


""It"" was in reference to the idea that I support, and my unwillingness to date that idea. I just knew you'd home in on that low-hanging fruit, despite basic reading comprehension being enough to determine that the subject was ambiguous.


>That you view being a transperson as comparable to being a person with severe mental illness


Again, you've misread me. I'm not saying trans people are the same as people with severe mental illness. I've said that my reasons for not dating them are comparable to those of someone who wouldn't want to date someone with a mental illness. It's not their fault they have a mental illness, and that's just a part of them that could get easier to deal with after some treatment, but not everyone is willing to ride that rollercoaster. That's the comparison I'm drawing. 



>that you view friendship as a magnanimous concession but a relationship as an unrealistic ask as it requires you to ignore that they're 'biologically male'


Friendships and relationships are different things. My circle of friends is determined by whom I like to be around. My relationships are determined by that *and* whom I am attracted to. I could find you physically unattractive, your religion to be a roadblock, your personality to be incompatible with mine...and yes, your biology can factor into that. I'm not comfortable with the existence or the implication of a penis on a girl. That will never appeal to me. I don't like the idea of dealing with dysmorphia, which is why I tend to stay away from anorexia and bulimia. It's simply unattractive to me.

This isn't performative. It's not a moral thing.

ey4es72,"Hold up. Not being attracted to someone who is trans just *has* to be transphobia? Shit, I'm not attracted to Eskimos. Am I racist now? 

I'm personally not attracted to any trans people for similar reasons that someone wouldn't be attracted to someone with Psychosis. Or more realistically, someone with depression. When I think of a trans woman, I have no choice but to recognize them as someone who is different from a typical woman. They *are* different. That's why there's the ""trans"" modifier in there. They have baggage. They have a lot of stress, anxiety, emotional issues, etc. surrounding their gender identity. I don't want to take any of that on. And even though this might be hard to conceive in your scope, overcoming the idea that someone is biologically male is not something that everyone can just do. It's not transphobia. It's just discomfort. I am not comfortable with the idea that this person was once a ""man"" for all intents and purposes. I understand that they see themselves as a woman, and I support it, but I couldn't date it. That's just not a category of person that I find attractive, and it's bonkers to me that'd you'd make someone feel guilty because of that. 

Dating is 100% up to the preferences of the person looking to date someone. You have no jurisdiction over whom I find attractive or unattractive. I like short, pretty, outgoing, funny, intelligent, casual girls. I prefer that they're not hot-headed or too needy. Trans and bi doesn't sit right with me, and mental illness/disease is one hell of a commitment to make. So am I tall-phobic? Shy-phobic? Dumb-phobic? Do I have a phobia of every group of people I'm not attracted to? I don't hate those girls. I'd be friends with them for sure. I'm friends with all types. I just don't want to date them, and I'm sure they wouldn't wanna date me.

Asking people to be critical of a prejudice is not asking them to submit to fuckin' rape. If you are attracted to women but not attracted to transwomen, as a whole, the only explanation would be that you do not view transwomen as women. We are not demanding that you have sex with anyone. We are asking that you examine why transgenderism is a reason to not be attracted to someone as a way of understanding and challenging the transphobia that is preventing attraction.

So to the other drivel:

1. Yes that was a compromise, they went from a remain position pre-referendum to a soft brexit compromise after
2. No they have said they will back a referendum with remain vs their deal, you are just wrong here, people have made hand graphs about this as people like you pretend to be incapable of comprehending non-binary options. I can find one for you if you like?

1. Labour want their own brexit position. They haven't compromised to get there, that's just their position.

3. As did every other remain party, including the Lib Dems and several Tory's.

Corbyn can't possibly get the votes, the Tory rebels who have already made huge compromises thus far are not willing to budge any further unless Corbyn moves an inch. If they are not on board, it doesn't matter about anyone else, a majority becomes impossible.

On the other hand, any compromise candidate with Labour backing would easily get a majority as Tory rebels out number the small number of lexiteers who will defy the whip.

As to your second point. It is absolutely ridiculous, the Tory rebels have done nothing except threaten and constantly back down. The Lib dems on the other hand have undermined any attempt to pass an alternative to no-deal or May's deal, and have thus brought us right to the brink. I originally thought this was due to a naive (if vaguely admirable) remain absolutism. Swinson in recent weeks has however made it clear they are doing this entirely for party political gain, as such they attempt to scupper any labour solution and blame Corbyn.

ey4yi21,"> Puberty blockers change the endocrine system completely, and the actual signals from your brain to use the endocrine system.

They don't block their production, just reception - and only of sex hormones, not other growth hormones.

> There's limited research so far, but it points to puberty blockers causing problems with sexual organs and bones, there isn't even any long term research yet obviously, but I'm 99% sure it's not going to be good.

This was the case for non-trans people who were on puberty blockers for prolonged stretches of time - sometimes a decade or more. This caused problems due to the persistent lack of sex hormones in an otherwise adult body.

This is not the case for trans people who are on puberty blockers for a comparatively short time, and who eventually either resume their own puberty or go on cross-sex hormone therapy.

> The point I was making is that it's not okay to do either. In fact, a boy wanting to pump himself full of steroids

I was referring to his natural puberty - hence specifying that it's his body doing the pumping. Natural male puberty involves a lot of testosterone.

So if you truly believe that 12 year olds are too young to know what gender they are, then surely the logical course of action would be to make puberty blockers compulsory for everyone. It's otherwise a double standard to say that it's only trans kids who don't know what gender they are, when everyone else does.

> What's worse is I think that some of the time, if parents have a kid who's a feminine boy or a tomboy girl, some (I don't know how many) parents like the idea of having a transgender son/daughter so they egg the kid on into making such a decision, if that's the case then it's straight up child abuse imo.

Theoretically, maybe.

Again, no disrespect, but they don't though, the natural function of the endocrine system is to begin puberty at that age. Puberty blockers change the endocrine system completely, and the actual signals from your brain to use the endocrine system.

>What makes it any more okay for a cis boy to allow his  body to pump itself full of testosterone because he wants to grow into a  man?

You might have wrote that wrong my friend. The point I was making is that it's not okay to do either. In fact, a boy wanting to pump himself full of steroids (unless there is a serious medical condition which requires him to do so) is probably a lot safer than taking puberty blockers (I don't really know for sure), the boy would end up infertile and with heart problems and possible brain problems. The kid that went on puberty blockers would end up with widespread damage throughout their body, to their brain, heart, bones, muscles, fertility, etc since puberty was delayed for so long.

It's just insane in my opinion to actually do this to a child. Prepubescent kids don't even know what it's like to be a man or a woman, they can't possibly even decide that they're actually transgender.

As stated he claims to be  22, works as a supervisor at a factory, and has lived on his own for about six years. It wouldn’t make much sense for him to be living by himself at the age of 16. And it is also would be odd to see someone like him gain a position like that in a short amount of time.

> Well, ""trap"" is almost purely used when referring to anime as far as I've seen, and it is always used as a joke.

It might have started out as a joke, but there're two problems with it. 1) the inception of the joke stems from underlying transphobia; and 2) the ""joke"" has been widely adopted by transphobes to attack trans people by dismissing their existence as trans people.

If you're as willing to learn, ContraPoints did a whole video on this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg) It's pretty long though.

>... it's still a joke. It is dependent on intent and intent only. 

There's so much to unpack on such a simple statement. Racists jokes intends aren't just to make people laugh, it's to make people who align with racist ideals laugh. The intent is to reinforce the position of racists by allowing them to laugh at the group of people that they hate. The same goes for all jokes that are designed to attack marginalised people and maintaining the status quo.

Even the most boundary pushing stand up comics have long understood one thing - it's not the topic at hand that's taboo, what you're saying with the joke. There are plenty of white comics who dive into racial material and not been seen as racist, because they're not punching down at the minorities - but up at the system and social mentality that caused and perpetuated these situations. Even rape jokes can be told without minimising the suffering of rape victim, Cameron Esposito did a whole special called Rape Jokes.

Also, Intent vs Impact isn't something new. We're very good at justifying our own actions by intents, but other people on their impact. You're demonstrating that yourself by arguing that /u/sewingshadows is being hostile when it's not their intent. You need to pick a side there.

> You say their preferred identity should not be up for debate. I'm sorry, but I disagree. 

I'm going to assume that you're willing to change your position given the timing of your reply to my comment being made after this statement.

>I will, however, continue to ""tone police"" because when I try to speak to somebody I expect us both to keep our cool. 

There's actually a Wikipedia article on the reason why tone policing is a bad thing:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone\_policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing)

I don't want to jump to conclusion here but I wouldn't be surprised if you've either been on the receiving end of emotional arguments on this topic, or seen it happen. But the thing is, people have every right to be emotional when talking about a topic that affects them in their daily lives.

The civil rights movement didn't stem from a group of people sipping tea from fine china and concurring with each other that ""yes indeed, I suppose we should do something about this racial injustice"". It came from a huge amount of suffering, pain, and anger that minorities went through and wanting to do something about it.

This is exactly why tone policing is bullshit. It's easy to be civil and unemotional about something that doesn't affect you, but to dismiss a group of people for being emotional about something they have suffered a great deal through is to minimise their experience and redirect the topic at hand. It's a classic position taken by the oppressors.",transphobia,blackbutler,I didn’t know if I should’ve posted this,https://reddit.com/r/blackbutler/comments/cufdhk/i_didnt_know_if_i_shouldve_posted_this/ey4yrs4/
ey49qqi,"Well, ""trap"" is almost purely used when referring to anime as far as I've seen, and it is always used as a joke. I don't care too much for fictional characters and I'm not sentimental so symbols aren't high on my priority list. 

joke

noun

a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline.

""A thing that someone says *to cause amusement*..."" A joke is a joke, if it's a bad joke, a racist joke, a transphobic joke or a downright mean joke, it's still a joke. It is dependent on intent and intent only.

What I found hostile about your statement is that it seemed as though you were calling *me* transphobic and shitty for saying that comment. Not only that but how I interpreted your tone. You call it tone policing but when one person yells at another, and the second person tells them to stop, I see nothing wrong with that. If I see someone being emotional I will, as you say, ""call them out for it"" I remain calm when doing so, not to come off as superior or pompous but because it would be hypocritical of me to tell one not to react overemotionally, *in an overemotional tone*.

You say their preferred identity should not be up for debate. I'm sorry, but I disagree. The introduction of the idea that transgender people are what they prefer to be to the public is fairly recent. When everyone sees a man petending to be a woman who says they are one, they doubt him, and the same for the reverse. That may seem wrong to you but emotions have no bearing on objectivity. I don't want to make anyone upset but I'm not going to ignore what is true to please them. However, there has been study and it may very well be true that at least on a mental level, these people are the same as the other sex.

The burden of proof is on the one who makes the claim. People with Gender Dysphoria being what they desire to be is a claim that requires evidence to believe. I am taking the default stance of disbelief toward a new idea that may or may not be true.

Perhaps I was misinformed or haven't spent enough time. I promise you I will do my very best to inform myself but from my current knowledge, there is no legitimate evidence.

I have no intention of being condescending and I desire to be nothing but reasonable, however if I see someone reacting emotionally I will not accept that. If you were not reacting emotionally, I am sorry for my misinterpretation. I will, however, continue to ""tone police"" because when I try to speak to somebody I expect us both to keep our cool.",transphobic,blackbutler,I didn’t know if I should’ve posted this,https://reddit.com/r/blackbutler/comments/cufdhk/i_didnt_know_if_i_shouldve_posted_this/ey49qqi/
ey3ipe5,"If you call a trans woman a trap then you're essentially saying that her womanhood is a lie so yeah, that is transphobic. Jokes can be transphobic in the same way they can be racist or homophobic. 

Can you explain what you found hostile about ""Calling them traps is transphobic and shitty.""? It wasn't my intention and I regret giving off that kind of vibe, but I'd like to know where, exactly, you find the hostility in that statement because I don't see it.

Perhaps the reason people tell you to do your own research is because for trans people, justifying their existence to people who, in most cases, aren't willing to listen is tiring and they shouldn't be expected to educate others on why they should be allowed to exist as their preferred gender. Their identities shouldn't be up for debate and yet they are, here and everywhere else, and when you have skin in the game it can be incredibly difficult to defend your identity time and time again.

And whilst we're talking about research, I don't really understand what evidence you could have looked at to convince you that trans women are not women. Science and progressive thought are most definitely on the side of the trans community, so could you tell me your sources so that I have a better understanding of where you're coming from?

If you say that trans women aren't women then you're invalidating their existence as women. If you don't want to be insulted then perhaps you should consider how you would feel if someone undermined your identity.

Jokes do cause harm if they're told for the sole purpose of ridiculing a marginalised group you don't belong to. Humour can be just as effective as outward displays of hatred in enforcing bigotry, perhaps even more so since any backlash can be written off with ""it was just a joke!"". And we expect jokes to be funny so if a joke fails to be funny, despite the author's intentions, how can we still consider it a valid joke? 

You are choosing to see the character as something she is not. You are calling her a he when she expresses that she is most definitely a she, over and over again. When you label her as a man you erase her transness because that isn't who she is.

Intention doesn't equate to interpretation. You might not think you're being condescending but repeatedly calling me emotional and tone policing what I've said is pretty damn insulting. It would be great if you could not do that.",trans woman,blackbutler,I didn’t know if I should’ve posted this,https://reddit.com/r/blackbutler/comments/cufdhk/i_didnt_know_if_i_shouldve_posted_this/ey3ipe5/
ey1vxe1,"""Trap"" is a term commonly used in a casual tone. It mostly is not meant with ill will but just as a joke. It's not ""transphobic"" to tell a joke. It's transphobic to send actual messages of hatred or discrimination because of someone's Gender Dysphoria.

I thought you weren't being calm or civil because ""transwomen are women, calling them traps is transphobic and shitty"" is an undoubtedly hostile statement. I perceived it as emotionally driven. I am not wrong to share your moral values but if there are objective matters you are willing to explain to me, once again, please do so. I am not gaslighting, I genuinely perceived hostility. I apologize if you saw me as condescendimg.

The paragraph was a bit out of left field, I admit. My purpose was that I am often told to ""Do my research"" by people who disagree with me on this topic, and I don't understand why they can't just tell me the information they've gathered, rather than saying ""You're wrong, go look it up and prove me right"". And I was saying that I have attempted to find honest proof but have found none. Perhaps I just didn't spend enough time looking. 

I believe you took what I said as wrong, I have *no* problem with you questioning me. I mean I have been told by others to research *their* side for them rather than having them tell me of what they should already know. I do want discussion. I am open to being questioned. However, you would have little to ask of me. I don't believe transwomen or transmen are women or men because I see no proof of such. I deny the claim, my stance is default. If you can prove you are right, I will gladly take your side. I *am* willing to change my mind if your claims stand criticism.

""And saying transwomen aren't women isn't a difference of opinion, it's invalidating peoples' existence based on your own bigoted views.""Well as I said you may believe this to be an objective matter and clearly you do. I am not ""invalidating their existence"" as existence doesn't require validation, it simply is. Also, don't insult me, prove me wrong. 

""Doesn't matter if you meant harm by saying it, you are still causing harm"" ""A joke has to be funny, otherwise it isn't a joke."" If an individual does not meam harm to a group, they eould apologize for doing so. However jokes do not do harm. You can be offended or you can ignor the joke. Also, no, a joke does not *have* to be funny. Many jokes downright suck or are perceived as funny or unfunny by different people. A joke is a joke if the individual *intends* it to be one. If that individual pisses everyone off, it's still a joke, just a bad one.

When I refer to Grell as a he, I am not ""erasing transgender representation"". He is *still* represented as transgender, me calling her that does not make a difference. Once again, please explain this ""validation"" I don't see why it's necesary or even what you mean in saying so.

Look, I may be getting the wrong idea, but I am still percieving you to be reacting emotionally. I'm not condescending, that's just the idea I'm getting. If you want to change people's minds, please don't be so rude.",transphobic,blackbutler,I didn’t know if I should’ve posted this,https://reddit.com/r/blackbutler/comments/cufdhk/i_didnt_know_if_i_shouldve_posted_this/ey1vxe1/
ey1iz5q,"I wasn't arguing with you. Trans women are women, and calling them traps is transphobic and shitty. Those points weren't up for discussion.

Also what makes you think I'm not calm or civil just because I'm calling you out? If you don't want to be called a transphobe then don't say/write transphobic things. I don't have to be worked up to point that out, so the gaslighting and condescension is really unnecessary.

That whole *do your research* paragraph seems a bit out of left field. I hadn't asked you to do your research or made any comment even slightly related to asking for evidence, but it gives you a nice little get out if I ask you for sources or ask why you don't think trans women should be considered women, doesn't it, because then I'm just doing the same thing everyone before me has said. Puts the onus on me to do all of the heavy lifting and providing evidence and whatnot, yes? You say you're happy to have a discussion except this kind of response immediately prevents discourse because you're not open to being questioned.

And saying trans women aren't women isn't a difference of opinion, it's invalidating peoples' existence based on your own bigoted views. Doesn't matter if you don't mean harm by saying it, you are still causing harm.

A joke has to be funny, otherwise it isn't a joke. Plus it doesn't really matter whether Grell is fictional or not; she's a representation of a marginalised minority who has stated in an interview panel in the manga that she is a trans woman.

ey1f8fg,"Ok. First of all, relax. I never wanted an argument. 


Second of all, I disagree. While I am fine with calling people whatever they want, that is out of common courtesy. Now if you'd like to discuss this further in a civil and relaxed manner, feel free to message me but simply put I disagree, I see no evidence of trans woman being women.


Everytime I say this, I am told ""Do your research"" and that tells me that the people responding don't actually have their facts straight and are asking *me* to validate *their* point. Surely you can see how that is ridiculous. Anyway, I have done my research and I have found no evidence of such. If you disagree with me, please tell me why, because I honestly want people to share information rather than screaming at each other. 


The LGBTQ community gets a bad reputation mainly because of the hostile and easily provoked nature. Labels such as ""Transphobic"" and ""Homophobic"" are quickly laid upon people who don't share the same opinion or say a simple joke that never meant any harm. If you believe it is an objective matter rather than subjective and that their opinions are simply false information, *educate them*. Not through anger and vitriol but through calm conversation and reasoning. When they question the validity of your claims, *show them evidence*. Proof goes a long way, even with idiots. (Of course, around some I would advise avoiding news media as they may discredit it due to indoctrination)


Anyway, I was *joking* when I said ""trap"" and keep in mind that Grell is a fictional character. As for the sexual interest thing, I don't mind who is in to what, I was stating my opinion.

I’m well aware of that. However concealing ones gender identity surely is. Especially on dating apps where you are given a choice to express your identity in full. 

No one should be hidden from public view either. 
I’ve never said anyone should be hidden, did I? 
If someone has open preferences, they can view them all, but if someone has a thinner range of interests, they should be able to view within that limit too.

Have you? Cause this whole time as you’ve been explaining trans folks to me, you are literally describing them as wild animals that one must work with to gain their trust to expose their true identity and then find out their not even compatible to you if that is the actual case. 
Which quite frankly just puts more trans folks in danger. 

I can talk to my own trans friends and not be jacked around by such nonsense. 

And while I can surely ask a monogamous a woman if they fit my criteria, it’s fucking rude to ask a trans person what’s in their pants. It’s rude to ask anyone what’s in their pants directly, which I believe many would unanimously agree on. 

And I haven’t hit your personal examples cause I already said they are irrelevant in the context of the conversation. If someone wants preferences to dick size, salary and how many things have been up their ass, there’s sites for that. Fetlife?
Never said anyone couldn’t post whatever they like.  I’m not going to ask women if they are at risk of breast cancer and if they are going to lose their breasts cause that’s none of my damn business.

But nobody should be with someone they are incompatible with unknowingly. Period. You wouldn’t have a gay woman to date a cis-man blindly. Or vice versa. No one should be going anywhere on a date where they have to second guess the identity of their potentials. It is purely reckless in today’s hookup culture. 

There is nothing wrong with stating you like a certain thing and expect to find JUST that thing in your preferences without others there to confuse you. 

This is why I can’t stress enough that correct labels are 100% appropriate and should be used.

Have you considered that these women are actual people? You can actually talk to them? Ask them questions maybe? Ascertain whether you think you're compatible through conversation? The same as you would with anyone else. 

How exactly do you think you would accidentally get too far with a monogamous person? You can literally ask them that question within ten minutes of messaging on a dating app?

You haven't addressed my specific examples. Why can't you just post your preferences in your dating profile? Do you think you should be required to publicly disclose specifics about your genitals because I might not think they're what I'm looking for? You've implied that I shouldn't have to talk to you in order to find out that information because you can't change it. What if male pattern baldness runs in your family? You can't change that either but you probably don't think all men should have to post about their hereditary likelihood of hair loss.",trans women,AskReddit,"Straight People, what do you want to ask about the LGBTQ+ community that you wouldn't ask in real life?",https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cvhgqx/straight_people_what_do_you_want_to_ask_about_the/ey4wutv/
ey4wdhx,"By “our” fault, I mean everyone.
Meaning anyone viewing in that range of preferences. 

And no, see. That is a problem. 
I and others don’t have to put up with talking to anyone we already know doesn’t meet our criteria. We shouldn’t have to play a guessing game with people to figure out if we are actually compatible past the basics of what should be already explained in the profile choices if applicable or obviously seen.

Is our junk compatible? 
Am I attractive to you?
Ideal age range?
Similar ideals? 
Etc etc etc.

I and others shouldn’t have to walk in a theoretical minefield to appease trans folks comfort zones that WE did not contribute to personally or vice versa. No person should feel they have to guess about their possible date, that isn’t fair or safe at all for anyone.

The “awkward situation” I was referring to was actually to that of me(non-monogamous) getting too far with someone who was monogamous.
Cause that IS awkward. And I bet it’d be awkward too for someone to grab dick when they weren’t expecting dick. But that’s besides the point. 

Your personal turn-offs/turn ons do not get to override someones sexual preferences and shouldn’t matter until you actually begin to talk to that person. Cause as always in conversations that seem to happen about this- you’re telling me everyone should just deal with these mind games and quite frankly I find that hypocritical of the movement and unfair. No one should be forced to talk to or even go out with individuals they are sexually incompatible with JUST to get the correct answer. *Especially of things they cannot change*.

That’s just plain irresponsible.
Honestly it seems you’re putting all the pressure on cis-men to not beat up trans women when honestly nobody should be beating up anybody and/or causing general fuckery online with their possible matchups, but alas I believe in a perfect world which doesn’t seem to exist.",trans women,AskReddit,"Straight People, what do you want to ask about the LGBTQ+ community that you wouldn't ask in real life?",https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cvhgqx/straight_people_what_do_you_want_to_ask_about_the/ey4wdhx/
ey4u530,"I'm not sure what you mean when you say it isn't ""our"" fault. By and large it is cis men who pose the most danger to trans women. So if that's the ""us"" then yes, it is your fault. And you can totally and completely put up with having a conversation with someone you'll find out soon that you're not interested in dating if the alternative is that she is required to risk her safety.   


Unless you think that whatever I consider to be my personal turn-offs should be required to be posted, it doesn't make any sense for you to require this of trans women.  


So if I personally didn't want to date any man with a penis smaller than 7"", would that suddenly make it reasonable to require that all men disclose that as a condition of using a dating site? What if I don't want to date someone who earns less than $70k? Should that be required? What if I really feel like it's important for me to know if you've ever put anything in your butt for sexual pleasure? Should that be on the public site where your face is visible alongside that information? What if the thing that I felt was really important to me was something that could cause you to lose your job? Like someone in your HR department uses that dating site and sees something where they could legally just fire you? But to me it's a deal-breaker so you should be obligated to post it.  
I mean, if you can't be up front about your compatibility with me, why should I have to endure even the most basic conversation with you?   


This idea that cis men have that trans women are going to get hot and heavy and you'll reach down and discover she has a penis which may be the ""awkward encounter"" you're referring to is a red herring. Again, trans women will do what it takes to not get killed or assaulted. So they're very unlikely to put themselves in a situation where someone will assault or kill them, which includes reaching a point of physical intimacy without having informed someone that their anatomy might not be what you expect. And given that these days most adults probably reach a stage of physical intimacy around the fourth date, it's not like she's going to be stringing you along forever without bringing it up. Likely she will try to gauge your general comfort with trans people pretty early on because despite the inference, she is also looking for someone to date and doesn't want to waste her own time either.

ey4th65,"I’m specifically requesting info In the profile.

I see you had a separate conversation and they summed it up well. 

Good dating sites are actually quite inclusive now of all(most) genders, titles, labels, etc. 

If someone is a trans woman, they should list themselves as such. And if I adjust my preferences to view only cis-women for example, I shouldn’t see trans individuals there. And following your other convo is why I expect that and my reasons for it.

Honesty and safety. 
I expect and actually give full honesty and disclosure in my dating profiles as an actively dating, polyamorous person for example.

If someone can not be honest with me up front about their incompatibility with me, it’ll just lead to a very awkward encounter down the road. 

While on the flip side, I do not- and never have condoned or wish assault of trans women for them listing that they are. I believe it’s a total travesty that individuals would go out of their way to commit such heinous acts And why I believe everyone should be more careful and practice safer dating habits no matter who you are.

For their safety(everyone’s safety really), I find labels extremely important. 

I do not go around assuming trans women labeling themselves as women(on applicable sites) are there to catfish people. I honestly don’t. However you can not not expect a few to go “wtf?” when they have their personal preferences showing different catches than they expect. That isn’t our fault.

And Notch isn't a meme on the channel? Shapiro has pretty much the same opinion as Notch regarding people with gender dysphoria as I said above.

Gender dysphoria is an actual mental illness.

> and heightening the suicide rates of trans people.

Maybe it's the fact that they suffer from a serious mental illness and they believe they were born with the *wrong* sexual organs that attribute more to the suicide rates? Does telling people with body dysmorphia that they suffer from body dysmorphia result in higher suicide rates? No. It's silly to attempt to attribute the extremely high suicide rate of people with gender dysphoria solely to people who question your ideology when Occam's Razor would suggest that it is the mental illness itself and the resulting symptoms that causes it.",,PewdiepieSubmissions,Very epic Notch,https://reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/cvhwhg/very_epic_notch/ey4w0r6/

ey4xods,">It's called gender dysphoria for a reason, because you have a distorted image of your own body.

That's literally not the reason why it's called that, or the physiological mechanism through which the condition manifests itself, though.  
You're thinking of [body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder), an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder that has a lot in common with anorexia nervosa. Completely different condition, and that's why it's treatments are completely different as well. 

---

In simple terms, gender dysphoria is ultimately rooted in specific portions of the brain involved in the proper processing of sex hormones errently developing along the path intended for the opposite sex. 

As a result, those with it suffer from the same depressive symptoms that people without it suffer from in response to abnormally elevated levels of the opposite sexes sex hormones, and reduced levels of their own set of sex hormones.  

If anyone's interested I could explain the evolutionary reasons behind this reaction, but for now just understand that it's the normal and expected reaction. 

But for people with GD it's obviously a problem, because it's their own body which is producing the set of sex hormones which the relevant portions of the brain are errantly configured to recognize as a problem. 

And we don't have the technology to change those structures in the brain, so instead we do the next best thing, which is artificially providing the set of sex hormones the brain is configured to properly respond to.  
This treatment is called cross-sex hormone replacement therapy, and it's the portion of transitioning where the massive decrease in suicidality rates between treated and untreated patients with GD occurs. 

This mechanism is also the reason why there are a bunch of criteria which need to be met in order to be prescribed HRT; someone who doesn't actually have GD is likely to experience the rapid onset of depressive symptoms withing a few weeks of beginning the treatment, which can obviously be quite dangerous.

>The left believes that gender is a construct that is how you feel

That's also not really true, and based on a common misconception. 

Namely, you're inadvertently conflating the concept of [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) with that of [gender roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role). It's an easy mistake to make, given that they're both commonly referred to by the shorthand of ""gender"". 

Gender roles is the one that refers to a social construct. Things like the notion that boys like blue, girls like pink, boys play with trucks, girls play with dolls, and those sorts of things. Those are gender roles.

Gender identity, on the other hand, is very much recognized by the left to be biological in nature. That's why the left isn't in favor of things like conversion therapy.",gender identity,PewdiepieSubmissions,"Thank you notch, very cool!",https://reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/cvittv/thank_you_notch_very_cool/ey4xods/

ey4yspk,"What exactly are these ""transgender traits"" that are unique to transgender people and not everyone else? Maybe the unusual height or build of a trans girl? But these are not traits of 'transgenderism', they're simply aspect of someone's physicality. **Of course** it's not necessarily transphobic or prejudiced to not be attracted to a trans woman or trans guy's body. 

Similarly, I refute the idea that being transgender has any direct correlation to personality. Again, what are these consistent 'transgender traits' are that necessarily have serious impact on a trans person's personality?

>You imply If I don’t find the idea of a trans person personally attractive (or at least not repellent) then by definition I am prejudiced.

All I'm suggesting is that if you **exclusively** aren't attracted to the **idea** of a trans person, then that is not a problem of just attraction to personality or physicality. It my opinion, it very possibly stems from something deeper, and ideological. This is what I was suggesting **may** be influenced by prejudice. But not necessarily intentionally!! I don't have the right or the knowledge to claim why someone is really thinking something. 

Also, if this prejudice exists like I think it does, it affects pretty much everyone. It's hard not to be affected, because we live in a society that has dismissed the existence of transgender identity until very recently.

And I will say ONE MORE TIME that I do not believe you can CONTROL what you innately find attractive, nor that lack of attraction to tangible elements of a personality is necessarily based in prejudice.

Yet further, you essentially make the same argument that you say isn’t being made. You imply If I don’t find the idea of a trans person personally attractive (or at least not repellent) then by definition I am prejudiced.

ey51lor,"I’ve had discussions with some of my trans friends, and not all of them are too happy about someone referring to them as “fish”. The issue surrounding whether a trans person is ‘passable’ comes into play, so some aren’t keen on the phrase being applied to them. My friends are drag and burlesque performers, but they don’t see fishy as being a compliment. They are feminine because they ARE women, and their bodies are that of a woman, so whatever shape and size they are, they are a woman. If one person is fish, does that mean some of their other trans sisters aren’t, and ultimately, are they less of a woman in the eyes of others? It can be another way for a “masculine” looking trans woman to be or feel dismissed and invalidated because they aren’t considered to be “fish”, despite them feeling feminine, and seeing themselves as feminine because they are a woman. Of course, not all women have to be feminine. We know that’s bullshit, but it’s a sensitive matter for some trans women.

This won’t be the case for every trans person. My friends don’t speak for everyone, and I certainly don’t either. “Fish” was and is used within trans communities to mean to same thing - someone who is incredibly feminine.

I personally steer away from referring to a trans woman as fish for the reasons my friends discussed. It was an interesting conversation, and I learned a lot from them. Again, yes, it’s not a problem for everyone. Some trans people may disagree and see no harm in the word, but there are still others who aren’t comfortable with it. As I understand where my friends were coming from, I stick to using fishy as a compliment to cis men who are drag queens, or performers who I know are comfortable with the term.

Sure it is. All Abrahamic religions are *inherently*, theologically, structurally, and historically, patriarchal, and misogynistic. That's not to say some schools haven't tried to distance themselves from their roots over time (Jews who accept female rabbis, or protestant churches that accept female pastors, for example) or that the mystical branches of those religions aren't more progressive in their spiritual teachings (but that has never been the majority of religious practitioners). But if you take a peek at the Old Testament, it's a bloody, violent, xenophobic, war-mongering saga of war, rape, vengeance, incest, and cowering in fear before a wrathful, rage-o-holic big daddy god with an ego as fragile as Trump's.

To go with real world examples, the Overton was very important when thinking about the abolishment of Jim Crow laws in the 60s. As it became mainstream to be less racist, the Overton window and those within it became less racist. HOWEVER, the Overton window was also the reason why so many Germans followed Hitler despite the laws he broke when he came into power and started WW2. The Overton window contains people who just go along with things, good and bad. The Overton is the center, it’s where the centrists live. And because people in the center don’t fight for a particular set of beliefs, and instead go with the flow, it can make them one of the most dangerous political ideologies.

Firstly it matters where I stick my penis into and how does that feels for me. Also surgically created women's vagina and surgically created vagina for men is still different.

“Even if the prenatal environment can nudge the body and the brain in different directions, that’s probably only one facet of the forces underlying gender dysphoria, says Kreukels. The full picture, she explains, is likely to be ‘a combination between biological, psychological, and social factors—because we really think it’s a complex interplay between all these factors, and thus far research has not given a solution for that.’”

I'm making untestable statements, and you're responding by being dismissive.  Sure you're not a guy?  This is such typical guy behavior....

If there were a convenient way to test the statements I'm making, I'd invite you to get right on it.  There's not.

I notice that you're not contesting the right of Ben and Alex to be the man they are inside, but when I mention a woman who is physically, socially, and behaviorally a woman, you get all prickly and full of denial
  Again, sure you're not a guy?  This is such a tired guy trope - getting freaked out that there's women with dicks.

As for me being dismissive of your purported superpowers, yup.  Guilty.  When I watch cute cis/het lasses coming up at a party and flirting with my FtM friends, who are good looking guys, after all, I have to imagine that these superpowers are inconsistent at best.  As for the MtF folks I've known, yup, most of them have something that is observably different, mostly because structural changes happen in male puberty that don't for women.  A few don't, and you and I can't tell just standing there talking with them.

Now, your disrespectful treatment of fellow humans...

There's a cadre of folks out there who have assigned a place for women.  It involves not bothering your pretty heads with all that ""thinking"" stuff, and leaving real decisions to the men who can handle such things.  Your expressed attitude about trans folks aligns very closely, possibly exactly, with theirs.  Are you sure you wish to be that guy?

You insist on being a rude asshole to people who have never offended you, spoken to you, or even thought about you, to people you have never met, and never will meet.  You're dismissive of the feelings, concerns, of the very existence of these people.  Are you certain you want to be that guy?

And of course you think there’s nothing anyone could feel or experience that you don’t share, when you think they're objects demanding your dismissal and denial instead of humans with their own unique set if experiences that you don’t share.  Are you really that guy?

Lastly, and this is really the only question I'm really curious about.  Why the hell are you so invested in denying and dehumanizing people?  I am serious, and the acceptable range of answers is about your motivation, not about who has DNA or dicks - you, not them.  I really am curious.

To answer a possible question up front,, my motive in telling you that you are wrong to do this is simple.  I care very much for my friends, and for my daughter's friends.

Seriously, what is a biological female? When we talk about sex, we're referring to 5 things

1. Genitalia (penis, clitoris, scrotum, labia etc.)
2. Gonads (testes/ovaries)
3. Hormonal profile
4. Internal reproductive anatomy (Uterus, prostate etc.)
5. Chromosomes

So, a trans woman who medically transitions and opts for an orchiectomy and vaginoplasty is clearly not of the male sex on the first 3 - arguably 4 given the reduction in prostate size - and a trans man with an oophorectomy, hysterectomy and phalloplasty is clearly not of the female sex on the first 4.

ey4xods,">It's called gender dysphoria for a reason, because you have a distorted image of your own body.

That's literally not the reason why it's called that, or the physiological mechanism through which the condition manifests itself, though.  
You're thinking of [body dysmorphic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder), an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder that has a lot in common with anorexia nervosa. Completely different condition, and that's why it's treatments are completely different as well. 

---

In simple terms, gender dysphoria is ultimately rooted in specific portions of the brain involved in the proper processing of sex hormones errently developing along the path intended for the opposite sex. 

As a result, those with it suffer from the same depressive symptoms that people without it suffer from in response to abnormally elevated levels of the opposite sexes sex hormones, and reduced levels of their own set of sex hormones.  

If anyone's interested I could explain the evolutionary reasons behind this reaction, but for now just understand that it's the normal and expected reaction. 

But for people with GD it's obviously a problem, because it's their own body which is producing the set of sex hormones which the relevant portions of the brain are errantly configured to recognize as a problem. 

And we don't have the technology to change those structures in the brain, so instead we do the next best thing, which is artificially providing the set of sex hormones the brain is configured to properly respond to.  
This treatment is called cross-sex hormone replacement therapy, and it's the portion of transitioning where the massive decrease in suicidality rates between treated and untreated patients with GD occurs. 

This mechanism is also the reason why there are a bunch of criteria which need to be met in order to be prescribed HRT; someone who doesn't actually have GD is likely to experience the rapid onset of depressive symptoms withing a few weeks of beginning the treatment, which can obviously be quite dangerous.

>The left believes that gender is a construct that is how you feel

That's also not really true, and based on a common misconception. 

Namely, you're inadvertently conflating the concept of [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) with that of [gender roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role). It's an easy mistake to make, given that they're both commonly referred to by the shorthand of ""gender"". 

Gender roles is the one that refers to a social construct. Things like the notion that boys like blue, girls like pink, boys play with trucks, girls play with dolls, and those sorts of things. Those are gender roles.

Gender identity, on the other hand, is very much recognized by the left to be biological in nature. That's why the left isn't in favor of things like conversion therapy.",gender identity,PewdiepieSubmissions,"Thank you notch, very cool!",https://reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/cvittv/thank_you_notch_very_cool/ey4xods/

pls stop talking, this is just cringy now. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. 

>From the mouths of trans women who get rejected by dates when it is revealed that they are trans, the dysphoria gets much worse along with thoughts of suicide

First of all, ""the dysphoria gets worse along with thoughts of suicide"" 
Wrong. 
Studies show transitioning aliviates gender dysphoria and help the mental health of trans people. 


Omg you're hilarious. 

Did you seriously just say ""transitioning doesn't work because trans women get rejected on dates"". 

That's probably the worst argument I have ever heard from a transphobe. Congrats. 

So, trans women do feel dysphoric whje the are rejected. No because they transition, but because someone doesn't see them as women. It has nothing nothing to do with transition.

Also, them getting sad because they got rejected has nothing to do with transitioning. 
It has to do with the fact that they got rejected. 

Cis people can also get depressed from being rejected. 


>Forcing society to state that you are A when you're really Z


I sent tons of links that show that trans people have the brain of the gender they identify as. 

So they are the gender they identify as. This is a scientific fact. 
You can read the studies and educate yourself or keep being ignorant. Your choice. 


>Your dysphoria shouldn't trump reality or the safety of girls and women either.

That's an irrational argument since I have never argued that we should harm women and girls.



Is this how you always argue? Using scientifically incorrect statements and by accusing other of harming people?

ey54yim,"No fucking shit. 

A silver lining to this shit storm is that while unfortunately racial tension is higher it has allowed those who are racists to feel like they can express their repugnant beliefs finally being honest about what they really are. In a way their vileness empowers us, it identifies them, it gives us clear and direct quotes to use against them should they be an elected official / or to rally to boycott them. 

Another positive is that in sharing their repugnant beliefs they provide me a plethora of examples to teach my spawn about: what kind of people to avoid, how much harm words can cause, and why compassion and understanding are so crucial for society to thrive. 

It’s infuriating that with all the technological advancements and achievements of this century that so many people still violently cling and entwine themselves with hatred and division. These people don’t believe in equality, they literally can’t believe in equality while still believing that some races are better than others, that a sexuality is better than others, that a gender identity is better than others (in that accepting their gender at birth is better than questioning it or rejecting it later), that a citizenship is better than others or lack there of. That fact makes it hard to argue with them and hard to work towards equality for all as their beliefs demand that there be a loser so there can be a winner. That belief system allows one to understand what motivates their feeling that they are losing rights / their claims that white men have it the worst of anyone right now. With their beliefs if another group is getting a chance then they must be getting less of a chance because if someone is getting something then someone else isn’t. Because they’ve spent centuries oppressing others so they could “win” any change means they aren’t the winners and are therefore the losers. They cannot grasp that when everyone is equal everyone wins without there needing anyone to be a sacrificial / vilified loser. 

It’s frustrating and disheartening at times, but that doesn’t stop me from working towards equality for all. That doesn’t stop me from treating everyone like humans regardless of skin color, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender, religious beliefs, age, disability, etc. And that’s how we will overcome this hatred.

ey55rcp,">genetic men and women are different. On a whole range of physical attributes and psychological issues, men and women approach and see things differently

But so do men and other men, and women and other women. I believe there are indeed some general psychological differences between male and females - for example, I'm pretty sure guys have naturally better spacial awareness. I *don't* know if these differences have much real bearing on a person's personality - I think probably social context and messaging informs a person's personality far more - but I don't know how important any of this nitpicking is anyway.

You present the idea of not being attracted to a transgender person by virtue of the intrinsic, 'genetic' psychological traits of the gender they were assigned at birth. Now, I don't really understand how you could trace your attraction or lack thereof to these nebulous psychological differences, but let's assume you can. This is *still based on characteristics of a person's identity that are **not** dependent on 'transgenderedness'.*

Let's say being 'genetically' female consistently gives you the tangible personality trait *X*. If a trans guy thus also presents *X*, and *you aren't attracted to this trait*, then your lack of attraction is based on the trait *X* rather than transgender identity. This might seem like nitpicking, but I'm trying to show that you can't really 'logically' justify aversion to transgendered people just by virtue of their trans identity without taking into account possible prejudice or whatever.

But, again, I don't really buy the idea of any genetic trait that is unique to and consistent within guys or girls that influence your attraction to them.

>And so sheathing a genetic male in a female exterior does not black-and-white magically make that person female.

This is an argument that's often brought against trans people, and is pretty separate from our discussions up to this point.
You start by supposing male gender is purely 'genetic', but then claim that transgenderism is just hiding that reality in a female 'exterior'.
What makes that exterior female?
Probably the way she presents herself and interacts in society. Now, there are different schools of thought about this, but many believe that this social presentation and interaction is what gender actually essentially IS - just a social performance that serves to ""define and maintain identities"". This concept is called performativity and it's really fucking complex, but there's shit about it online to read about.

So someone's gender isn't an innate binary mode of being within their genetics; it actually exists AS the way they present their identity - it follows logically that a person who is, to all extents and purposes, presenting and performing a gender, they ARE that gender.

Asking for proof of the contrary is meaningless to me. There's a philosophical concept called the 'p-zombie' that's used in the philosophy of mind. It's a being that outwardly presents and behaves **exactly** like a human, but lacks any form of conscious experience or sentience. How does it prove that it's otherwise, and what use is it to question this anyway? We don't go around questioning people's consciousness or the existence of their mind, because it's a waste of time and isn't useful. Neither is questioning the gender identity of trans people, but of course this continues because people are sceptical.",transgender,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey55rcp/

That’s in addition to gender dysphoria coming with its own set of potential psychological issues.

ey4yspk,"What exactly are these ""transgender traits"" that are unique to transgender people and not everyone else? Maybe the unusual height or build of a trans girl? But these are not traits of 'transgenderism', they're simply aspect of someone's physicality. **Of course** it's not necessarily transphobic or prejudiced to not be attracted to a trans woman or trans guy's body. 

Similarly, I refute the idea that being transgender has any direct correlation to personality. Again, what are these consistent 'transgender traits' are that necessarily have serious impact on a trans person's personality?

>You imply If I don’t find the idea of a trans person personally attractive (or at least not repellent) then by definition I am prejudiced.

All I'm suggesting is that if you **exclusively** aren't attracted to the **idea** of a trans person, then that is not a problem of just attraction to personality or physicality. It my opinion, it very possibly stems from something deeper, and ideological. This is what I was suggesting **may** be influenced by prejudice. But not necessarily intentionally!! I don't have the right or the knowledge to claim why someone is really thinking something. 

Also, if this prejudice exists like I think it does, it affects pretty much everyone. It's hard not to be affected, because we live in a society that has dismissed the existence of transgender identity until very recently.

ey577ed,">Pride... has only done harm

Take your opinion in it's simplest form.  I think you're disregarding where Pride started and came from and only looking at what Pride is today from a perspective of modern society.  Attitudes have changed so quickly that people forget how recently it was they started changing.  Obviously there's still prejudice, but 20 years ago that prejudice was far more pervasive.

There was still don't ask, don't tell policies.  There were a whopping 3 states where gay people could get married, but even then their home state didn't have to recognize it. In 2009, only 31% of the country favoured same-sex marriage.  Today it's double that (even by political party it's drastically changed -- 45% of republicans are even in favour of same-sex marriage now).   

Pride allowed gay people to be publicly gay and feel safe doing it.  Gay families went to Disney during Pride and were surrounded by families just like them and they didn't feel the need to keep it hidden.  Parades made the gay community visible to everyone.The first Pride marches pre-date the AIDS epidemic and were largely in response to the Stonewall riots.  

Not even all states today explicitly protect gender identity and sexual orientation in hate crime laws.  Adoption rights are only recently getting protection on the federal level (and we're talking a gay person being allowed to adopt their same-sex partners biological kid, as well as joint adoption).

Is Pride commercialized today?  Sure.  Is it problematic in a lot of ways?  Absolutely.  But does what it is today mean it has *only* done harm?  Definitely not.  Pride played a huge role in getting LGBTQ+ seen by the broader population.  And you can't think or care about people you don't know exist and are hurting.",gender identity,changemyview,CMV: Pride is overrated and has only done harm for the views on homosexual relations,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvmc9h/cmv_pride_is_overrated_and_has_only_done_harm_for/ey577ed/

First, have you studied and compared the two prison systems and can you provide a synopsis of the major differences between the two systems?

Second, it's not an issue of rules/regs. It's an issue of ""will a transgengerd person create problems if in a facility based on their chosen sex and not their actual sex?

You're asserting that Wardens and US Prison policy makers are going to stick their heads in the sand and not even consider or be aware of what happens in other countries - especially the one we are most like and on which most of our laws are based?

It goes the other way too; if you’re gonna get mad because a player is gay, or even just acts “gay”, in a campaign, this game isn’t for you; those are examples I can think of right now, and not much more cuz I can’t sleep at 4:30 AM. Now, I’m also not saying that doing that isn’t ok, it’s all part of freedom of speech, fantasy rpg, yada yada, I just don’t think those are ways to play without very strictly going over the rules and conditions with the party first, making no mistake as to the nature of the campaign. I’ve also yet to see any stories on campaigns like that, with the exception of one in rpg horror stories, which showed pretty extreme racism.

ey59j2s,"So, thats a bunch of long words that mean two humped graph. Sex and gender are different things, but lets look at sex first cus genders not as well understood. So you can agree that birth sex is determined by a combination of different traits right? Well, if you plot all these traits with the entire human population, you would end up with a graph with two humps. Scientists used to draw a line between those humps, say ""This side's male, this side's female, wrap it up folks"" but are now they are taking a long hard look at it and realizing, well that was stupid. You see, shaping a box to fit 3.5 billion people who don't have much in common was a stupid idea and ended up with a weird box. So, scientists said, lets add a third box, intersex people. And then they realized that each of those boxes were stupidly large, and divided it up further. They kept on going until they realized that they could label every single human being on earth as having a unique sex. Sex is a spectrum that happens to fall into a distribution where most people are relatively close to one another at two points.

Now gender is a whole other thing. It is your gender identity, and its generally agreed that gender identity is a real and important thing and is a spectrum, like sex, that there is some biological reason that it exists, but noones been able to pin down the exact biological reasoning. It is however separate from sex.

ey5bl6s,"I have had a decade of trying to consider male feelings when discussing feminism slap me in the face. Every single time, no exceptions, men have used this consideration to try and sell me their misogyny, thinking I'll be more receptive to their brainwashing. We live in a society that worships male dicks and attacks women who fight the patriarchy as evil misandrist, while giving a free pass to mountains of normalised male misogyny, trying to sell it to us as a fact of life. So accepting how shitty men are (something our society knows but brainwashes us all our lives to ignore and excuse) has been a painfully slow process filled with constant disappointments every time any men spoke up. I wanted to believe they have a useful perspective to contribute and that there's men out there who are as angered by the mountains of misogyny as I am, I wanted to believe they can see all this misogyny our society is filled with regardless of how much it favors them. But every single time they spoke up about female rights, there was a stench of their male patriarchal brainwashing, even when they claimed to be feminist. In their minds female liberation always, *always* ended before toppling the patriarchal status quo that keeps them and their bros on top. Barring like one exception, I have never come across a man who had a belief in a world with no patriarchy whatsoever, with no caveats, no excuses, no exceptions. Just look at transwomen ffs. Even when men think they're women, dicks will still take priority over equality for women (in contrast with NB and transmen who recognise the system as unfair but who think it'll stop being their problem as long as they identify their way out of it).

I used to have far too much patience for men, I used to agree with people saying that sometimes radfems get too extreme or exclusionary. I used to believe male feminists exist. It took men abusing my faith in them hundreds of times, every single time they opened their mouth, to stop giving them the benefit of a doubt. They as a class seek to oppress women and work to uphold their religious patriarchal world order and anything resembling an exception to this rule is so extremely rare it doesn't justify giving them the benefit of a doubt.",transwomen,GCdebatesQT,GC: Do you think there is any weight to the claim that GC users tend to be misandrists?,https://reddit.com/r/GCdebatesQT/comments/cvnk2k/gc_do_you_think_there_is_any_weight_to_the_claim/ey5bl6s/

ey51mu6,"My best advice is what my best friend did when I first came out:  ask, support, never question, affirm.

-ask: ask her how she feels, what she wants.  One of the first questions I got from people who knew me for years is “so tell me about yourself”, which was wonderful because for me, the outward displayed personality was a manifest of repression, and not actually me.  Never assume, and ask.

-support:  if they need something, help.  Show that you’re there to listen, no matter if it seems like she’s “just whining” about the same stuff over and over.  Don’t know your gender, but if/when she wants to start wearing women’s clothes, that first time can be _much_ easier with a cisfemale friend going with you.

-never question: different from asking;  don’t question things that she says, unless she wants you to.  An obvious example is If she says she’s a woman, accept that; if she ends up wanting HRT, accept that; GCS or no, accept that.  And never imply she “wants” to be a woman:  we don’t choose to be trans, we only choose what we want to do about it.

-affirm:  pronouns don’t often get used in conversations, but find ways to do it.  Same with female nouns: girl, woman, lady, etc.  if you’re female, one of the biggest things you can say is “us women”.  For me, I am a woman first, and trans second, and being female is what matters.

Conversely, some of the worst things an ally can say (for me), are exclusionary and “othering”, such as “be glad you don’t have a period (because it’s a pain)”, or “be glad you can’t get pregnant”, or after being harassed or talked down to “now you know what it’s like to be a woman/well you wanted to be a woman”.

She will most likely feel that she’s ugly, brutish, stocky; reminder her she’s pretty, elegant.  It will take a while, but if you’re earnest, it will go along way towards building her confidence.

ey5by27,"Yeah my dad went the opposite route. 

He's been a super right wing libertarian conspiratard for longer than I've been alive. Which is ironic because his career path only saw him working in the private sector for about a total of 6 years of my 32 years on the planet. He was in the military when I was born, a cop most of my childhood and now has a cushy government job with his local city government.

He stockpiled guns, ammo, and bought a set of casts and reloading press during the Clinton administration because Democrats were gonna ""kick down his door and take his guns."" He cooled off after Bush won until 9/11, then went ultranationalist. He still believes Iraq had WMDs and international reaching chemical weapons, and he fucking *hates* Muslims. 

Obama saw his racism flare up in a way I hadn't seen since he and a group of other ""concerned citizens"", including the sheriff, pressured the only black family out of our small (sub 1000 population) town in the late 90s. Everyone assumed they were responsible for all the thefts in town, but it turned out the (white) heroin and oxy addicts were to blame.

He shared shit about Michelle Obama being transgendered, posted photos of monkeys on Facebook captioned ""the Obama family portrait"", and expressed desires to eliminate/exterminate the ""invading Muslim threat"", at which point, he joined a militia to *actively train for it*.

He posted some Clinton body count bullshit before the election, followed by some pizzagate bullshit, which I called out and was subsequently blocked. Haven't heard from him in three years and I couldn't be happier. Fuck that old racist.

That one can look at the arguments and make a judgement AFTER going through them? When TRAs dogmatically claim that anyone who disagrees with them is bigoted/uneducated/unwilling, that is not only condenscending, but also extremely arrogant.

I have arrived to my position by thinking about this for a while; the concept of gender identity was a term coined by Dr. John Money in 1955 to justify horrific experimentation on DSDs children. The term later was used by Butler to create the roots of Queer Gender Theory we know today. There is no evidence to suggest that brain differences in trans-identifying people mean that ""transition"" is the sole cure for their condition. I have personally written on how studies looking into that [show more evidence for trans-identifying people exhibiting markers of OCD](https://www.reddit.com/r/askAGP/comments/c9hol0/transsexualism_ocd_and_reduction_of_fractional/). I have partially done my homework, I engage regularly with self-aware people with autogynephilia who work on reducing their dysphoria by deconstructing it. I personally know one detransitioner IRL. I can see gender clinicians resigning over fears that they may be engaging in conversion therapy for young and confused gay children. I see endocrinologists appalled by the effects of puberty blockers and the resulting reduced muscle density/brain development. I see misappropriation of intersex conditions and a strong denialism of sex binaries (intersex conditions are sex specific. One is not less of a male or female if one is intersex. We are a sexually dimorphic species (egg and sperm) as a function of how we reproduce). I see a rampant denialism on paraphilic disorders as well, as well as denying paraphiles awareness of their own conditions to help them.

Can you say the same? I don't rationalise post hoc after making a judgement; but genuinely think the TRAs arguments are bad.

ey5cwz6,"It helps if you think of gender less as a set of checkboxes and more of a slider with ""male"" and ""female"" on the ends. Most people tend to fall roughly on either end with their gender identity, and that's all well and good. But there are also many people who fall towards the middle of the spectrum. Being nonbinary is under the transgender label. Nonbinary people are assigned the wrong gender at birth and transition to better align with their identity, just like binary trans people. So theres not much of an ""everything else"" about it really, it just a slightly different way to go about achieving the same goal, which is to live happily and authentically as your true self. As for pronouns, its simply a matter of using words who reflect who you are, just like with   ""he"" or ""she"". But as English and many other languages don't have established pronouns for those who aren't male or female, that leads to having to adapt pre-existing language (with the case of they/them pronouns) or by creating/using new ones that are more clearly singularly nonbinary. It can be a little difficult for those who are new to the concept and that's perfectly okay, but at the end of the day it's important to remember that we're all just people who want to be loved and respected, no matter who we are or what words we use. 

If youd like a short introduction to what it means to be nonbinary, I highly reccomend this video. It's only a couple of minutes long but It offers a clear and informative way for beginners to better understand nonbinary people, and gender as a whole.

ey5d659,"> Kids don't get HRT. In fact, you can't get HRT until you're 18 or older.

There's actually a scandal going on in the UK currently regarding this, because the biggest NHS-funded gender identity clinic in the country was found to be 'fast-tracking' patients toward treatment.  Since 2011, the clinic has been able to prescribe puberty-blocking medication to children as young as 11.  New research has also found that kids on puberty blockers after 1 year report significantly higher levels of suicidal thoughts and self harm and has also cast doubt on the previous assumptions that a normal puberty could be induced later, so the clinic is currently facing tough questions about the service they deliver.

ey5b2zv,"> He doesn't think toddlers/kids should be on HRT

To me, that shows both ignorance AND transphobia.

Kids don't get HRT. In fact, you can't get HRT until you're 18 or older.  
This comments usually come from transphobes that spread misinformation, like the story of the ""mother who forces her child to dress as a girl, but only wants to dress as a boy when with their father"" that was picked up by all the conservative websites. Look a little into the story and you quickly see that the mother was giving the choice to the child, they had both clothing available and the child made the choice themselves. The father actually prevented them from that choice by not having girl clothing available, while going on about how ""the kid can choose, and he chooses to be a boy"".

There was a lot of talk that the mother was giving the child hormone therapy and so on, CPS got involved, they found nothing and, in fact, found that the father was not giving the child the choice of clothing.

What is usually done when children are found to have body dis-morphia is that they follow the child for a while, then right before puberty, if the child still suffers from body dis-morphia and still identifies as the other sex, they block puberty completely, to give them the choice later on (ie when they're 18 and an adult) of which gender they want to be physically, and to make the transition less problematic.  
If a boy wants to be a boy, then they can just have a normal puberty later on, but they had the choice. Same thing for girls. However, if they still identify as the other sex, it helps a lot in the transition.

SJWs don’t use us as the butts of jokes. They don’t call people “retards” and “autists” as jokes, because that’s ableism and it’s bigotry. Anti-SJWs, however, as a group , do the exact opposite out of spite. They’ll call you an autistic retard and they’ll call me a tranny freak and no one wins except the system. I’m not going to lie, I understand what you mean about the left not tolerating dissent, and it’s frustrating that you can’t just step in and say “we’re all on the same side here, cut it out, dudes!” But what I think you should consider that the left is so prone to infighting because we all care. If my fellow socialist says something transphobic I’m damn well gonna call them out on it because the left is supposed to be an accepting space for trans people and if it’s not there’s a problem.

I can see how this can be very off-putting to someone entering the left, because no one is afraid to call you out on having bad takes. And they’re not always right. But they’re worth listening to. If the left always shuts you out it might be because you seem to come in guns blazing on the idea that they’re intolerant. I won’t lie, the left can be condescending and pedantic, but if you’re on chapo or something, and someone tells you that something you said was kinda racist, you’ll get a much better reaction if you continue with “ok, I’ll think about that, what about it was racist?” as opposed to “you’re a leftist SJW trying to destroy my freedom of speech.”

I don’t think the left wants to shut down all dissent. The left has a very, very long history of lively debate, disagreement, and dialectic, from Hegel to Zižek, from the Roman Forum to Reddit. I think that it’s just because the left is by definition almost, extremely passionate, the disagreement gets so heated it looks like a war. And some leftists would just say “well if you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen!” but I don’t think that’s very productive. Still, I don’t have a better solution. What I’m saying is I think you perceive the left to be angrier than it really is, especially if you get defensive which, no offense, you do kind of seem to.

I'm white. Mid twenties. Male. Autistic. I come from a democrat household, and a majorly republican and christian family. Though to be fair, my folks have never forced anything on me. They let me have my own opinions and never talked politics around me until I started to actually form my own ideas.

After Trump was elected, some of the nicest people I ever knew became absolute monsters. Not my folks. My friends. People who I knew in passing, or just people I knew for years, suddenly just became -viscious-. Any difference in opinion we had before was suddenly verboten. Any conversation, banned.

I grew up on the net. You can guess why. I'm no stranger to the abuse...I went through some stuff when I was younger, developing that emotional body armor. (Although that whole shtick wears a bit thin with me. I dont exactly think abuse should be necessary. But I make the best of it.) So when the places I went to discuss ideas and such became so hostile, I delt with it the same way I always did. You wrote them off and got on with your life.

You say you are a trans woman. That you are constantly belittled and made fun of. I understand that far too well. After all. Nobody cares, if they hurt the retards feelings, right?

I have a few trans friends. One I lost touch with, much to my regret. And a current one who has described the disconnect to me. Something I empathize with, to an extent. I have always been emotionally disconnected. So when people tell me of a disconnect with their own bodies and senses of self...I can only feel empathy.

So with all that on the table. All of that there. Do you think it's okay to do the same thing yourself? All I have seen from the supposed supportive left, since the slow days of 2013, has been hate. Disagreement is met with calls that I am right wing, and a nazi, despite being neither. My empathy has been outright used against me. My suffering been made fun of. My discomfort and inability to conform to the world made reasons why I should be disreguarded.

The -entire- Kavenaugh trial was the last staw. Accusations outside of the statue of limitations, reporters camped out on the front lawn day and night...one day I simply asked my folks, who had been rabid, if ruining the man's life was called for. Their response? ""Anything to stop a Sctous appointed judge.""

Anything. -Anything-. The ends justify the means. 

Is it really okay, for us to use the same tools as the enemy, no matter who we hurt? Can we not try to be -better-?

ey57g5s,"Hey bud? Your ""line"" is bad and potentially harmful, because it's not really a line, it's a subjective determination disguised as rationality. You buried the subjective stuff though, which shows that you're at least subconsciously aware of this problem. Look: you started with ""physical harm"", something everyone can agree with and is obvious...but then you said ""peer pressure"", which is like, ok, there's wiggle room there...but then you ended the definition of your ""line"" by saying ""otherwise infringing on anyone else's shit"".

And there's the rub. Who are **you** to decide if someone **else** is having their life, experience, voice, or anything else ""infringed"" upon by something? This is functionally the same as saying ""I can decide if an issue is important or harmful enough to warrant discussion or advocacy, and anyone who disagrees with me is irrational and worth mockery"".

I mean, who are you even hedging against supporting here? Do you think there are a significant number of people who are getting their hair in a twist over some gremlins being sexist in their basement somewhere? No! If someone is complaining about something, by definition it has entered the public consciousness in some way. Whether that's through the sale of a product or social media spreading an idea, the point is that a reaction cannot exist without a stimulus. So it seems that what you're really saying is that the sale of products or the spreading of ideas that can be used to create offensive scenarios in the ""privacy of one's home"" are not hurting anyone, so they shouldn't be complained about...but really? Do you really believe that ideas that are constantly reinforced in private do not leak out into the public? Do you think someone can be racist, sexist, ableist, or any other ist and not have that bleed into their public persona and ideas? Politics? Business decisions? 

You're not an arbiter. If someone with different experiences than you says ""hey, this thing that you think doesn't matter actually does affect me"", you need to at least listen. You don't have to get on the picket lines, but don't sit back and think you have the sharp dividing line between ""good"" and ""bad"" SJWs all neatly defined. Because until you know someone else's experiences, you cant judge if they have a reason to be upset.",,rpghorrorstories,Those damn SJWs ruined D&D with their female characters!!!,https://reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/cvmdtg/those_damn_sjws_ruined_dd_with_their_female/ey57g5s/

Is what the other person doing physically harming anyone, foisted on anyone who does not want to participate in it (people being pressured into it is a legitimate excuse to speak out, peer pressure sucks, not applicable in that situation) and otherwise infringing on -anyone elses- shit? 

If yes, speak out. Get involved. If someone's breaking someone's skull with a crobar, act. If someone's being a pushy asshole not leting somebody make their character or making shit sexual (themes that come up alot on this subreddit), or generally being a prick and pissing in other peoples coffee intentionally? You're good. If not? 

Then leave them the fuck alone. You dont have to participate. You dont gotta like it. But you do need to leave them the fuck alone.

ey5dqol,"So, it's fairly common for someone's confusion about gender to manifest in different ways throughout their life. If someone feels wrong in their gender, but doesn't know what it is or that they can feel that way, it can manifest in all sorts of ways. It can cause ones sexuality to be different from what they're actually really interested in, or it can trigger all sorts of anxiety/depressive disorders. It can also trigger a more hyper-sexual nature, or a less sexual nature... when there's all sorts of feelings around that aspect of yourself, and all sorts of social pressures on top of that, it can be hard to tell which way is up.

And many less feminine presenting women are put into the ""butch/tomboy lesbian"" box, so trans men who haven't sorted out the fact that they're trans might end up in that box due to social pressure. The same sort of thing can happen for less masculine men, resulting in a similar reversal for trans women.

I've been unwilling to live for the last 13 years out of my 29 years long life. I've never seen a purpose in being alive. A lot of shit happened - I've experienced really bad break ups, dying relatives, pets, I've been unsuccessful at stuff, etc.

6 years ago I've met a girl that I fell in love with, and fucked it up in about 6 months. Got even more depressed and unwilling to live. Haven't got enough guts to end my life though, so I've carried on.

Shortly after that fuck up, I've found another girl who shared my hobby. Can't say I was happy in that relationship, and it broke this march. Guess what? Deeper down into the depression hole (as if there's more room for that).

Was considering ending this shitshow again, but decided to do things I've been scared to do before. I've got pretty much nothing to lose, so why not?

So I've decided to reach out to some of my old friends, make some new ones, and most importantly - remember the girl from 6 years ago? - to apologize to her. I haven't had my hopes up for anything, was just trying to make things right for once.

Long story short, she's my girl now, and just that single fact made my 13 years long depression go away in an instant.

ey5fgll,"There's actually not a difference. Every definition that tries to differentiate pansexuality is also included by bisexuality and is defined by preferences, which isn't what defines a sexuality.

""Attraction to someone regardless of gender"" is bisexuality without a preference. That doesn't make it a new sexuality; preferences and lack of preferences can be a part of any sexuality, and bisexual people can also have no preference when it comes to attraction. What matters is what genders they are attracted to, which is ""all"".

""Pansexuals include trans people and bisexual doesn't"" is transphobic and flat out wrong, and most of the pan oeole who say that sound like chasers. Trans people are not a separate gender than what they identify as, and bisexuality has always included trans people, not just cis people.

""Pansexuals are attracted to all nonbinary genders and someone can be defined as bisexual if they like one binary gender and one nonbinary gender"". This is a flawed way of viewing nonbinary genders. Being nonbinary often means you have a unique experience with gender. Acting as if there are a clear and definable number of genders that a bisexual person could feasibly be attracted to specifically with no overlap between other genders misunderstands what ""nonbinary"" even means.

It’s unclear whether a racist person would be attracted to another race if they somehow stopped being racist.",transphobia,AskReddit,"Straight People, what do you want to ask about the LGBTQ+ community that you wouldn't ask in real life?",https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cvhgqx/straight_people_what_do_you_want_to_ask_about_the/ey5fppz/

I mean, if the reason it’s a dealbreaker is because you’re transphobic, then that would be a wrong reason. Just like saying you don’t date black people because you’re racist is a wrong reason. But there can be valid reasons. It’s just hard for anyone on the outside to know what a person’s internal reasons are.

EDIT: I don’t normally make edits in response to downvotes but in this case I’m legit confused. Did I make a typo that completely flips the meaning of my comment (I’ve done that before)? To try and rephrase what I’m saying, someone that’s not into trans people might have a reason that makes them a bad person (such as being transphobic) or they might have a reason that’s entirely neutral (such as where’s it’s no different than finding one hair color more attractive than another).

If anyone is exclusively attracted to a single sex - whether they're hetero or homosexuals - that can't be changed for anyone. 

As long as we all respect one another and treat one another kindly, it has absolutely nothing to do with who we date and why or why not. Whether we are fundamentally incompatible with their sex/gender, or we just don't like their hair, anybody can be romantically/sexually uninterested in anyone for any reason at any time.

ey5ftts,"While some of the answers  you got here were more or less on point, I would like to chime in as well. It's true, bi means two, but this ""redefinition of bisexuality"" is far from new. In  The 1990 Bisexual Manifesto published in the magazine *Anything That Moves* we can read the following:

>Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or duogamous in nature: that we have *""two""* sides or that we must be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don’t assume that there are only two genders. 

So for at least twenty years people have argued that bisexuality is not limited to men and women.\* Someone else here said that bisexual is attraction to several genders and that pansexuality is attraction to all genders, which is how I think about it as well. There is no clear and defined consensus about it, and there is a lot of overlap. The labels appeal to different people for different reasons, and sometimes they depend on context. I usually call myself bi, especially around cishets (non-queers) since the label has some history and odds are that they have at least heard of it. Among queers I might use pansexual because it's more likely that I won't be asked to hold a lecture on it. In actuality I don't care too much about labels anymore, and bi/pan would be secondary too me anyway (asexual would be primary).

Most of the time when people tell you ""I'm \~sexual"", just take them at face value. They know what they feel and what they are attracted to (this, of course, is not true. A lot of us are confused about many things, exploring emotions and attractions and trying out different labels. My point is, just be respectful).[I think this picture sums it up pretty well.](https://pics.me.me/bisexual-omnisexual-pansexual-polysexual-these-broadly-overlap-but-the-distinction-34314663.png)

&#x200B;

\*There are a few examples that make the situation a bit more complex than what it looks like on the surface.  If someone is exclusively attracted to women and non-binary people, wouldn't that make them more bi than pan? Or if a non-binary person would only be attracted to men and women would it make them straight (since hetero = other)?

>They don't in most Western nations?

Depending on which nation, sometimes no. Even in America many trans people cannot reveal themselves publicly without fear of actual violence against them or having their job or place of living taken away. They have to constantly hide or extinguish a core part of their identity.

>These days they can even openly play in competitive sports and make a joke of any fair competition.

Please show me where this is true outside of like rare examples I've seen in high school sports where they were literally doing it in protest of the fact that they were not allowed to compete in the division that would be most fair, IE a trans girl wrestling in the girls division openly said she would prefer to wrestle in the men's division but was *not allowed to* even though it was obviously unfair to the other girls. Would you prefer they not be allowed to play any sports at all?

The most common causes of mental illness imo are: Genetics, if your parents were mental, there is a good chance that you might also have issues. Problems during childbirth leading to a lack of oxygen. Poor nutrition. Bad parents, abusive, not involved or too involved. Lack of resilience. 

> acknowledging they exist

Who is denying that they exist?

> Presumably you have pronouns of some sort. Why are yours good?

While we are at it, could you please explain this whole pronoun malarky to me. Nobody in my life has ever used ""he/she"" when they were talking to me. They use ""you"". For example, ""How are you?"". 

The only time we use he/she is when we are talking about other people in the 3rd person when they are not there, ""He said that he was good."" 

So, it seems to me that transgender people want to control what people say about them. They want to force other people to comply to their worldview even when they are absent, which kinda fucked up if you think about it.

ey5hjis,"Yes, gender is a societal construct. And yes, sex is referring to the characteristics that define male and female. However, you cannot ignore that society is very very important, as I’m sure you know. It is really nice to toy around with the idea of disregarding all labels, but the fact of the matter is that I have to wake up tomorrow and at least attempt to make do.  My coworkers, my peers, my girlfriend, my family, etc. all expect me to be a functioning and productive member of society. I transitioned male to female and I pass 100%, I do consider myself as part of the gender binary. Assimilating was an important aspect to not only my validation but also as a functioning human. Non-binary people do exists and have a larger fight to fight, they/them is the common pronoun used to refer to them, and they/them has been part of the english language for a very very long time referring to singular people, so it’s not like trans people are asking for society to be restructured, just tweaked towards acceptance. 

Now with sex vs gender, you seem to have a good understanding that sex does not equal gender. But you seem to be hung up on how this functions practically. For example, I am trans, I was born male, but I have female genitalia now, female sex hormones, a female body fat distribution, female hair patterns etc. Does this make me female? I don’t know, I think it does, but plenty would argue against it. Does it mater? Only to me, my doctor, and my partner. Also, intersex people exist, chromosomes can be all sorts of weird for both cis and trans people, people who had had hysterectomies exist, people who have had trauma to the groin exist, cis women who don’t get periods exist and so on. In other words, what defines us biologically, especially if unseen, oftentimes doesn’t play into how we identify and should absolutely not play into how we are treated.

It seems like this is all about divorcing sex and gender. A male can be a man or woman or something in between. However, I don’t get what remains or what gender is without sex. Because then we are defining gender as a societal construct; as the set rules and norms and expectations associated with that gender.

Wouldn’t it be better to simply discard these rules and expectations which are inherently flawed, instead of describing yourself where you fall in this archaic definition of gender roles? Wouldn’t it be better to get rid of labels instead of creating dozens of labels and worrying about which is the perfect one? It seems to be that labeling is part of the problem and not the solution.

Now, I'm all for loving whoever and whatever genitals you want, but that's just it: genitals, past or present, can have a bearing on sexual attraction. Beyond the obvious medical issues that could arise if your brother did not know his BF was biologically male, it's not really that crazy outside of echo chambers like Reddit to think that someone's genitals, past or present, would have an effect on how attracted someone was to them. Your brother is a gay man; he likes penis, certainly pre-op and potentially post-op. Nevertheless, that's his preference to have, and it's fully within his rights to be turned off by a penis that used to be a vagina. That's not transphobic, that's just sexual preference. By hiding that from your brother, BF is more or less deliberately deceiving him while having sex, which is an unequivocally shitty thing to do. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself what matters more: BF's ""right"" to have sex with your brother, or your brother's right to know the genitals of the person he is having sex with.

I don’t think the left wants to shut down all dissent. The left has a very, very long history of lively debate, disagreement, and dialectic, from Hegel to Zižek, from the Roman Forum to Reddit. I think that it’s just because the left is by definition almost, extremely passionate, the disagreement gets so heated it looks like a war. And some leftists would just say “well if you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen!” but I don’t think that’s very productive. Still, I don’t have a better solution.

I'm white. Mid twenties. Male. Autistic. I come from a democrat household, and a majorly republican and christian family. Though to be fair, my folks have never forced anything on me. They let me have my own opinions and never talked politics around me until I started to actually form my own ideas.

After Trump was elected, some of the nicest people I ever knew became absolute monsters. Not my folks. My friends. People who I knew in passing, or just people I knew for years, suddenly just became -viscious-. Any difference in opinion we had before was suddenly verboten. Any conversation, banned.

I grew up on the net. You can guess why. I'm no stranger to the abuse...I went through some stuff when I was younger, developing that emotional body armor. (Although that whole shtick wears a bit thin with me. I dont exactly think abuse should be necessary. But I make the best of it.) So when the places I went to discuss ideas and such became so hostile, I delt with it the same way I always did. You wrote them off and got on with your life.

You say you are a trans woman. That you are constantly belittled and made fun of. I understand that far too well. After all. Nobody cares, if they hurt the retards feelings, right?

I have a few trans friends. One I lost touch with, much to my regret. And a current one who has described the disconnect to me. Something I empathize with, to an extent. I have always been emotionally disconnected. So when people tell me of a disconnect with their own bodies and senses of self...I can only feel empathy.

So with all that on the table. All of that there. Do you think it's okay to do the same thing yourself? All I have seen from the supposed supportive left, since the slow days of 2013, has been hate. Disagreement is met with calls that I am right wing, and a nazi, despite being neither. My empathy has been outright used against me. My suffering been made fun of. My discomfort and inability to conform to the world made reasons why I should be disreguarded.

The -entire- Kavenaugh trial was the last staw. Accusations outside of the statue of limitations, reporters camped out on the front lawn day and night...one day I simply asked my folks, who had been rabid, if ruining the man's life was called for. Their response? ""Anything to stop a Sctous appointed judge.""

Anything. -Anything-. The ends justify the means.

As far as the right wing thing being projection, no leftist or SJW has ever told me that who I am is fundamentally wrong, I was never ostracized or considered less than human there.

No.

Take for example, that Feminist famously known as 'big red'. I saw a video of a in depth conversation between her and some of her detractors. Thing is? When it came down to it, they didn't disagree all that much. **But the second you disagree, despute her authority, or voice a opinion that isn't carefully worded? You dont get a voice anymore.** 

That's my problem. You dont talk, in social justice. You get told. Or you get punished.

ey57g5s,"Hey bud? Your ""line"" is bad and potentially harmful, because it's not really a line, it's a subjective determination disguised as rationality. You buried the subjective stuff though, which shows that you're at least subconsciously aware of this problem. Look: you started with ""physical harm"", something everyone can agree with and is obvious...but then you said ""peer pressure"", which is like, ok, there's wiggle room there...but then you ended the definition of your ""line"" by saying ""otherwise infringing on anyone else's shit"".

And there's the rub. Who are **you** to decide if someone **else** is having their life, experience, voice, or anything else ""infringed"" upon by something? This is functionally the same as saying ""I can decide if an issue is important or harmful enough to warrant discussion or advocacy, and anyone who disagrees with me is irrational and worth mockery"".

I mean, who are you even hedging against supporting here? Do you think there are a significant number of people who are getting their hair in a twist over some gremlins being sexist in their basement somewhere? No! If someone is complaining about something, by definition it has entered the public consciousness in some way. Whether that's through the sale of a product or social media spreading an idea, the point is that a reaction cannot exist without a stimulus. So it seems that what you're really saying is that the sale of products or the spreading of ideas that can be used to create offensive scenarios in the ""privacy of one's home"" are not hurting anyone, so they shouldn't be complained about...but really? Do you really believe that ideas that are constantly reinforced in private do not leak out into the public? Do you think someone can be racist, sexist, ableist, or any other ist and not have that bleed into their public persona and ideas? Politics? Business decisions? 

You're not an arbiter. If someone with different experiences than you says ""hey, this thing that you think doesn't matter actually does affect me"", you need to at least listen. You don't have to get on the picket lines, but don't sit back and think you have the sharp dividing line between ""good"" and ""bad"" SJWs all neatly defined.

ey5hrlv,"Damn, this really resonates with me. I’m glad I’m not the only trans woman who’s been feeling this way. It’s gotten to the point that I’m hesitant to click on her videos. I’ve been watching her since I started transitioning, and I think The Aesthetic is a video that hurt me a good deal, since I was still early into my transition at the time, and because my trans experience is so extremely different from hers. It feels as though I should be able to relate to her but that I’m completely unable to and that does feel a bit alienating when I looked up to this person so much as a baby trans. 

I’m not high femme or a makeup goddess or very sexual and I’ll never have the money for FFS. And I think because of how The Aesthetic hurt me when I first saw it, when she is all of those things, it does make me feel a bit like less of a woman. But I have no interest in most of the things Natalie characterizes as feminine in her videos. And I know she’s since walked back on The Aesthetic, at least a little bit. But her videos have become alienating and dysphoria inducing for me to watch at this point. 

She makes good content, but I don’t think it’s for me anymore. I’m not sure how well she served the purpose of a role model, a purpose which I maybe never should have ascribed to her. But I probably won’t watch much of her future content simply for my own sake and sanity.

That would indeed be a consistent view.

Well, if you reject those that have transitioned, then you have at least some kind of an issue with the concept of gender transitioning.

ey5is7h,"I think the point they may have been driving at is that being trans, in and of itself, may not be a relevant factor- while several common symptoms of being trans might be.

A useful thought experiment might be to imagine that a few centuries in the future, surgical technology is sufficiently advanced that a post-surgery trans person is completely indistinguishable from a cis person: fully-functional genitalia, fertility, everything. If you would not want to date such a trans person, simply *because they were trans* and not because of any physical factors, then *that* would be prejudicial (specifically, transphobic): you're treating someone differently because of a factor that isn't relevant.

Most of the factors you listed are *symptoms* of being trans, rather than being inherent to transness. Not wanting to date people with particular genitalia is fine, and if you decide not to date a trans person because of what genitalia they have, that's not transphobic. It's transphobic if you decide not to date a trans person on the grounds that they are trans, rather than because of any one symptom of their transness.",transphobic,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey5is7h/

ey4c5mw,"Prejudice occurs only when someone treats two people differently despite there being no *relevant difference* between them, e.g. denying women the vote is prejudicial because there is no difference between men and women that is relevant to their ability to cast a reasonable vote. In contrast, enrolling only students that achieve a certain SAT score is not prejudicial because we consider a SAT scores a difference relevant to college admission decisions.

So, if refusing to date a transgender person is prejudicial, then there must be no difference between a transgender person and a cisgender person that is relevant to deciding who to date.

But there are many relevant differences, e.g. having a certain set of genitalia is an important consideration for many people when deciding who to date, so the fact that many transgender don't live up to this criteria is a difference to cisgender people that is relevant to a dating decision.",transgender,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey4c5mw/

Mental illness has a definition

[The APA: ](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender)A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder

What do you mean treating differently? Like refusing to sex with them?

Again I don't hate transwoman, I don't disgust transwoman, I don't have fear about transwoman, I don't treat them differently in regular social life...etc. I just don't want to sex with them.

>Of course not, so? There are cis women who also have a surgically created vagina. If the exact shape of the vagina is so important to you that you can't date a person that does not have the exact shape that you prefer, okay, that's maybe a little odd but not transphobic. If the only reason you're rejecting someone is because of their trans status, that's transphobic.

Firstly it matters where I stick my penis into and how does that feels for me. Also surgically created women's vagina and surgically created vagina for men is still different. The procedure is not even close. Ok let's say I also don't want to sex with a woman who has surgically created vagina if I can actually meet one in my lifetime. So I'm not transphobic in your case right? Also you are talking like the only difference between a man and woman is the vagina. There are many difference between man and woman both mentally and physically thus there are many differences between a woman and a transwoman.

Treating trans people differently *just because they're trans* is *the definition* of transphobia. Literally.

Of course not, so? There are cis women who also have a surgically created vagina. If the exact shape of the vagina is so important to you that you can't date a person that does not have the exact shape that you prefer, okay, that's maybe a little odd but not transphobic.

ey5is7h,"I think the point they may have been driving at is that being trans, in and of itself, may not be a relevant factor- while several common symptoms of being trans might be.

A useful thought experiment might be to imagine that a few centuries in the future, surgical technology is sufficiently advanced that a post-surgery trans person is completely indistinguishable from a cis person: fully-functional genitalia, fertility, everything. If you would not want to date such a trans person, simply *because they were trans* and not because of any physical factors, then *that* would be prejudicial (specifically, transphobic): you're treating someone differently because of a factor that isn't relevant.

Most of the factors you listed are *symptoms* of being trans, rather than being inherent to transness. Not wanting to date people with particular genitalia is fine, and if you decide not to date a trans person because of what genitalia they have, that's not transphobic.

In contrast, enrolling only students that achieve a certain SAT score is not prejudicial because we consider a SAT scores a difference relevant to college admission decisions.

So, if refusing to date a transgender person is prejudicial, then there must be no difference between a transgender person and a cisgender person that is relevant to deciding who to date.

But there are many relevant differences, e.g. having a certain set of genitalia is an important consideration for many people when deciding who to date, so the fact that many transgender don't live up to this criteria is a difference to cisgender people that is relevant to a dating decision.",transgender,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey4c5mw/

Basically, they won't even accept that there is any natural difference in physical performance between sexes (M and F.)

Of course it's disingenuous - I don't believe that we consider such fundamental aspects of cognition in our attraction. That's my point.

>To say this amounts to social performance is to all but deny individuals humanity.

Is it? The fact that we've developed these behavioural and cultural non-verbal languages to communicate our identities, like clothing or other gender performances, is totally a part of our humanity and it's beautiful.

I tried to use to p-zombie example to further articulate my point about the unhelpfulness of framing trans people as hiding their 'actual' gender, but I'm not really smart or articulate enough to tie it together satisfyingly.

I wasn't using it to claim that a trans man is a man because they look *exactly* like a cisgender man. That isn't necessarily true. But what does a man look like? Not all cisgender men look the same, so what characteristic makes them all look like men?

I don't know how we'd conclude this discussion, because to be honest in some ways I don't even know what I'm arguing against.

ey55rcp,">genetic men and women are different. On a whole range of physical attributes and psychological issues, men and women approach and see things differently

But so do men and other men, and women and other women. I believe there are indeed some general psychological differences between male and females - for example, I'm pretty sure guys have naturally better spacial awareness. I *don't* know if these differences have much real bearing on a person's personality - I think probably social context and messaging informs a person's personality far more - but I don't know how important any of this nitpicking is anyway.

You present the idea of not being attracted to a transgender person by virtue of the intrinsic, 'genetic' psychological traits of the gender they were assigned at birth. Now, I don't really understand how you could trace your attraction or lack thereof to these nebulous psychological differences, but let's assume you can. This is *still based on characteristics of a person's identity that are not dependent on 'transgenderedness'.*

Let's say being 'genetically' female consistently gives you the tangible personality trait *X*. If a trans guy thus also presents *X*, and *you aren't attracted to this trait*, then your lack of attraction is based on the trait *X* rather than transgender identity itself. This might seem like nitpicking, but I'm trying to show that you can't really 'logically' justify aversion to transgendered people just by virtue of their trans identity without taking into account other things.

But, again, I don't really buy the idea of any genetic trait that is unique to and consistent within guys or girls that influence your attraction to them.

>And so sheathing a genetic male in a female exterior does not black-and-white magically make that person female.

This is an argument that's often brought against trans people, and is pretty separate from our discussions up to this point.
You start by supposing male gender is purely 'genetic', but then claim that transgenderism is just hiding that reality in a female 'exterior'.
What makes that exterior female?
Probably the way she presents herself and interacts in society. Now, there are different schools of thought about this, but many believe that this social presentation and interaction is what gender actually essentially IS - just a social performance that serves to ""define and maintain identities"". This concept is called performativity and it's really fucking complex, but there's shit about it online to read about.

So someone's gender isn't an innate binary mode of being within their genetics; it actually exists AS the way they present their identity - it follows logically that a person who is, to all extents and purposes, presenting and performing a gender, IS that gender.

Asking for proof of the contrary is meaningless to me. There's a philosophical concept called the 'p-zombie' that's used in the philosophy of mind. It's a being that outwardly presents and behaves **exactly** like a human, but lacks any form of conscious experience or sentience. How does it prove that it's otherwise, and what use is it to question this anyway? We don't go around questioning people's consciousness or the existence of their mind, because it's a waste of time and isn't useful. Neither is questioning the gender identity of trans people, but of course this continues because people are sceptical.",transgender,changemyview,CMV : Not being interested in dating Transgender people is not Transphobic and the Implication that it is Transphobic is almost as bad as saying someone is Homophobic for not wanting to date Gay People.,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/cvdgyl/cmv_not_being_interested_in_dating_transgender/ey55rcp/

That’s in addition to gender dysphoria coming with its own set of potential psychological issues.

This all leads to, I think, if being perfectly legitimate to be exclusively not attracted to trans people because they are trans.

To label this a “phobia” is where the issue is. There are ALL KINDS of things I am not Attracted to, some are behaviors and some are things people are born with and can’t change. To me, trans is simply one of the latter. labeling a phobia demonizes a personal preference.

ey4yspk,"What exactly are these ""transgender traits"" that are unique to transgender people and not everyone else? Maybe the unusual height or build of a trans girl? But these are not traits of 'transgenderism', they're simply aspect of someone's physicality. **Of course** it's not necessarily transphobic or prejudiced to not be attracted to a trans woman or trans guy's body. 

Similarly, I refute the idea that being transgender has any direct correlation to personality. Again, what are these consistent 'transgender traits' are that necessarily have serious impact on a trans person's personality?

>You imply If I don’t find the idea of a trans person personally attractive (or at least not repellent) then by definition I am prejudiced.

All I'm suggesting is that if you **exclusively** aren't attracted to the **idea** of a trans person, then that is not a problem of just attraction to personality or physicality. It my opinion, it very possibly stems from something deeper, and ideological. This is what I was suggesting **may** be influenced by prejudice. But not necessarily intentionally!! I don't have the right or the knowledge to claim why someone is really thinking something. 

Also, if this prejudice exists like I think it does, it affects pretty much everyone. It's hard not to be affected, because we live in a society that has dismissed the existence of transgender identity until very recently.

And I will say ONE MORE TIME that I do not believe you can CONTROL what you innately find attractive, nor that lack of attraction to tangible elements of a personality is necessarily based in prejudice.

Yet further, you essentially make the same argument that you say isn’t being made. You imply If I don’t find the idea of a trans person personally attractive (or at least not repellent) then by definition I am prejudiced.

I never said anybody should be forced to like anything

I simply said it's possible to recognize when someone's aversion to something is along irrational lines

Being trans in and of itself has literally no tangible effect on the relationship in question, aside from internalized prejudice toward trans people

If I refuse to date people with one drop of black blood, I think it's safe to say that's an irrational aversion.

If I refuse to date people who once had chicken pox, I think it's safe to say that's an irrational aversion

If I refuse to date people whose first language happened to be Spanish, I think it's safe to say that's an irrational aversion 

If I refuse to date people over **any** characteristic that has no bearing on the relationship in question, I think it's safe to say that's an irrational aversion

There's no rational reason that someone being trans alone ought to be problematic

Like I said before, there are plenty of legit and rational qualities that can impede potential attraction to a trans person, and that's all cool

If it's just like a sense of ickyness, though, that's not really a rational basis for rejection. One shouldn't be forced to date anyone, of course, but it's important to note when the basis for that rejection is nothing more than internalized phobia

ey5lvv7,Maybe you should ask yourself what is the downside of a person being in a relationship with a trans person if you aren't transphobic? Why does your brother need to know? Why did you need to know or anyone else in school? Its so wildy inappropriate that cisgender demand to know a trans persons biological sex and genitalia. Just weird as fuck how you treat us as animals. You should ask this question in relationship advice or a transgender subreddit and give more background on their relationship instead of just talking about yourself.

Well yeah, because they are narcissists whose participation in the sheer faggotry of ""call-out culture"" isnt motivated by the desire to make a better society, its motivated by the dopamine hit they get from condemning someone and having all of the other bluecheka and the simps who follow them dogpile on and validate their ""righteous indignation"".

Shapiro, Crowder, Rubin etc aren’t organic phenomena. Peterson is an exception. The more far right ones are also exceptions, like Molyneux, but they would have a harder time getting followers if not for the general landscape especially on YouTube. Watch just one Shapiro video and you’ll get recommended Peterson then you’re just a couple clicks away from Molyneux.
