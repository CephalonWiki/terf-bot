         'Now that the more official stuff is out of the way, here is how I '
         'personally reconciled LGBT people and Christianity.  I use the word '
         '"Affirming" a lot and it\'s important to note the difference between '
         'someone "Accepting" LGBT people and "Affirming" them (and don\'t '
         'even get me started on "tolerance").  "Acceptance" is what you do at '
         'the end of grieving.  You *accept* a loss.  You *accept* the death '
         'of a loved one.  Someone who is accepting is someone who says "Well, '
         "I still don't like it but since I realize there's nothing I can do "
         'about it, I suppose I can welcome you into my home and be friendly '
         'with you and whatnot.  But really, if given the opportunity, I would '
         'change the situation."  Someone who is *Affirming* is someone who '
         'celebrates your identity.  Someone who loves you *because* of who '
         'you are instead of in spite of it.  An affirming parent might say '
         '"Oh you\'re gay?  Alright, do you have a girlfriend?" (or boyfriend '
         "if you're a dude).\n"
         '\n'
         'Also, when I mention "Christian Doctrine" I mean "Christian '
         'Doctrine" as I understand it.  There are thousands of different '
         'types of Christianity each with doctrine just a little different '
         'than all the others.  It should also be noted that once someone has '
         'made up their mind about something, it can take a long time to '
         'change it if they ever change it.  Anyone with Christian loved ones '
         'should not expect to shout theology at them and expect them to '

         'trans).\n'

         'Backstory: I was Christian long before I realized I was trans.  I '
         'had not been raised in the church, but had a general understanding '
         'of what Christianity was because my parents took us to Christmas Eve '
         'services with my grandparents and when I was 15 made the decision to '
         'be baptized and come to Christ.  The church I attended was (and as '
         'far as I know still is) *extremely* conservative.  While they were '
         'technically non-denominational, their views lined up very closely '
         'with Southern Baptist and Evangelical beliefs.  This is the '
         'environment that my faith was born into and like a sponge it '
         "absorbed *all of it*.  I'm ashamed at the views I used to have and "
         'worse be vocal about.\n'
         '\n'
         'During college I started to loosen up and slowly drift left.  I used '
         'to say I was far-right but ten years ago "far-right" meant something '
         "different than it does now.  Lets put it this way:  I don't know "
         "that I *would* have voted for Trump but I also don't know that I "
         "*wouldn't* have and that scares me.  Luckily, that young man doesn't "

         'I actually became LGBT affirming before I realized I was LGBT '
         'myself.  I was pretty against same-sex marriage until one day when I '

         'asked the audience if they believed that marriages between atheists, '
         'Muslims, Buddhists, etc were blessed and if not, they either needed '
         'to campaign against those too or not worry about same-sex marriage.  '
         "From there I slowly started to realize that God probably doesn't "
         "condemn homosexuality.  There's a lot of stuff online about how the "
         'places in Leviticus and Romans that damn homosexual behavior are '
         'probably mistranslated (a better translation would probably be '
         "pedophilia) but you can look those up on your own (they're in the "

         'gender  and  sexual  difference.  These  tactics  simultane-ously  '
         'negate  the  authenticity  of  transmen  and  transwomen’s  gender  '
         'and sexual  identities  and  reaffirm  the  heteronormative  '

         'differently  sexed  and  gendered bodies is normal, natural, and '
         'desirable. (442)  > The  taken-for-granted  expectation  that  '
         'heterosexuality  and  gender identity  follow  from  genitalia  '
         'produces  heteronormativity—even  though in most social interactions '
         'genitals are not actually visible. People do not expect a mismatch '
         'between “biological” credentials and gender presenta-tions  but  '
         'rather  assume  that  gendered  appearances  reflect  a  '
         'biologically sexed reality (West and Zimmerman 1987). This '
         'assumption is not always warranted.  Transgender  people—people  '
         'who  live  with  a  social  gender identity that differs from the '
         'gender they were assigned at birth—can successfully  do  '
         'masculinity  or  femininity  without  having  the  genitalia  that '
         'are presumed to follow from their outward appearance. (443)  > '
         'Transgender people have their claim to their gender category of '
         'choice challenged in these situations on the basis of genitalia, '
         'which in turn calls the heterosexuality of cisgender people they '
         'have been sexual with into question. (444).  > In sexualized '
         'situations, transmen’s masculinity is simultaneously reinforced—as '
         'men frame them as heterosexual men—and challenged—as women position '
         'them as homosexual women. (447)  > In sexualized situations, women '
         'frame transmen as deceptive—tricking women into seemingly '
         'heterosexual relationships without the necessary biological marker '
         'of manhood. (450)  > Perhaps  drawing  on  their  own  surprise  at  '
         'learning  that  someone who  looks  like  a  man  might  not  have  '
         'a  penis,  they  want  to  alert  other women who could be “tricked” '
         'into homosexuality.  (451)  > This difference  suggests  that  '
         'cisgender  people  react  more  strongly  toward transgender people '
         'who become the “opposite gender” but are presumed to still be the '
         '“same sex,” as they—and their entire gender—now run the risk of '
         'unwittingly engaging in homosexuality. Yet the public context of '
         'these relationships still mediates the methods used to enforce '
         'heteronormativity. (452)  > In  public  interactions  not  coded  '
         'as  sexual,  self-identity  and gender presentation can be '
         'sufficient to place someone in his or her gender category of '
         'choice—particularly in situations where this new identity is '
         'supported by people in authority positions. (459).  > The violent '
         'reactions  from  men  illustrate  the  real-life  outcomes  of  '
         'gender  socialization  that  requires  men  to  demonstrate  their  '
         'own  masculinity  and  hetero-sexuality through the devaluation and '
         'ridicule of male homosexuality and any presentations—by men or by '
         'women—of femininity (460).  > Sexual  and nonsexual   situations   '
         'require   different   degrees   of   “oppositeness.” Heterosexual '
         'interactions entail both opposite genitals as well as opposite '
         'gendered behavior. By contrast, nonsexual heterosocial interactions '
         'only require opposite gendered behavior, so self-identity can be '
         'accepted with-out biological credentials. As genitals are not '
         'visible in nonsexual situa-tions,  and  are  not  needed  to  '
         'engage  in  any  of  the  expected  behaviors  of the interaction, '
         'they are not required to establish membership in a gender category  '
         'for  nonsexual  relationships.  By  contrast,  genitals  are  a  '
         'central part of the social interaction of a sexual encounter, and so '
         'are used both to determine the genders of the people involved as '
         'well as the sexual ori-entation  of  the  encounter.  Thus,  the  '
         'criteria  for  gender  membership  are different  in  social  '
         'versus  (hetero)sexual  circumstances;  only  in  sexual situations '
         'is there a requirement that gender (self-presentation) equals sex '
         '(genitals). Accepting transgender people’s self-identity in '
         'nonsexual situ-ations does not threaten cisgender people’s claims to '
         'heterosexual status. Men  can  be homosocial  with  other  men,  '
         'including  those  who  lack  the biological credentials for '
         'maleness, without being homosexual. In sexual-ized circumstances, '
         'however, heterosexuality is threatened by the one-act rule  of  '
         'homosexuality.  Cisgender  men  stand  to  lose  not  just  their  '
         'sexual identity but also their standing as “real” men. (460)  I '
         'would add that I was never saying physical attraction has nothing to '
         'do with sexual orientation, of course it does. But physical '
         "attraction doesn't only mean what's in your pants, and in fact in "
         "most cases people probably never get that far. In most cases it's "
         'moreso gender presentation because when you see someone you see how '
         'they present, irrelevant of their genital sex. And your preference '
         'of what arouses or interests you determines your sexual orientation. '
         'If you make it to the point where genitalia comes into play and if '
         "there's an incongruence between the gender identity and genital sex, "
         'nobody is forcing you to be interested in that particular genital '
         "sex, but it doesn't retroactively turn an otherwise heterosexual "
         'attraction into a homosexual one (or vice versa), your sexual '
         'orientation and interest/arousal aligned heterosexually or '
         "homosexually with their gender identity/presentation. It's important "

         "> Transsexuality is an individual's unshakable conviction of "
         'belonging to the opposite sex, resulting in a request for '
         'sex-reassignment surgery. We have shown previously that the bed '

         'investigated the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus, which is composed of '
         'two subnuclei, namely interstitial nucleus of the anterior '
         'hypothalamus (INAH) 3 and 4. Post-mortem brain material was used '
         'from 42 subjects: 14 control males, 11 control females, 11 '
         'male-to-female transsexual people, 1 female-to-male transsexual '
         'subject and 5 non-transsexual subjects who were castrated because of '
         'prostate cancer. To identify and delineate the nuclei and determine '
         'their volume and shape we used three different stainings throughout '
         'the nuclei in every 15th section, i.e. thionin, neuropeptide Y and '
         'synaptophysin, using an image analysis system. The most pronounced '
         'differences were found in the INAH3 subnucleus. Its volume in '
         'thionin sections was 1.9 times larger in control males than in '
         'females (P< 0.013) and contained 2.3 times as many cells (P<0.002). '
         'We showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons '
         'of male-to-female transsexual people is similar to that of control '
         'females. The female-to-male transsexual subject had an INAH3 volume '
         'and number of neurons within the male control range, even though the '
         'treatment with testosterone had been stopped three years before '
         'death. The castrated men had an INAH3 volume and neuron number that '
         'was intermediate between males (volume and number of neurons P> '
         '0.117) and females (volume P> 0.245 and number of neurons P> 0.341). '
         'There was no difference in INAH3 between pre-and post-menopausal '
         'women, either in the volume (P> 0.84) or in the number of neurons '
         '(P< 0.439), indicating that the feminization of the INAH3 of '
         'male-to-female transsexuals was not due to estrogen treatment. **We '
         'propose that the sex reversal of the INAH3 in transsexual people is '

         'fundamental perception experienced by all individuals that extends '

         'their sexual characteristics do not reflect their true gender, they '
         'constitute an invaluable model to understand the biological '

         'sex (30 control men), or people who share their gender identity (30 '
